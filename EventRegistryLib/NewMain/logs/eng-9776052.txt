That kept Treasury bond yields elevated and the dollar trading near multiyear highs against its global peers.\n\nA benign June CPI inflation report, however, as well as slowing gains in the labor market and softening consumer sentiment, has given way to renewed bets that the Fed will implement the first of a series of quarter-point rate cuts in September.\n\nAnd that's setting up what could be a difficult, if not impossible, challenge for Powell when he faces the media Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Fed's current lending rate sits at a two-decade high of between 5.25% and 5.5%. And while no change is expected tomorrow in Washington, Powell will need to both signal the need, and indeed the intention, for a rate cut in six weeks' time while simultaneously explaining to markets why he wasn't prepared to do so this week.\n\nFed faces an 'awkward' challenge\n\n\"It will be a little awkward [for the Fed] when they try to telegraph that they'll cut soon while trying to explain why they're not cutting now,\" said Bryce Doty, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates.\n\nThe case for a cut, while by no means a slam dunk, is certainly compelling: The three-month annualized rate for core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge, is now around 1.5%, well below its 2% threshold.\n\nUnemployment, while low, is now ticking higher and was last pegged at 4.1%. That level could accelerate into the autumn months as hiring slows and the impact of past Fed rate cuts chokes off credit growth.\n\nRelated: PCE inflation report cements timing of next Fed interest rate cut\n\nHowever, the case against a September cut is just as compelling: The economy grew at a much stronger-than-expected rate of 2.8% last quarter, and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecasting tool suggests that pace is holding firmly into the end of July.\n\nRecent job-market data, while softening, still suggests a tight labor market with around 8.18 million positions remaining unfilled over the month of June.\n\n\"So far, the Fed has been able to thread the needle that softens inflation without inducing recession,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede.\n\n\"But if inflation pressures continue to back off, the Fed will go from a laser focus on the price stability half of its dual mandate to a more balanced approach that considers a situation in which normalization begins to turn into deterioration due to tight monetary policy,\" he cautioned.\n\nFed: Waiting for Godot\n\nThat puts the Fed in its current bind: Waiting for September raises the risk that it could fall behind the curve in reacting to changes in job and inflation data, while acting now could suggest Fed officials are seeing something in the economy that investors aren't.\n\n\"A surprise rate cut this week could cause an adverse market reaction and force investors to question why the Fed felt it was necessary to cut rates ahead of expectations,\" said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. He argues that most would conclude that \"the economy and labor market have deteriorated more quickly than expected.\"\n\nRelated: GDP report jolts Fed soft-landing hopes\n\nPowell himself has hinted at the nature of this dilemma. He's told investors that the balance of risks between faster inflation and slowing employment is now more evenly spread, suggesting a path toward a September cut that would still need to be confirmed by incoming data.\n\nBut Richard Ratner, senior vice president at Bel Air Investment Advisors, sees it differently, saying markets will react to the kind of message he delivers in his post-decision news conference.\n\n\"In my view, inflation is no longer the problem. It's growth, and the Fed should be keeping this in mind,\" Ratner said.\n\n\"As for markets, they will be reacting to his comments following the decision,\" he added. \"If [Powell] remains hawkish, markets will likely price out a cut in September and equity markets will sell off as sentiment is hurt.\"\n\nCatchup cuts?\n\nDoty at Sit Investment Associates, however, sees any market pullback from a hawkish Fed message as a buying opportunity, arguing that \"the longer and slower it takes to the Fed to reduce interest rates, the more they will need to do later to 'catch up' as households continue to struggle.\"\n\nRight now, markets seem to be hedging that exact bet: CME Group's FedWatch is now pricing in three rate cuts between now and the end of the year, with the Federal Funds rate falling to 4.625% by the close of the December meeting.\n\nRelated: Former Fed official changes tune on what's next for interest rates\n\nIf the Fed's first cut comes in September, as expected, that would mean the longest stretch between the most recent hike, in July 2023, and the next reduction.\n\nQuickening that pace over the final two meetings of the year would certainly fall into the catchup theory as well, although the Fed isn't the only one changing its recent tune.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\nGoldman Sachs, which as recently as two months ago was forecasting no change in the Federal Funds rate until 2025, is now expecting at least two cuts between now and year's end.\n\n\"There's no question there are some shifts in consumer behavior, and the cumulative impact of what's been kind of a long inflationary pressure, even though it's moderating, is having an effect on consumer habits,\" Chief Executive David Solomon told CNBC Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of

Waiting For Fed Rate Cuts In An Election Year", "body": "Investors, policymakers, and business leaders are eagerly waiting for the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. If they expect a rate cut this week, they're likely to be sorely disappointed.\n\nThe Fed is meeting this week and will issue a policy decision tomorrow (July 31, 2024) at 2 pm ET.\n\nWhile Fed rate cuts are coming, a change in policy is wildly unlikely this week.\n\nThe reason?\n\nInflation is too high, jobs data are too good, and the economy is too strong.\n\nWith a real GDP growth rate of 2.8% in Q2 2024, an unemployment rate of 4.1%, and consumer inflation rates still above 2%, the Fed is unlikely to budge tomorrow.\n\nThere is great hope for a rate cut in September. But a September Fed rate cut may yet be dashed by a mix of high inflation, solid economic data, and uneasy political climate.\n\nThe upper bound of the federal funds rate target range has been at 5.50 percent for over a year -- since July 2023. Executives, stockholders, and homebuyers would like to see lower interest rates.\n\nBecause the economy and inflation are such hot-button issues in this year's election, the Fed is under more scrutiny than usual when making policy decisions.\n\nThe Fed prides itself on being an apolitical entity, and to support that claim, the FOMC needs to do two things:\n\nJust as independent auditors need to be independent and also maintain the appearance of independence, the Fed needs to be -- and appear to be -- independent. Yet maintaining the Fed's appearance of independence ahead of the 2024 presidential election will require more due care than usual.\n\nPractically speaking, the Fed will need ironclad data to support its decision if it should wish to cut interest rates on September 18, 2024. The Fed's 2% consumer inflation target is one such data point. Weakening jobs or growth data would be another.\n\nInflation has been the Fed's top priority against the backdrop of a solid economy, and there will only be two CPI reports and one PCE report between now and the September Fed meeting. Based on recent data, it is very unlikely that we will see 2% year-on-year consumer inflation in the reports available by September 18th for any of the key U.S. series, including the CPI, Core CPI, PCE, or Core PCE.\n\nSince inflation isn't likely to fall to the target the Fed has often publicly supported, weak jobs or weak growth data would likely be required to justify Fed rate cuts.\n\nWhile the labor market could weaken further, GDP growth is solid. The Q2 GDP report last week showed solid growth at 2.8% -- and that's the last Advance GDP release before the September Fed decision.\n\nThis leaves the health of the labor market as the key factor likely to impact Fed policy in the short term -- and there are only two more jobs reports before the September Fed decision, with releases on August 2, 2024, and September 6, 2024.\n\nAlthough job gains could slow and the unemployment rate could rise further, jobless claims remain relatively low, and JOLTS job openings are still very high at almost 8.2 million jobs for June 2024, according to the BLS report released today.\n\nWith a contentious political backdrop ahead of the 2024 U.S. elections, the high threshold of ironclad economic data that justifies Fed rate cuts has not yet been met. Moreover, it seems unlikely to be met by September. Unless something drastic happens economically between now and September 18th, market participants may need to wait for a rate cut until November 7, 2024.\n\nOf course, the Fed could still cut rates in September. But if Fed members intend to cut in September, they would need to begin messaging that well in advance to try and mitigate any potential political blowback.\n\nFor example, the FOMC could signal something in its statement tomorrow. Plus, Fed Chair Powell has two big chances in the next month to socialize the idea of a September rate cut -- at his press conference tomorrow after the Fed decision and at the Kansas City Fed meeting at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August.\n\nThe currently available U.S. jobs and growth data do not reflect great urgency to cut interest rates, especially since inflation is still above the Fed's target.\n\nSo, if the Fed intends to change course, the FOMC will need to telegraph its intentions soon. Without even a hint of a potential September rate cut tomorrow, the odds will increase for the first cut of the year to be in November.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironclad_warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ironclad warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson Hole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66a92c87d4e844bd53d1deb7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 2132, "textEnd": 2146, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-09-", "textStart": 1694, "textEnd": 1706}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

That kept Treasury bond yields elevated and the dollar trading near multiyear highs against its global peers.\n\nA benign June CPI inflation report, however, as well as slowing gains in the labor market and softening consumer sentiment, has given way to renewed bets that the Fed will implement the first of a series of quarter-point rate cuts in September.\n\nAnd that's setting up what could be a difficult, if not impossible, challenge for Powell when he faces the media Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Fed's current lending rate sits at a two-decade high of between 5.25% and 5.5%. And while no change is expected tomorrow in Washington, Powell will need to both signal the need, and indeed the intention, for a rate cut in six weeks' time while simultaneously explaining to markets why he wasn't prepared to do so this week.\n\nFed faces an 'awkward' challenge\n\n\"It will be a little awkward [for the Fed] when they try to telegraph that they'll cut soon while trying to explain why they're not cutting now,\" said Bryce Doty, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates.\n\nThe case for a cut, while by no means a slam dunk, is certainly compelling: The three-month annualized rate for core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge, is now around 1.5%, well below its 2% threshold.\n\nUnemployment, while low, is now ticking higher and was last pegged at 4.1%. That level could accelerate into the autumn months as hiring slows and the impact of past Fed rate cuts chokes off credit growth.\n\nHowever, the case against a September cut is just as compelling: The economy grew at a much stronger-than-expected rate of 2.8% last quarter, and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecasting tool suggests that pace is holding firmly into the end of July.\n\nRecent job-market data, while softening, still suggests a tight labor market with around 8.18 million positions remaining unfilled over the month of June.\n\n\"So far, the Fed has been able to thread the needle that softens inflation without inducing recession,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede.\n\n\"But if inflation pressures continue to back off, the Fed will go from a laser focus on the price stability half of its dual mandate to a more balanced approach that considers a situation in which normalization begins to turn into deterioration due to tight monetary policy,\" he cautioned.\n\nFed: Waiting for Godot\n\nThat puts the Fed in its current bind: Waiting for September raises the risk that it could fall behind the curve in reacting to changes in job and inflation data, while acting now could suggest Fed officials are seeing something in the economy that investors aren't.\n\n\"A surprise rate cut this week could cause an adverse market reaction and force investors to question why the Fed felt it was necessary to cut rates ahead of expectations,\" said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. He argues that most would conclude that \"the economy and labor market have deteriorated more quickly than expected.\"\n\nPowell himself has hinted at the nature of this dilemma. He's told investors that the balance of risks between faster inflation and slowing employment is now more evenly spread, suggesting a path toward a September cut that would still need to be confirmed by incoming data.\n\nBut Richard Ratner, senior vice president at Bel Air Investment Advisors, sees it differently, saying markets will react to the kind of message he delivers in his post-decision news conference.\n\n\"In my view, inflation is no longer the problem. It's growth, and the Fed should be keeping this in mind,\" Ratner said.\n\n\"As for markets, they will be reacting to his comments following the decision,\" he added. \"If [Powell] remains hawkish, markets will likely price out a cut in September and equity markets will sell off as sentiment is hurt.\"\n\nCatchup cuts?\n\nDoty at Sit Investment Associates, however, sees any market pullback from a hawkish Fed message as a buying opportunity, arguing that \"the longer and slower it takes to the Fed to reduce interest rates, the more they will need to do later to 'catch up' as households continue to struggle.\"\n\nRight now, markets seem to be hedging that exact bet: CME Group's FedWatch is now pricing in three rate cuts between now and the end of the year, with the Federal Funds rate falling to 4.625% by the close of the December meeting.\n\nIf the Fed's first cut comes in September, as expected, that would mean the longest stretch between the most recent hike, in July 2023, and the next reduction.\n\nQuickening that pace over the final two meetings of the year would certainly fall into the catchup theory as well, although the Fed isn't the only one changing its recent tune.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\nGoldman Sachs, which as recently as two months ago was forecasting no change in the Federal Funds rate until 2025, is now expecting at least two cuts between now and year's end.\n\n\"There's no question there are some shifts in consumer behavior, and the cumulative impact of what's been kind of a long inflationary pressure, even though it's moderating, is having an effect on consumer habits,\" Chief Executive David Solomon told CNBC Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "thestreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheStreet"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Two years ago, in July 2022, the rate was 2.25% to 2.50%. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate was 1.50% to 1.75% in January 2020.\n\nRecent inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, and the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates aggressively in an attempt to bring inflation down to 2%.\n\nTwo years later, consumer prices declined 0.1% in June compared with May, and annual inflation came in at 3%. This annual inflation rate was down from 3.3% in May, and was lower than economists expected.\n\nBut Triest explains that the Federal Reserve is trying to pull off a balancing act -- cool the economy and tamp down inflation by raising interest rates, but not throw the economy into a recession.\n\nThus, the Fed is also looking closely at economic growth, which was up this quarter at 2.8% (more than economists expected) and the labor market, which has avoided (so far) a sharp pullback.\n\nTriest says these data are \"consistent with being the right time to cut\" for the Fed.\n\nHe adds, however, that the Fed usually telegraphs its intentions through speeches or statements.\n\n\"There hasn't been that,\" Triest says. \"So they may prefer to begin that kind of preparation now and then actually wait until the September meeting to cut rates.\"\n\nSo, Triest is looking for two things in the statement that the Fed releases Wednesday afternoon after its meeting and in Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference.\n\nFirst is how the Fed will classify inflation.\n\n\"There's a paragraph (in the statement) on the balance of risks, and they probably will downgrade the inflation risk part of that statement,\" Triest says.\n\nSecond will be hints at a rate cut in September, the kind of prepping of the market that usually precedes a policy change.\n\n\"The Fed is very unlikely to explicitly say that they're cutting in September,\" Triest says. \"But I think it's likely that if they don't cut directly tomorrow, that they will hint at that in the statement and that Powell will further elaborate on that.\"\n\nFinally, Triest is looking even beyond September.\n\n\"The question is will the Fed be cutting interest rates regularly, at every meeting, every other meeting, or Powell may just want to talk about only September,\" Triest says.", "source": {"uri": "news.northeastern.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.northeastern.edu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trieste"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trieste"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Inflation1400.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 1489, "textEnd": 1501}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

And the job market has cooled, with the unemployment rate rising about a half-point this year to 4.1%. Fed officials have said that they are seeking to balance the need to keep rates high enough to control inflation without keeping them too high for too long and causing a recession.\n\nRate cuts -- as early as September -- could help the Fed achieve a \"soft landing,\" in which high inflation is defeated without an economic downturn. Such an outcome might also affect this year's presidential race, as Republicans have sought to tie Vice President Kamala Harris to the inflation spike of the past three years. Former President Donald Trump said the Fed shouldn't cut rates before the election.\n\n\"While I don't believe we have reached our final destination, I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted,\" Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said earlier this month.\n\nFinancial market traders have priced in 100% odds that the central bank will reduce its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to futures markets, so Fed Chair Jerome Powell does not need to provide further guidance to markets Wednesday about the timing of a cut, economists say.\n\nInstead, Powell will have more opportunities in the coming months to illustrate how the Fed is thinking about inflation and interest rates, particularly in his speech in late August at the annual Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. As a result, he may not provide much of a hint Wednesday regarding how quickly the Fed will cut rates after it starts doing so. Economists expect relatively gradual cuts, unless there is evidence the job market is faltering, which would spur the Fed to move faster.\n\nEven so, the Fed could alter several parts of the statement it releases after each meeting to lay the groundwork for a cut in September.\n\nIn the statement it released after its June meeting, for example, Fed officials said, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the (Fed's) 2% inflation objective.\" On Wednesday, the Fed could drop \"modest\" or alter it in some other way to underscore that additional progress on inflation has been achieved.\n\nIn the latest piece of good news on price increases, on Friday the government said that yearly inflation fell to 2.5% in July, according to the Fed's preferred inflation measure. That is down from 2.6% the previous month and the lowest since February 2021, when inflation was just starting to accelerate.\n\nOne encouraging sign for the Fed is that rental prices, a key driver of broader inflation, have started to noticeably cool, as new apartment buildings have been completed in many large cities.\n\nRental inflation was a leading example of what economists call \"catch-up\" inflation, in which prices were still rising this year because of distortions from the pandemic economy. Many Americans sought more living space or moved out on their own during COVID, pushing up the cost of rents and homes.\n\nThe government's rental inflation measures have been rising faster than usual, well into this year, to reflect those increases.

Each time the committee meets, it could mean a change to the .\n\nA change in this rate not only impacts financial institutions but also your bottom line. With July's meeting underway, Americans are waiting with anticipation to learn whether the Fed will finally lower its target rate.\n\nWhat's the likelihood of a rate reduction this year? Here's what the experts think.\n\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions charge each other for ultra-short-term loans, usually overnight. It's expressed as a range, and financial institutions negotiate a specific rate within that range.\n\nThe federal funds rate plays a key role in the management of inflation. When inflation is too high, the Fed typically raises its rate to reduce consumer spending and slow economic activity. Conversely, the Fed may lower its rate to stimulate economic activity and growth.\n\nThe federal funds rate doesn't directly affect the rates offered by individual banks, but it does have an influence. When the Fed's target rate increases or decreases, rates for , (CDs), , , , and other banking products generally follow suit.\n\nThat means when the Fed's rate is high, it can be a good time to deposit money in a bank account and earn more interest. When it's low, it's a good time to borrow money or refinance at a lower interest rate.\n\nRead more:\n\nOver the last year, the federal funds rate has remained unchanged. The FOMC has expressed that it will wait to make any changes until it has confidence we're making progress toward its 2% inflation target. The Fed is meeting again on July 30-31 and will decide whether or not to adjust the federal funds rate.\n\nHere's a look at how rates changed in 2023 before the Fed hit pause on rate changes:\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Fed's job is to carefully monitor the economy and maintain stability. During each meeting, it may adjust its target rate and overall monetary policy based on what the economy needs to continue running smoothly. However, it doesn't necessarily announce its plans ahead of time.\n\nEconomic experts monitor the economy's health closely and formulate their own ideas about the Fed's next move based on the data they have available. Some experts believe that this upcoming meeting could set the stage for future rate cuts. Here's what they had to say.\n\n\"Second quarter inflation, most notably the broad-based price declines in the June CPI, was good enough to give the Fed more -- but not yet full -- confidence that inflation is moving toward 2%,\" said Sophia Kearney-Lederman, senior economist at .\n\n\"This means the Fed is unlikely to make any changes to the federal funds target rate at the July 31 meeting,\" she added. Instead, Kearney-Lederman said she expects the Fed will use this meeting to tee up for a rate cut at the September meeting. However, she noted, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will likely emphasize in his post-meeting press conference that the Fed doesn't make decisions about future meetings in advance. So any decision to ease rates in September will be data-dependent.\n\n\"We expect the Fed will cut rates once, if not twice, before the end of the year,\" Kearney-Lederman said. \"Further evidence of progress on inflation will determine when the first cut comes this year.\"\n\n\"Since the start of the year, the Fed has clearly telegraphed that its next move will be a rate cut,\" said Lara Rhame, chief U.S. economist at . \"And yet, the opportunity has been elusive, and markets have been too optimistic in pricing rate cuts into the forward curve.\"\n\nRhame said she expects the Fed to cut rates twice in the second half of 2024, with the first rate cut occurring in September. \"I characterize this as a surgical rate cut -- think: a nip and a tuck -- under careful conditions of inflation data and market expectations,\" she said. \"I expect the Fed to be patient...looking ahead to 2025, markets have four rate cuts priced in. If the economy continues on its current healthy trajectory, this is likely -- once again -- going to prove to be too optimistic.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nRegardless of whether the federal funds rate changes, it's a good time to evaluate your banking products and potentially make some savvy money moves that could pay off later.\n\nRight now, the is well below 1%.

If your interest rate isn't competitive, you could be leaving money on the table.\n\nTake stock of your current deposit accounts, shop around, and see if you're getting the best rates possible. If you're not, it could be time to switch banks or open up a new type of account.\n\nOne of the major perks of a CD is that it offers a fixed interest rate for the entire term. This allows you to lock in a high APY ahead of any potential rate cuts.\n\nKeep in mind that if you make a withdrawal before your CD reaches maturity, you'll be subject to an . So be sure to carefully consider your savings goals before tying up your money in a CD. If you're saving for a longer-term goal (six months to two years), opening a CD and securing a higher rate could help you reach it even faster.\n\nIf you're preparing for a big-ticket purchase (like a car or ), applying for a new loan now could potentially lock you into a higher interest rate.\n\nIt's impossible to predict with certainty how the Fed will change rates -- if at all.

And the job market has cooled, with the unemployment rate rising about a half-point this year to 4.1%. Fed officials have said that they are seeking to balance the need to keep rates high enough to control inflation without keeping them too high for too long and causing a recession.\n\nRate cuts -- as early as September -- could help the Fed achieve a \"soft landing,\" in which high inflation is defeated without an economic downturn. Such an outcome might also affect this year's presidential race, as Republicans have sought to tie Vice President Kamala Harris to the inflation spike of the past three years. Former President Donald Trump said the Fed shouldn't cut rates before the election.\n\n\"While I don't believe we have reached our final destination, I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted,\" Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said earlier this month.\n\nFinancial market traders have priced in 100% odds that the central bank will reduce its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to futures markets, so Fed Chair Jerome Powell does not need to provide further guidance to markets Wednesday about the timing of a cut, economists say.\n\nInstead, Powell will have more opportunities in the coming months to illustrate how the Fed is thinking about inflation and interest rates, particularly in his speech in late August at the annual Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. As a result, he may not provide much of a hint Wednesday regarding how quickly the Fed will cut rates after it starts doing so. Economists expect relatively gradual cuts, unless there is evidence the job market is faltering, which would spur the Fed to move faster.\n\nEven so, the Fed could alter several parts of the statement it releases after each meeting to lay the groundwork for a cut in September.\n\nIn the statement it released after its June meeting, for example, Fed officials said, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the (Fed's) 2% inflation objective.\" On Wednesday, the Fed could drop \"modest\" or alter it in some other way to underscore that additional progress on inflation has been achieved.\n\nIn the latest piece of good news on price increases, on Friday the government said that yearly inflation fell to 2.5% in July, according to the Fed's preferred inflation measure. That is down from 2.6% the previous month and the lowest since February 2021, when inflation was just starting to accelerate.\n\nOne encouraging sign for the Fed is that rental prices, a key driver of broader inflation, have started to noticeably cool, as new apartment buildings have been completed in many large cities.\n\nRental inflation was a leading example of what economists call \"catch-up\" inflation, in which prices were still rising this year because of distortions from the pandemic economy. Many Americans sought more living space or moved out on their own during COVID, pushing up the cost of rents and homes.\n\nThe government's rental inflation measures have been rising faster than usual, well into this year, to reflect those increases. This even as rapid apartment building has slowed cost increases for new leases.

Many Americans sought more living space or moved out on their own during Covid, pushing up the cost of rents and homes.\n\nThe government's rental inflation measures have been rising faster than usual, well into this year, to reflect those increases. This even as rapid apartment building has slowed cost increases for new leases. Other examples of \"catch-up\" inflation include car insurance, which soared more than 20 percent earlier this year from a year ago, as insurance companies have charged more to reflect the pandemic-era spike in new-car prices. Yet, even car insurance costs have started to rise more slowly.\n\nPowell has long said the Fed was seeking \"greater confidence\" that inflation was falling back to the Fed's 2 percent target. Earlier this month -- even before the latest inflation readings -- he said that recent inflation data does \" add somewhat to confidence \" that it is cooling.\n\nPowell and other Fed officials have also worried that strong job growth and rapidly rising paychecks would potentially fuel inflation, as some companies would likely raise prices to offset the higher labor costs.\n\nBut hiring and wage growth have slowed in recent months, and Powell this month acknowledged the job market is \"not a source of broad inflationary pressures for the economy.\"\n\nOn Friday, the government will release a quarterly measure of wage growth, which is likely to show that paychecks, while still growing at a healthy pace, are not growing as fast as a year ago, adding to evidence that inflationary pressures have eased.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson Hole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://businessmirror.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BusinessMirror-KnowMore-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 1465, "textEnd": 1476}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

That kept Treasury bond yields elevated and the dollar trading near multiyear highs against its global peers.\n\nA benign June CPI inflation report, however, as well as slowing gains in the labor market and softening consumer sentiment, has given way to renewed bets that the Fed will implement the first of a series of quarter-point rate cuts in September.\n\nAnd that's setting up what could be a difficult, if not impossible, challenge for Powell when he faces the media Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Fed's current lending rate sits at a two-decade high of between 5.25% and 5.5%. And while no change is expected tomorrow in Washington, Powell will need to both signal the need, and indeed the intention, for a rate cut in six weeks' time while simultaneously explaining to markets why he wasn't prepared to do so this week.\n\nFed faces an 'awkward' challenge\n\n\"It will be a little awkward [for the Fed] when they try to telegraph that they'll cut soon while trying to explain why they're not cutting now,\" said Bryce Doty, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates.\n\nThe case for a cut, while by no means a slam dunk, is certainly compelling: The three-month annualized rate for core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge, is now around 1.5%, well below its 2% threshold.\n\nUnemployment, while low, is now ticking higher and was last pegged at 4.1%. That level could accelerate into the autumn months as hiring slows and the impact of past Fed rate cuts chokes off credit growth.\n\nRelated: PCE inflation report cements timing of next Fed interest rate cut\n\nHowever, the case against a September cut is just as compelling: The economy grew at a much stronger-than-expected rate of 2.8% last quarter, and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecasting tool suggests that pace is holding firmly into the end of July.\n\nRecent job-market data, while softening, still suggests a tight labor market with around 8.18 million positions remaining unfilled over the month of June.\n\n\"So far, the Fed has been able to thread the needle that softens inflation without inducing recession,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede.\n\n\"But if inflation pressures continue to back off, the Fed will go from a laser focus on the price stability half of its dual mandate to a more balanced approach that considers a situation in which normalization begins to turn into deterioration due to tight monetary policy,\" he cautioned.\n\nFed: Waiting for Godot\n\nThat puts the Fed in its current bind: Waiting for September raises the risk that it could fall behind the curve in reacting to changes in job and inflation data, while acting now could suggest Fed officials are seeing something in the economy that investors aren't.\n\n\"A surprise rate cut this week could cause an adverse market reaction and force investors to question why the Fed felt it was necessary to cut rates ahead of expectations,\" said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. He argues that most would conclude that \"the economy and labor market have deteriorated more quickly than expected.\"\n\nRelated: GDP report jolts Fed soft-landing hopes\n\nPowell himself has hinted at the nature of this dilemma. He's told investors that the balance of risks between faster inflation and slowing employment is now more evenly spread, suggesting a path toward a September cut that would still need to be confirmed by incoming data.\n\nBut Richard Ratner, senior vice president at Bel Air Investment Advisors, sees it differently, saying markets will react to the kind of message he delivers in his post-decision news conference.\n\n\"In my view, inflation is no longer the problem. It's growth, and the Fed should be keeping this in mind,\" Ratner said.\n\n\"As for markets, they will be reacting to his comments following the decision,\" he added. \"If [Powell] remains hawkish, markets will likely price out a cut in September and equity markets will sell off as sentiment is hurt.\"\n\nCatchup cuts?\n\nDoty at Sit Investment Associates, however, sees any market pullback from a hawkish Fed message as a buying opportunity, arguing that \"the longer and slower it takes to the Fed to reduce interest rates, the more they will need to do later to 'catch up' as households continue to struggle.\"\n\nRight now, markets seem to be hedging that exact bet: CME Group's FedWatch is now pricing in three rate cuts between now and the end of the year, with the Federal Funds rate falling to 4.625% by the close of the December meeting.\n\nRelated: Former Fed official changes tune on what's next for interest rates\n\nIf the Fed's first cut comes in September, as expected, that would mean the longest stretch between the most recent hike, in July 2023, and the next reduction.\n\nQuickening that pace over the final two meetings of the year would certainly fall into the catchup theory as well, although the Fed isn't the only one changing its recent tune.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\nJune jobs report bolsters bets on an autumn Fed interest rate cutBiden debate flop boosts

Davidson, agreed rates will be held in a range between 5.25% and 5.50% and expects Powell to offer comments suggesting the panel is gaining \"confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\"\n\nThe Fed is risking a policy mistake by waiting to cut rates, according to Ragan. \"There is a fine line between a soft landing and a recession.\"\n\nHe sees a soft landing as real gross domestic product growth settling below the pre-pandemic trend of 2.3%. Should growth fall to into a \"1% to 2% range, how long can it stay there?\" he asks, and does it go up or down from there?\n\nConsumer spending has moderated, with buyers conscious about higher prices, which could diminish companies' ability to raise prices.\n\n\"Slowing but positive spending could evolve into something worse,\" Ragan said. \"We are watching labor statistics for clues, including the weekly jobless claims. Many believe the Fed should pre-emptively cut rates in July.\"\n\nLast week's stronger-than-expected GDP report means the Fed is \"more comfortable waiting for now,\" he said. Also, since the Fed doesn't like to surprise the market, Ragan said, \"the chances of a surprise in July (such as a rate cut) is very low. While the Fed would act quickly if the data changed, that is not the case at this meeting.\"\n\nRagan expects cuts in September, and likely also in November and December. If GDP trends lower, it \"would likely lead to more rate cuts than expected, but this would be a reaction to weak economic data and signify a recession watch,\" he said. \"This remains a risk in our view.\"\n\nWhile data suggest \"inflation is moving in the right direction,\" there are also \"mounting risks that policy rates may be too high, potentially slowing the economy more than intended looking ahead,\" said .\n\n\"We anticipate this will be reflected in the upcoming FOMC meeting. From a real interest rate perspective, the Fed's monetary policy stance has tightened in recent months due to cooling inflation. While the statement will likely receive some form of an upgrade in this direction, we do not consider current labor market conditions weak enough to warrant adjusting policy rates.\"\n\nAs a result, the post-meeting statement may not include the word \"soon,\" Scherrmann said. \"This message will likely be conveyed during this year's Jackson Hole symposium in August, potentially setting the stage for a first rate cut later in the year.\"\n\nConsumer spending and private inventory investment in second quarter GDP suggests economic strength, said Mercatus Center macroeconomist Patrick Horan, and \"that the Fed should avoid cutting its interest rate target prematurely to prevent overstimulation.\"\n\n\"There is not much of a case for a Fed interest rate cut\" at this meeting, he said. Markets have priced in a rate cut in September, Horan said, adding he has \"a hard time seeing a case for more than one cut this year, assuming GDP and inflation continue along recent trends.\"\n\nExpect more of the same as in June, said Tom Clarke, director of investment research at SignatureFD, \"although Chairman [Jerome] Powell may prime the markets more for upcoming rate cuts.\"\n\nThe risk of delayed rate cuts is \"growing,\" he said, with the Fed looking to avoid \"acting prematurely. Therefore, we expect the Fed will most likely keep rates unchanged at the July meeting until they are confident that any rate cut would be sustainable.\"\n\nWhile the labor market is softening, Clarke said, \"it has not deteriorated sharply.\" Additionally, inflation hasn't slowed enough to support a July cut.\n\nThe market is pricing in two or three cuts this year. \"While we believe the likelihood of 2 or 3 cuts over the balance of the year is high, ultimately it is the Fed and not the market that will make the decision,\" he added. Powell called the initial reduction \"consequential,\" which Clarke said means \"the Fed will not want to pause or reverse course once cuts begin.\"\n\nBetween the July and September meetings, he notes, there will be two months of inflation data released. \"As a data-driven body, we expect the Fed will digest all the data it can before acting.\"\n\n\"Our view remains that the Fed will cut only once per quarter in the quarters ahead,\" said Brian Rose, senior U.S. economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. But, if the economy sours, he said, \"the Fed could cut much more aggressively.\"\n\n\"We look for the FOMC to keep its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25%-5.50%,\" said Wells Fargo Securities Chief Economist Jay Bryson, and senior economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese.\n\nNo consensus for a cut at this meeting exists, they said, \"But we think the Committee will signal via its post-meeting statement that a rate cut could come as soon as its next meeting.\"\n\nThe statement \"likely will indicate [the FOMC] has seen more material improvement on inflation in recent months. We also expect the statement to acknowledge the Committee is now attentive to labor market risks as well, rather than focusing solely on inflation risks,\" they said.\n\nThe elections will not impact a potential rate cut, Bryson, House and Pugliese said. \"The historical record shows that political considerations do not seem to enter the FOMC's calculus.\" They see cuts in September and December.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management expects a soft landing and a September start to rate cuts, said Solita Marcelli, its chief investment officer for the Americas. \"Overall, we think markets are underestimating the likely number of Fed cuts over the cycle. Fed officials put their estimate of the longer-run fed funds rate at 2.75% in their latest dot plot projection, compared with around 4% as current market pricing suggests. For investors, this means those holding cash or money market funds need to consider other options for their liquidity, including bond ladders, structured investment strategies with capital preservation features, and a diversified fixed income allocation.\"\n\nBut \"a convincing case\" can be made for a July cut, said Matthew Weller, global head of research at StoneX. \"But after months of setting up September as the start of the rate cutting cycle, there's essentially no chance that Jerome Powell and company jump the gun this month.\"\n\nWith jobless claims on an upward trajectory \"and the potential (likelihood?) that the could trigger by the end of the year, suggest that the balance of risks has shifted to the downside for the labor market,\" he said.\n\nAlso core personal consumption expenditures remains \"incrementally stickier than the Fed would prefer in an ideal world\" and \"real\" after-inflation interest rates are climbing, Weller noted, \"making policy incrementally tighter as the U.S. economy shows signs of downshifting in the second half of the year.\"\n\nThe Fed appears poised to wait \"too long to start cutting interest rates, raising the likelihood that it will have to cut more aggressively to make up for lost ground later this year or in 2025 if the economy continues to slow,\" Weller said.\n\nLast week's data \"was just slightly worse than expected and what the Fed and the market would ideally want,\" said Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed-income at Janus Henderson Investors, but still sets the stage for a September cut and a soft landing.\n\nWilensky expects a \"dovish hold\" at this \"meeting with Powell signaling during the press conference that a first cut is likely to occur 'fairly soon' if the data continues to evolve as they expect.\"\n\nStill, he notes, with lots of data before the following meeting, \"a September cut is far from a certainty. This could drive market volatility, but the bar for the Fed not to cut in September continues to get higher.\"\n\nThis meeting could \"confirm\" a September move, said Subadra Rajappa, Societe Generale head of U.S. rates strategy, \"but not pre-commit to a cadence of cuts thereafter,\" which means the market has overpriced easing.\n\nBut, if inflation doesn't moderate further, she said, \"markets may have to readjust their pricing of the pace of further rate cuts.\"\n\nRajappa expects \"a more calibrated approach than a more traditional rate-cutting cycle.\"\n\nWhile it's \"highly unlikely\" the Fed will cut rates this week, at CIBC Private Wealth U.S., said, \"we expect them to set the stage for a 25 basis point cut in September.\"\n\nHe pointed to core PCE \"on a path toward 2%\" and decelerating employment to support his view. \"It should be easier for Powell to justify reducing the amount of monetary restraint given the current balance of risks,\" Pzegeo said. \"It's possible that the FOMC statement changes at the margin, but the bigger clues are likely to come during Powell's press conference.\"\n\nThe calls a July cut \"unlikely.\"\n\nThe three-month average change in the core PCE price index in June \"consistent with the Fed's 2% target,\" they said. \"If the current trend continues, core inflation will be in line with the Fed's forecast at 2.8% by December 2024 and fall quickly to 2.3% by mid-2025.\"\n\nThey expect Powell to provide \"some forward guidance for a rate cut in September.\" If inflation moderates according to the three-month trend, they said, \"it's possible that the Fed would be able to reduce policy restrictiveness in September. However, if the path proves choppier, a rate cut in the near future is more uncertain.\"\n\nWith unemployment rising, policymakers will see it \"as the labor market coming into better balance,\" rather than signaling \"an imminent recession, as some investors have claimed.\"\n\nThe Fed will continue to focus on inflation, they said, \"unless the unemployment rate begins increasing rapidly (which we are not expecting to happen).\"\n\nThe Fed is in no rush to ease, they said, and will likely just fine tune rates. \"So, market expectations for seven cuts through 2025 are probably too aggressive.\"\n\n\"The Fed might adopt a more dovish tone at this week's meeting, reflecting recent comments and weakness in U.S. data,\" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com.\n\n\"While the disinflation process has been painfully slow, the fact that the unemployment rate has been climbing should start to worry some Fed officials that the current policy is far too restrictive than needed,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed to the unemployment rate, which at 4.1% is above what the Fed expects at yearend, and other data that show a softening jobs market.\n\n\"By holding policy excessively tight while the rest of the world's other major central banks are loosening policy (outside of Japan), the Fed might be causing an unnecessary economic strain, which it will want to avoid given its mismanagement of inflation and interest rates,\" Razaqzada said.\n\nShould the Fed sound dovish, the market could price in three rate cuts this year, up from the approximately 68 basis points of cuts

And the job market has cooled, with the unemployment rate rising about a half-point this year to 4.1%. Fed officials have said that they are seeking to balance the need to keep rates high enough to control inflation without keeping them too high for too long and causing a recession.\n\nRate cuts -- as early as September -- could help the Fed achieve a \"soft landing,\" in which high inflation is defeated without an economic downturn. Such an outcome might also affect this year's presidential race, as Republicans have sought to tie Vice President Kamala Harris to the inflation spike of the past three years. Former President Donald Trump said the Fed shouldn't cut rates before the election.\n\n\"While I don't believe we have reached our final destination, I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted,\" Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said earlier this month.\n\nFinancial market traders have priced in 100% odds that the central bank will reduce its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to futures markets, so Fed Chair Jerome Powell does not need to provide further guidance to markets Wednesday about the timing of a cut, economists say.\n\nInstead, Powell will have more opportunities in the coming months to illustrate how the Fed is thinking about inflation and interest rates, particularly in his speech in late August at the annual Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. As a result, he may not provide much of a hint Wednesday regarding how quickly the Fed will cut rates after it starts doing so. Economists expect relatively gradual cuts, unless there is evidence the job market is faltering, which would spur the Fed to move faster.\n\nEven so, the Fed could alter several parts of the statement it releases after each meeting to lay the groundwork for a cut in September.\n\nIn the statement it released after its June meeting, for example, Fed officials said, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the (Fed's) 2% inflation objective.\" On Wednesday, the Fed could drop \"modest\" or alter it in some other way to underscore that additional progress on inflation has been achieved.\n\nIn the latest piece of good news on price increases, on Friday the government said that yearly inflation fell to 2.5% in July, according to the Fed's preferred inflation measure. That is down from 2.6% the previous month and the lowest since February 2021, when inflation was just starting to accelerate.\n\nOne encouraging sign for the Fed is that rental prices, a key driver of broader inflation, have started to noticeably cool, as new apartment buildings have been completed in many large cities.\n\nRental inflation was a leading example of what economists call \"catch-up\" inflation, in which prices were still rising this year because of distortions from the pandemic economy. Many Americans sought more living space or moved out on their own during COVID, pushing up the cost of rents and homes.\n\nThe government's rental inflation measures have been rising faster than usual, well into this year, to reflect those increases. This even as rapid apartment building has slowed cost increases for new leases. Other examples of \"catch-up\" inflation include car insurance, which soared more than 20% earlier this year from a year ago, as insurance companies have charged more to reflect the pandemic-era spike in new-car prices. Yet, even car insurance costs have started to rise more slowly.\n\nPowell has long said the Fed was seeking \"greater confidence\" that inflation was falling back to the Fed's 2% target. Earlier this month -- even before the latest inflation readings -- he said that recent inflation data does \" add somewhat to confidence \" that it is cooling.\n\nPowell and other Fed officials have also worried that strong job growth and rapidly rising paychecks would potentially fuel inflation, as some companies would likely raise prices to offset the higher labor costs.\n\nBut hiring and wage growth have slowed in recent months, and Powell this month acknowledged the job market is \"not a source of broad inflationary pressures for the economy.\"\n\nOn Friday, the government will release a quarterly measure of wage growth, which is likely to show that paychecks, while still growing at a healthy pace, are not growing as fast as a year ago, adding to evidence that inflationary pressures have eased.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Few economic decisions are of such misplaced importance.\n\nThe Fed has already cut rates, in effect, from its official policy stance of 5.375%. That's what the Fed's communications strategy was designed to accomplish. Chairman Jerome Powell has promised substantial rate cuts in 2024 since late last year. And the U.S. stock market has subsequently increased in value by $12 trillion. Broad financial conditions are considerably easier today than when rates were at zero in March 2022.\n\nThe Fed's other monetary-policy tool -- asset purchases -- is conspicuously absent from the public discussion. It works differently from the conventional interest-rate tool. The Fed's giant, unwieldy financial holdings amount to about $7.3 trillion. That's where the real money is found.\n\nWhen I joined the Fed in 2006, the central bank's assets were about $800 billion, representing around 6% of gross domestic product. The Fed was an important government institution, but the scale of its operations was limited and the scope of its responsibility circumscribed. It did its best work without applause and without the audience at the edge of its seats. The Treasury Department was on the front lines of policymaking, debt funding and bill paying. Congress decided the level and allocation of spending.\n\nThe 2008 financial meltdown and the 2020 pandemic caused a fundamental, persistent and I fear permanent change. When the crises hit, the Fed expanded its power and influence mightily. Interest rates were rightfully cut to zero to lessen the economic hit. But more economic support was required. At the height of the 2008 shock, the Fed created a new monetary-policy instrument, quantitative easing, to cushion the economy and restart financial markets. The Fed bought hundreds of billions of Treasurys and mortgages on the open market for years.\n\nWhen the pandemic struck a decade later, the central bank went even bigger and bolder, buying trillions of new assets, including risky private corporate bonds whose acquisition had never previously been countenanced. In a break from past practice, the Fed also called for massive new fiscal spending. The Biden administration and Congress happily obliged. Conveniently, the Fed bought much of the new outstanding debt issued by the Treasury.\n\nThe Fed, however, has proved a fickle master. At the height of each shock, it promised to unwind its emergency-era policies when the crisis abated. The economy recovered, employment strengthened, and financial markets boomed. But the Fed never quite got around to disposing of most of its added heft. Today, the Fed's holdings equal about 26% of gross domestic product, an order of magnitude larger than 2008.\n\nThe Fed rationalizes its bloated balance sheet as a simple matter of financial management. In another ahistorical decision, its leaders say that monetary policy requires large excess reserves, since, otherwise, lending and credit markets would go astray. The Fed's sway over the stock and bond markets, power over the largest banks, and influence over the dollar are hard to overstate. The Fed is no longer the backstop to the financial system on a dark day. It's the dominant player day in and day out.\n\nThe Fed's policy regime matters, importantly, to the path of inflation. The Fed's asset purchases significantly expanded the money supply. The high priests of central bank dogma might consider it blasphemy, but monetary policy has something to do with money. It's hard to measure money, especially given changes in credit intermediation. And simple rules that track money with inflation are inadequate. But outsize changes in the monetary base and the quantity and velocity of money have an important bearing on the ultimate price level.\n\nThe surge in federal spending and concomitant central-bank asset purchases in 2021 and 2022 contributed to the harmful surge in inflation. The monetary base is up 60% since the pandemic. Another measure of money, M2, is up 36% in the past four years. The inflation surge over the same period -- cumulatively about 22% -- shouldn't have been a surprise. The American people are still paying a high price for the central bank's policy error.\n\nThe Fed shrank its balance sheet in the past few quarters, down 7 percentage points from its peak as a share of GDP. M2 is down about 3%. Lo and behold: less money printing, less inflation.\n\nPrice stability would be more easily achieved if the Fed continues to shrink its holdings. But Fed leaders have strongly signaled the opposite: that its asset holdings are approaching steady state. They argue that the fall in inflation can be traced to lower wage increases in a softer job market. In my view, irresponsible government spending and excessive money printing are largely to blame for triggering inflation in the first place.\n\nHad the Fed recognized the inflation problem sooner, it wouldn't have been forced to raise rates so high. Had the Fed's asset holdings stayed smaller or shrunk faster, inflation wouldn't have risen so high. Hardworking Americans wouldn't now be suffering the twin indignities of high prices and higher credit costs.\n\nA dollar four years ago can buy less than 80 cents of goods and services today. But a dollar in the stock market is worth about $1.80. Much of Wall Street applauds the Fed's big balance sheet and monetary dominance in Washington. Households and businesses on Main Street have far less reason for enthusiasm.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HM Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Excess reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2024/07/29/600x338/im-38396491_1722226443429_1722226618900.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The probability is only 4.1% for a rate reduction at this week's Fed meeting.\n\nFutures signal a 98.3% chance of at least two rate cuts by December, with a 65.3% probability of at least three decreases.\n\nThe question: Should the Fed cut rates now?\n\nSome contrarian voices on what the Fed should and will do are out there.\n\nFormer New York Fed President Bill Dudley had thought for some time that the Fed should leave rates higher for longer. But he has changed his tune and says the central bank should act this week. \"The facts have changed,\" he wrote on Bloomberg.\n\nLooking back, \"for years, the persistent strength of the U.S. economy suggested that the Fed wasn't doing enough to slow things down,\" Dudley said. But the central bank boosted rates 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023.\n\nRelated: With Fed set to cut rates, this money move may pay off\n\n\"Now, the Fed's efforts to cool the economy are having a visible effect,\" he said. Consumption, housing and hiring are slowing. The unemployment rate registered 4.1% in June, up from 3.7% in December.\n\nCombine all that with slowing inflation and you get Dudley's call for a rate decrease now. Consumer-price inflation slid to 3% in June from 3.3% in May.\n\n\"Although it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk,\" he said.\n\nThe views of Vanguard and Goldman Sachs\n\nVanguard economists see it differently. They predict no Fed action through year-end.\n\n\"Continued economic growth, labor momentum, and stubborn inflation are likely to leave the Fed without the confidence it needs to cut interest rates this year,\" they wrote in a commentary.\n\nRelated: Vanguard offers unexpected Fed interest rate forecast\n\nBut that's not a slam dunk, they said. \"Continued favorable inflation readings would likely allow for a rate cut, with September as the most likely timing,\" they explained.\n\n\"Still, we believe it would be difficult for the Fed to cut its policy rate more than once in 2024. We assign a low probability to inflation reaccelerating enough to warrant a further rate increase.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon, meanwhile, is more dovish. Two months ago he forecast no rate cuts for this year. He now sees things differently.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\nJune jobs report bolsters bets on an autumn Fed interest rate cutBiden debate flop boosts Trump, but economy may be tougher opponentFirst-half market gains come with a dash of investor unease\n\n\"One or two cuts in the fall seems more likely,\" he told CNBC. \"There's no question there are some shifts in consumer behavior. And the cumulative impact of what's been kind of a long inflationary pressure, even though it's moderating, is having an effect on consumer habits.\"\n\nConsumer spending rose 0.2% inflation-adjusted in June.\n\nThe official projection from Goldman Sachs economists calls for a rate cut in September and then another in the fourth quarter.\n\nInterest rates have a strong impact on consumers and investors, of course. Lower rates mean less income from your bonds, money-market funds and bank accounts. But they also mean lower payments on your mortgage, auto and credit-card loans.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_weil@postandcourier.com", "name": "Dan Weil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Dudley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Dudley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Vanguard Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Global_Management", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo Global Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Annual inflation dipped in June to 3.0 %: far below the two-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, but still above the Fed's 2% goal.\n\nMost economists expect only hints of future Fed actions from the panel today, when its two-day policy meeting ends. They believe that inflation is trending in the right direction, and that two more months of cooler inflation reports will give the Fed room to ease rates.\n\nInterest rate cuts on the horizon? Will the Fed cut rates this week?

Today we'll explore those questions. Let's first start off with what we know.\n\nWe know that tomorrow, the Fed will leave its target rate unchanged. That decision will keep the federal funds target at 5.50%. Why am I so confident about saying that?\n\nOver the course of 19 FOMC meetings beginning March 16, 2022, I've been correct in all of my forecasts, including the policy rate pause that began in September 2023. I'm confident I'll be correct tomorrow also.\n\nIn addition, I expect the Fed will do nothing to contradict prior indications that the rate hike cycle that began in March 2022 is over. In effect, the Fed has concluded that they have reached the terminal rate. That's the rate at which inflation is expected to come down on its own without further rate hikes.\n\nNo Dots\n\nIn the Fed's view, the lagged effect of prior interest rate hikes will do the job of lowering inflation to the Fed's target of 2.0%. No further action is required. It's just a matter of time and patience.\n\nThis FOMC announcement tomorrow will not include an updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), known as the \"dots.\" These are forecasts of interest rates, unemployment and economic growth offered by members of the Board of Governors of the Fed and regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents.\n\nThe dots have been wildly inaccurate in the past. While the dots are technically unimportant and usually wrong, they're played up in the media. It's a relief that there will be no dots from this meeting for the media to chew over. There will be a press conference by Fed Chair Jay Powell after the meeting.\n\nInflation Still Has the Fed Sitting Tight\n\nThe reason for the Fed not cutting rates (the infamous \"pivot\" that Wall Street has been wrong about for two years) is that the Fed is losing the battle against inflation.\n\nWhen inflation (measured monthly by CPI on a year-over-year basis) dropped from 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.0% in June 2023, the Fed was ready to declare victory. Its goal was still 2.0% annualized inflation, but progress from 9.1% to 3.0% was so dramatic that 2.0% seemed well within reach. It was around that time (July 2023) that the Fed hit the pause button on further rate hikes.\n\nSince then, the inflation news has been consistently bad for the Fed.\n\nHere's the tale of the inflation tape using the Consumer Price Index on a year-over year basis:\n\nDateCPI (year-over-year)June 20233.0%July 20233.2%August 20233.7%September 20233.7%October 20233.2%November 20233.1%December 20233.4%January 20243.1%February 20243.2%March 20243.5%April 20243.4%May 20243.3%June 20243.0%No Sign Inflation's Going Away\n\nSeveral facts jump out immediately from this most recent 13-month time series. The first is that inflation isn't going down in a convincing way.It's true that inflation dropped from 3.3% in May to 3.0% in June. But the June 2024 3.0% reading is identical to the June 2023 3.0% reading.\n\nIn other words, inflation hasn't moved at all in over a year.\n\nInflation has bounced around somewhat over the past 13 months, including spikes to 3.7% in August and September 2023. Still, inflation hasn't budged materially from the 3.1% level reached in January 2024.\n\nThe best that can be said is that inflation is in a range of 3.0-3.7% with a central tendency of about 3.3%. It's been stuck in that range for over one year and is not trending toward the Fed's stated goal of 2.0%.\n\nImportantly, even if the drop from 3.3% in May to 3.0% in June is the beginning of a sustainable downward trend (that's not yet clear), it'll take at least two more months of positive data to convince the Fed that this is a trend and not just another monthly gyration.\n\nThat takes a July rate cut off the table and probably September too.\n\n\"Outliers\"\n\nFor purposes of analyzing inflation, I use the headline CPI number. The reason is simple -- that's the number that everyday Americans actually pay at the grocery store and the gas pump, so it's the best number for understanding behavioral responses, changes in expectations and political implications.\n\nThe eggheads at the Fed and Wall Street have devised \"core CPI\" (excluding food and energy), \"super-core CPI\" (excluding food, energy and housing), \"core PCE\" (a completely different index that the Fed prefers that also excludes food and energy), \"trimmed-mean CPI\" (this measure disregards the highest and lowest figures as \"outliers\") and so on.\n\nThese measures are devised by economists who must not have enough to do. I understand them all, but I also understand that they're abstractions that don't sync up with what people actually pay. Show me someone who doesn't spend money on food, gas, home heating and rent and maybe I'll pay attention, but not sooner.\n\nThat said, when the Fed claims to be data dependent, they rely on more than just the unemployment rate and CPI. Here's a summary of recent data, some supporting a rate cut by the Fed and some suggesting the Fed will do nothing...\n\nThe unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1% in the June employment report. Oil prices have trended down from $86.90 to $75.50 over recent weeks. Consumer savings are largely depleted and credit cards are maxed out.\n\nHigher rates for credit cards are headwinds to consumption. Higher rates for mortgages are a headwind to home purchases and consumer durables. Inverted yield curve continues to signal a coming recession. Most job creation is in part-time jobs. Jobs are going largely to illegal aliens\n\nData Supporting No Rate Cut\n\nThe Atlanta Fed GDP nowcast for Q3 24 = 2.8%. Second-quarter GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.8%. Job creation remains solid, up by 206,000 jobs in the June employment report. Labor force participation moved up to 62.6% from 62.5% in the May employment report. The unemployment rate remains historically low (4.1%) despite recent increases.Regular gas at the pump has trended up from $3.49 per gallon to $3.51 per gallon in the past month.\n\nThese data aren't given equal weighting by the Fed. The inflation rate is the dominant factor in a world where job growth remains strong.\n\nGiven a mixed bag of data and continuing inflation above targets, the Fed will simply do nothing. Waiting another month or two for more data is what this Fed does best. They're in no hurry to do anything right now.\n\nWe'll learn more during Jay Powell's press conference on the Fed's future plans. At this point, it's clear the Fed won't cut rates at this week's meeting and is unlikely to cut rates at the Sept. 18 meeting. Even if inflation cools off next month, the Fed won't be prepared to pivot to rate cuts that quickly.\n\nA September Rate Cut? Not So Fast\n\nAnother powerful factor likely to negate a rate cut at the September meeting is the proximity of that meeting to the Nov. 5 presidential election. Any rate cut in September will be viewed as political interference by the Republicans and could jeopardize Fed independence if Trump wins the election, which seems likely at this stage.\n\nThe Fed would prefer to keep their heads down and avoid a firestorm. There will be ample time in November and December to cut rates after the election.\n\nMarket commentators point to the fact that the CME fed funds futures contract now assigns a 100% chance to a rate cut in September. My rejoinder is that the predictive analytic value of this futures contract on actual Fed policy is zero.\n\nThis contract taken on a three-month forward basis for the past three years has always been wrong. The contract is nothing more than a reflection of the Wall Street \"soft landing\" and \"pivot\" narratives that have been wrong since late 2022.\n\nIt looks like they're wrong again.", "source": {"uri": "dailyreckoning.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Reckoning"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rickards@dailyreckoning.com", "name": "James Rickards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Powell_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Powell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outlier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_yield_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inverted yield curve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://dailyreckoning.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dr-hero-img-07-30-24-shutterstock_2465830653.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 6708, "textEnd": 6716}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 6981, "textEnd": 6987}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-03-", "textStart": 556, "textEnd": 564}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

That was down from 3.4% in May and 3.6% in April.\n\nSome Fed watchers do argue the Fed has the basis to support a cut at its meeting this week, even as they note they don't expect it to happen.\n\n\"I don't see a reason within the economic data that they should not cut this meeting,\" said Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley. \"In fact, I think it's hard to see a reason that they should keep rates where they are.\"\n\nThat said, there's \"no way\" the Fed would do that, Tilley added, because it runs the risk of \"spooking the markets.\"\n\nHe predicts one cut in September and another in December, followed by a total of six quarter-point cuts in 2025.\n\nThe last median estimate from the 19 Fed officials who have a voice in the direction of rates was for one rate cut this year, a prediction made in early June.\n\nBut that was likely influenced by hotter-than-expected inflation data in the first quarter. Now that inflation is cooling again, officials may be more open to two cuts before 2024 is over.\n\nThe Fed will announce its policy decision Wednesday at 2 pm ET, followed by Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 pm ET.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Its favored measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labor market has come into better balance.\n\nDespite the improved economic picture, the Fed is not expected to make its first rate cut at the conclusion of a two-day policymakers' meeting on Wednesday, High Frequency Economics (HFE) chief US economist Rubeela Farooqi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nRecent comments from Fed officials \"suggest that they will remain on hold at their meeting... but have moved closer to a first interest rate cut,\" Goldman Sachs US chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published Friday.\n\nInstead, the Fed's rate-setting committee \"is likely to revise its statement to hint that a cut at the following meeting in September has become more likely,\" he said.\n\n- Waiting for September -\n\nThe Fed has lifted its benchmark lending rate to a range between 5.25 and 5.50 percent\n\nAt the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.\n\nSince then, the data has painted a much better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 65 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.\n\nThose cuts are expected to come in the form of three quarter-point moves.\n\nThe markets now overwhelmingly expect the Fed's first move to come in September, and have assigned a chance of less than five percent that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will move on Wednesday.\n\n\"The case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is strong and we anticipate that it will use the July meeting to plant the seed that the first move in the normalization cycle is on the table for September,\" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\n- 'Modest further progress' -\n\nA September cut would thrust the Fed into the middle of the 2024 presidential election campaign\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in Washington earlier this month that recent data \"have shown some modest further progress\" against inflation.\n\n\"More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent,\" he added.\n\nPowell is unlikely \"to broadcast an exact date for when the FOMC may start lowering rates\" when he speaks to reporters later on Wednesday, Farooqi from HFE said.\n\n\"But he will probably acknowledge that inflation is moving in the right direction, and the FOMC is moving closer to gaining sufficient confidence to make the policy stance less restrictive,\" she added.\n\nPowell will have further opportunities over the summer to make the Fed's position clear -- including his keynote address to a gathering of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next month.\n\n\"We believe Powell will wait until Jackson Hole end August -- by which time the Fed will have another month's data -- to deliver the explicit September cut signal,\" economists at Evercore ISI wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nIf the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

The probability is only 4.1% for a rate reduction at this week's Fed meeting.\n\nFutures signal a 98.3% chance of at least two rate cuts by December, with a 65.3% probability of at least three decreases.\n\nThe question: Should the Fed cut rates now?\n\nSome contrarian voices on what the Fed should and will do are out there.\n\nFormer New York Fed President Bill Dudley had thought for some time that the Fed should leave rates higher for longer. But he has changed his tune and says the central bank should act this week. \"The facts have changed,\" he wrote on Bloomberg.\n\nLooking back, \"for years, the persistent strength of the U.S. economy suggested that the Fed wasn't doing enough to slow things down,\" Dudley said. But the central bank boosted rates 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023.\n\n\"Now, the Fed's efforts to cool the economy are having a visible effect,\" he said. Consumption, housing and hiring are slowing. The unemployment rate registered 4.1% in June, up from 3.7% in December.\n\nCombine all that with slowing inflation and you get Dudley's call for a rate decrease now. Consumer-price inflation slid to 3% in June from 3.3% in May.\n\n\"Although it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk,\" he said.\n\nThe views of Vanguard and Goldman Sachs\n\nVanguard economists see it differently. They predict no Fed action through year-end.\n\n\"Continued economic growth, labor momentum, and stubborn inflation are likely to leave the Fed without the confidence it needs to cut interest rates this year,\" they wrote in a commentary.\n\nBut that's not a slam dunk, they said. \"Continued favorable inflation readings would likely allow for a rate cut, with September as the most likely timing,\" they explained.\n\n\"Still, we believe it would be difficult for the Fed to cut its policy rate more than once in 2024. We assign a low probability to inflation reaccelerating enough to warrant a further rate increase.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon, meanwhile, is more dovish. Two months ago he forecast no rate cuts for this year. He now sees things differently.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\n\"One or two cuts in the fall seems more likely,\" he told CNBC. \"There's no question there are some shifts in consumer behavior. And the cumulative impact of what's been kind of a long inflationary pressure, even though it's moderating, is having an effect on consumer habits.\"\n\nConsumer spending rose 0.2% inflation-adjusted in June.\n\nThe official projection from Goldman Sachs economists calls for a rate cut in September and then another in the fourth quarter.\n\nInterest rates have a strong impact on consumers and investors, of course. Lower rates mean less income from your bonds, money-market funds and bank accounts. But they also mean lower payments on your mortgage, auto and credit-card loans.", "source": {"uri": "thestreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheStreet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_weil@thestreet.com", "name": "Dan Weil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Dudley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Dudley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Global_Management", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo Global Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Vanguard Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjAwMzA1OTg5MzkwNDQzNjI4/pivot-mia---day-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Economists and traders widely expect Fed officials to cut their policy rate at their next meeting, in September. Wall Street will closely watch for any hints about the future in both the Fed's statement at 2 p.m. and a subsequent news conference with Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the central bank.\n\nWhile few economists expect an explicit signal on when a rate reduction is coming -- the Fed has been trying to keep its options open -- many think that central bankers will at least leave the door open to a cut at the next meeting, which will wrap up on Sept. 18. And Mr. Powell is sure to face questions about how officials are thinking about the potential for moves after that. Here's what to look out for.\n\nWatch the Fed's statement for changes.\n\nThe Fed's statement, a slowly changing document that officials release after each two-day meeting, currently states that Fed policymakers expect to hold rates steady until they have \"gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably\" down.\n\nMichael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, wrote in his preview note that the statement could be headed for a small but meaningful tweak: Officials could adjust \"greater confidence\" to read \"further confidence,\" or some similar rewording. That would signal that policymakers were becoming more comfortable with the inflation backdrop.\n\nThere would be a reason for that growing confidence. After proving surprisingly stubborn early in 2024, inflation is cooling again. The latest report showed that the Fed's preferred index picked up just 2.5 percent over the year through June -- still quicker than the central bank's 2 percent target, but much slower than that measure's recent peak in 2022, which was above 7 percent.\n\nWhile the Fed releases economic projections once a quarter to show how officials expect inflation and rates to shape up, this is not a meeting with those forecasts. The next set will come in September.\n\nThat will leave investors reliant on the statement and Mr. Powell's news conference as they try to understand the Fed's path ahead.\n\nThe Fed chair could give hints about the outlook.\n\nMany economists predict that Mr. Powell is likely to avoid committing the Fed to anything concrete, even though market pricing has coalesced around a rate move in September. Some investors are even betting on a large cut of half a percentage point, rather than the standard quarter point.\n\n\"The market might be disappointed if it's expecting that Powell will commit to a cut in September,\" said Oscar Munoz, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities. \"They're almost there -- but they want to see a few more data releases.\"\n\nMr. Munoz said the only reason the Fed would make a big reduction in September would be if the labor market took a sudden and unexpected turn for the worse.\n\nRate-cut timing hinges on incoming data.\n\nTo that point, when and how much the Fed cuts this year are likely to hinge on two sets of incoming data: what happens next with inflation and what happens next with the job market.\n\nWhen it comes to inflation, some economists think that it would take only a little bit more evidence of progress on the two main measures -- the Consumer Price Index and Personal Consumption Expenditures index -- to push the Fed toward a rate move.\n\n\"We suspect that an acceptable July C.P.I. report would likely be enough to clinch a September cut,\" economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in their note previewing the Fed meeting.\n\nBut Fed officials have been clear that they are also paying close attention to what is happening in the job market. If conditions sour, that may add to their urgency in cutting rates. Policymakers will receive two fresh jobs reports before their September meeting, with the July numbers coming on Friday.\n\n\"They don't want to take the strength of the labor market for granted,\" said Karen Dynan, a Harvard professor and former Treasury chief economist during the Obama administration.\n\nAnother big question: How fast will rates come down?\n\nBoth the labor market and inflation data are likely to inform how fast rates fall over the next few years. While the first cut is in focus at the moment, investors are also beginning to wonder what will come after it.\n\nAs of their June economic projections, Fed forecasts implied that central bankers could cut roughly every other meeting once they got started. That would lower rates to 4.1 percent by the end of next year and 3.1 percent by the end of 2026.\n\nWhether that anticipated pace turns out to be the case \"will likely depend mainly on the labor market, which has sent mixed signals lately,\" and on government taxing and spending policy after the presidential election in November, Goldman Sachs economists wrote in their preview note. Hotter economic conditions would slow the Fed's cuts down, while a more pronounced cooling could speed them up.\n\nMr. Powell could face questions about how the Fed is thinking about pacing after an initial move at his news conference this week. So far, officials have been more focused on explaining what it would take for them to begin lowering borrowing costs in the first place.\n\n\"They know that the first cut will be important -- it will signal the start of an easing cycle,\" Mr. Munoz of TD Securities said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeanna_smialek@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeanna Smialek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Such an outcome might also affect this year's presidential race, as Republicans have sought to tie Vice President Kamala Harris to the inflation spike of the past three years. Former President Donald Trump said the Fed shouldn't cut rates before the election.\n\n\"While I don't believe we have reached our final destination, I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted,\" Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said earlier this month.\n\nFinancial market traders have priced in 100% odds that the central bank will reduce its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to futures markets, so Fed Chair Jerome Powell does not need to provide further guidance to markets Wednesday about the timing of a cut, economists say.\n\nInstead, Powell will have more opportunities in the coming months to illustrate how the Fed is thinking about inflation and interest rates, particularly in his speech in late August at the annual Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. As a result, he may not provide much of a hint Wednesday regarding how quickly the Fed will cut rates after it starts doing so. Economists expect relatively gradual cuts, unless there is evidence the job market is faltering, which would spur the Fed to move faster.\n\nEven so, the Fed could alter several parts of the statement it releases after each meeting to lay the groundwork for a cut in September.\n\nIn the statement it released after its June meeting, for example, Fed officials said, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the (Fed's) 2% inflation objective.\" On Wednesday, the Fed could drop \"modest\" or alter it in some other way to underscore that additional progress on inflation has been achieved.\n\nIn the latest piece of good news on price increases, on Friday the government said that yearly inflation fell to 2.5% in July, according to the Fed's preferred inflation measure. That is down from 2.6% the previous month and the lowest since February 2021, when inflation was just starting to accelerate.\n\nOne encouraging sign for the Fed is that rental prices, a key driver of broader inflation, have started to noticeably cool, as new apartment buildings have been completed in many large cities.\n\nRental inflation was a leading example of what economists call \"catch-up\" inflation, in which prices were still rising this year because of distortions from the pandemic economy. Many Americans sought more living space or moved out on their own during COVID, pushing up the cost of rents and homes.\n\nThe government's rental inflation measures have been rising faster than usual, well into this year, to reflect those increases. This even as rapid apartment building has slowed cost increases for new leases. Other examples of \"catch-up\" inflation include car insurance, which soared more than 20% earlier this year from a year ago, as insurance companies have charged more to reflect the pandemic-era spike in new-car prices. Yet, even car insurance costs have started to rise more slowly.\n\nPowell has long said the Fed was seeking \"greater confidence\" that inflation was falling back to the Fed's 2% target. Earlier this month -- even before the latest inflation readings -- he said that recent inflation data does \" add somewhat to confidence \" that it is cooling.\n\nPowell and other Fed officials have also worried that strong job growth and rapidly rising paychecks would potentially fuel inflation, as some companies would likely raise prices to offset the higher labor costs.\n\nBut hiring and wage growth have slowed in recent months, and Powell this month acknowledged the job market is \"not a source of broad inflationary pressures for the economy.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson Hole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/EQKZ7KAe0OLaW99WEL5CObcGdT0=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/3FDHCKRZADZTKVGLYK5QQLYDTY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 759, "textEnd": 770}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

They're not astrophysicists and don't understand the first thing about rocket propulsion, and most of the journalists never bothered to learn even the basics of the topic.\n\nSo, the majority of the questions were very superficial; quite simply the reporters didn't want to embarrass themselves.\n\nThis is how the media covers the Federal Reserve. Most reporters don't have a clue about central banking, so, not wanting to look stupid, they just sit quietly and give the Fed a pass. There's no real scrutiny.\n\nAt the same time, Fed officials are generally in lockstep with one another; it's not like politics where the two sides constantly chastise one another. With the Fed, there is virtually no public dissent.\n\nEven former Fed officials who have long left the bank maintain an almost mafioso code of silence.\n\nThe end result is that no one really criticizes the Fed. And because of this, the Fed has been able to cultivate a reputation that they're in total control of the situation... even though their track record proves the opposite.\n\nThe Fed completely failed to predict inflation in 2020 after engaging in record money printing. Then they missed the warning signs in early 2021, then misdiagnosed inflation as \"transitory\" in late 2021, then still failed to act until early 2022.\n\nYet despite such failures, the Fed is still sticking to the narrative that they know what they're doing. And with hardly anyone challenging them, it's been easy to maintain a veneer of omnipotence.\n\nBut Kevin Warsh broke ranks this weekend. As a former Fed governor, he is the ultimate insider... and he penned an editorial published in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday blasting many of the Fed's decisions.\n\nWarsh describes how, when he joined the central bank in 2006, its entire balance sheet was just $800 billion. But in order to deal with the 2008 financial shock (yet another crisis that the Fed missed), they invented \"quantitative easing\", or QE.\n\nQE was just a fancy way to say they were conjuring massive amounts of money out of thin air. Informally we could say they were 'printing money', though almost all of the new money was created in digital rather than paper form. They click a few buttons, and, poof, new money.\n\nNaturally the Fed promised to eventually unwind QE and drain all of that new money out of the financial system. But they never did.\n\nOn the contrary, the Fed embarked on THREE distinct rounds of QE between 2008 and 2013, increasing the balance sheet each time. In the end, the Fed's balance sheet peaked at $4.5 TRILLION, more than 5x its size prior to the 2008 crisis.\n\nAnd they kept it at that level for years. Even by 2020, the Fed balance sheet was still around $4 trillion in size.\n\nSo much for unwinding. And when the pandemic hit, the Fed quickly pulled out its QE playbook and embarked on a fourth round of money printing... exploding the balance sheet all the way to NINE TRILLION dollars.\n\nWarsh eviscerates the Fed policymakers for failing to see such obvious consequences and explains that there is a very clear connection between the size of the Fed's balance sheet, i.e. the amount of money it prints, and inflation.\n\n\"The monetary base is up 60% since the pandemic. Another measure of money, M2, is up 36% in the past four years. The inflation surge in the same period- cumulatively about 22%- shouldn't have been a surprise.\"\n\n\"The high priests of central bank dogma might consider it blasphemy,\" he writes, but \"less money printing, less inflation.\" Duh.\n\nHe goes on to say, \"The American people are still paying a high price for the central bank's policy error,\" and that if the Fed really wants to tame inflation, they're going to have to slash their balance sheet, i.e. unwind most of the new money that they printed.\n\nFat chance.\n\nIn fact, Warsh points out that the Fed has already indicated they will NOT reduce the size of their balance sheet any longer. And Peter and I both believe the Fed will soon embark on even more QE.\n\nWhy? Because the federal government has a serious spending problem. Even the government's own budget forecasts show an additional $22 trillion in deficit spending over the next decade.\n\nAnd where will the bulk of that money come from? Most likely from the Fed. They'll launch QE5, QE6, and beyond, to print the trillions and trillions of dollars that the US government will need to make ends meet in the coming decade.\n\nSure, it's possible that the government gets real... that they cut spending, eliminate some entitlements, slash regulations, abandon idiotic green initiatives, and stop standing in the way of conventional energy.\n\nBut the window of opportunity is extremely narrow... and depends on the election this year. Plus, a lot of things will have to go right, and very little can go wrong.\n\nSo, it's reasonable to anticipate more deficit spending, which means more Fed printing. And more inflation.", "source": {"uri": "schiffsovereign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Schiff Sovereign"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hickman@schiffsovereign.com", "name": "James Hickman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warsh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sicilian Mafia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u20132023_inflation_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021\u20132023 inflation surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blasphemy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subprime mortgage crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dogma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deficit spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Printing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Printing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://schiffsov.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DALL\u00b7E-2024-07-29-13.56.20-A-highly-realistic-image-representing-the-concept-of-quantitative-easing-and-money-printing.-Show-a-detailed-printing-press-machine-actively-producing.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Its favored measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labor market has come into better balance.\n\nDespite the improved economic picture, the Fed is not expected to make its first rate cut on Wednesday, High Frequency Economics (HFE) chief US economist Rubeela Farooqi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nRecent comments from Fed officials \"suggest that they will remain on hold at their meeting,\" Goldman Sachs US chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published Friday, adding that they \"have moved closer to a first interest rate cut.\"\n\nInstead, the Fed's rate-setting committee \"is likely to revise its statement to hint that a cut at the following meeting in September has become more likely,\" he said.\n\n- Waiting for September -\n\nAt the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.\n\nSince then, the data has painted a much better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 65 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.\n\nThose cuts are expected to come in the form of three separate quarter-point moves.\n\nThe markets now overwhelmingly expect the Fed's first move to come in September, and have assigned a chance of less than five percent that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will move on Wednesday.\n\n\"The case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is strong and we anticipate that it will use the July meeting to plant the seed that the first move in the normalization cycle is on the table for September,\" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\n- 'Modest further progress' -\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in Washington earlier this month that recent data \"have shown some modest further progress\" against inflation.\n\n\"More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent,\" he added.\n\nPowell is unlikely \"to broadcast an exact date for when the FOMC may start lowering rates\" when he speaks to reporters later on Wednesday, Farooqi from HFE said.\n\n\"But he will probably acknowledge that inflation is moving in the right direction, and the FOMC is moving closer to gaining sufficient confidence to make the policy stance less restrictive,\" she added.\n\nPowell will have further opportunities over the summer to make the Fed's position clear -- including his keynote address to a gathering of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next month.\n\n\"We believe Powell will wait until Jackson Hole end August -- by which time the Fed will have another month's data -- to deliver the explicit September cut signal,\" economists at Evercore ISI wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nIf the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.\n\nda/nro", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFXG FOX54"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wfxg.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/c9/2c962e0b-d228-555e-9727-5be53515e698/66a9babbd206d.image.jpg?crop=341%2C341%2C85%2C0&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The probability is only 4.1% for a rate reduction at this week's Fed meeting.\n\nFutures signal a 98.3% chance of at least two rate cuts by December, with a 65.3% probability of at least three decreases.\n\nSome contrarian voices on what the Fed should and will do are out there.\n\nFormer New York Fed President Bill Dudley had thought for some time that the Fed should leave rates higher for longer. But he has changed his tune and says the central bank should act this week. \"The facts have changed,\" he wrote on Bloomberg.\n\nLooking back, \"for years, the persistent strength of the U.S. economy suggested that the Fed wasn't doing enough to slow things down,\" Dudley said. But the central bank boosted rates 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023.\n\nRelated: With Fed set to cut rates, this money move may pay off\n\n\"Now, the Fed's efforts to cool the economy are having a visible effect,\" he said. Consumption, housing and hiring are slowing. The unemployment rate registered 4.1% in June, up from 3.7% in December.\n\nCombine all that with slowing inflation and you get Dudley's call for a rate decrease now. Consumer-price inflation slid to 3% in June from 3.3% in May.\n\n\"Although it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk,\" he said.\n\nVanguard economists see it differently. They predict no Fed action through year-end.\n\n\"Continued economic growth, labor momentum, and stubborn inflation are likely to leave the Fed without the confidence it needs to cut interest rates this year,\" they wrote in a commentary.\n\nRelated: Vanguard offers unexpected Fed interest rate forecast\n\nBut that's not a slam dunk, they said. \"Continued favorable inflation readings would likely allow for a rate cut, with September as the most likely timing,\" they explained.\n\n\"Still, we believe it would be difficult for the Fed to cut its policy rate more than once in 2024. We assign a low probability to inflation reaccelerating enough to warrant a further rate increase.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon, meanwhile, is more dovish. Two months ago he forecast no rate cuts for this year. He now sees things differently.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\n\"One or two cuts in the fall seems more likely,\" he told CNBC. \"There's no question there are some shifts in consumer behavior. And the cumulative impact of what's been kind of a long inflationary pressure, even though it's moderating, is having an effect on consumer habits.\"\n\nConsumer spending rose 0.2% inflation-adjusted in June.\n\nThe official projection from Goldman Sachs economists calls for a rate cut in September and then another in the fourth quarter.\n\nInterest rates have a strong impact on consumers and investors, of course. Lower rates mean less income from your bonds, money-market funds and bank accounts. But they also mean lower payments on your mortgage, auto and credit-card loans.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The question will soon be, how fast?", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Two years after launching an aggressive fight against inflation and one year after leaving its benchmark interest rate at a near-quarter-century high, the Federal Reserve is expected to signal July 31 that it will likely reduce borrowing costs as soon as September.\n\nA rate reduction this fall -- the first since the pandemic -- would amount to a momentous shift and a potential boost to the economy. Fed rate cuts, over time, typically lower borrowing costs for such things as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\n\nA single cut in the key rate, now at roughly 5.3 percent, wouldn't by itself make much difference to the economy. Financial markets widely expect it. Some borrowing costs have already dropped slightly in anticipation of the move. As a result, the main question for the central bank will be: How fast and how far will the policymakers ultimately lower borrowing costs?\n\nIt's a question of keen interest to both major presidential candidates, too. Any signal that the Fed will rapidly cut rates could boost the economy and potentially lift Vice President Kamala Harris' election prospects. Former President Donald Trump has argued that the Fed shouldn't cut rates until its next meeting, in November, which will come two days after the election.\n\nFutures markets have priced in a 64 percent likelihood that the central bank will cut rates three times this year, in September, November and December, according to CME FedWatch. As recently as last month, Fed officials had collectively forecast just one rate reduction in 2024 and four in 2025 and 2026, suggesting that they lean toward a more measured pace of cutting rates about once a quarter.\n\nHow the economy fares in the coming months will likely determine how quickly the Fed acts. Should growth remain solid and employers keep hiring, the Fed would prefer to take its time and cut rates slowly as inflation continues to decline.\n\n\"They want to be very gradual in how they pull back,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. \"But if the labor market actually looks like it's slowing down,\" Goldberg suggested, Fed officials might conclude that \"they should be moving a little bit quicker than they otherwise would.\"\n\nThere are signs that the labor market is cooling, as the Fed has intended. Job growth has averaged a decent but unspectacular 177,000 a month for the past three months, down from a red-hot three-month average of 275,000 a year ago.\n\nIt's not yet clear whether that cooling reflects a return of the economy to a more sustainable, less inflationary, post-pandemic period of growth or whether the cooling will continue until the economy slides into a recession.\n\n\"That's the million-dollar question at this point,\" Goldberg said.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nSC lake hasn't allowed fishing since the 1950s.

That shift in emphasis toward ensuring that the job market doesn't weaken too much has likely boosted market expectations for a rate cut.\n\n\"Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,\" Powell said in congressional testimony earlier this month, after the most recent jobs report showed the unemployment rate ticking up for a third straight month to a still-low 4.1%. Yet Powell also characterized the job market and growth at that time as \"strong.\"\n\nAnd on Thursday the government reported that the economy grew at a healthy 2.8 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, though that figure followed a tepid 1.4 percent expansion in the first three months of the year.\n\n\"The economy looks pretty solid at the moment,\" said William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer. \"I don't think there are real signs now that something bad is going to happen.\"\n\nEnglish, like many other observers, thinks Powell will provide a clearer picture of future rate moves at his annual speech in August during the Fed's monetary policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This week, though, the Fed may change the statement it issues after each meeting in ways that could hint that a rate cut is coming soon.\n\nFor example, the statement it released after its June meeting had read, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the (Fed's) 2 percent inflation objective.\" When it issues its new statement Wednesday afternoon, the Fed could drop \"modest\" or alter it in some other way to underscore that additional progress on inflation has been achieved.\n\nIn June, the Fed's policymakers had forecast that year-over-year inflation would average 2.8 percent in the final three months of this year. On Friday, the government said that inflation has already fallen below that level, to 2.5 percent in June, according to the Fed's preferred measure.\n\nIf inflation remains below the Fed's year-end target, that could justify cutting borrowing rates more than the single reduction the policymakers forecast in June.\n\nStill, even as price pressures cool, annual inflation may not fall much more this year -- and could even rise a bit by the end of 2024. That's because monthly inflation readings fell to very low levels in the second half of last year. So even low monthly figures in the coming months might not pull down year-over-year inflation.\n\nFed officials, though, are expected to focus much more on the three-month and six-month annualized inflation averages in the coming months. The three-month average of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, fell to just 2.3 percent in June.\n\nSign up for our business newsletter.

Its favored measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labor market has come into better balance.\n\nDespite the improved economic picture, the Fed is not expected to make its first rate cut at the conclusion of a two-day policymakers' meeting on Wednesday, High Frequency Economics (HFE) chief US economist Rubeela Farooqi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nRecent comments from Fed officials \"suggest that they will remain on hold at their meeting... but have moved closer to a first interest rate cut,\" Goldman Sachs US chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published Friday.\n\nInstead, the Fed's rate-setting committee \"is likely to revise its statement to hint that a cut at the following meeting in September has become more likely,\" he said.\n\n- Waiting for September -\n\nAt the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.\n\nSince then, the data has painted a much better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 65 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.\n\nThose cuts are expected to come in the form of three quarter-point moves.\n\nThe markets now overwhelmingly expect the Fed's first move to come in September, and have assigned a chance of less than five percent that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will move on Wednesday.\n\n\"The case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is strong and we anticipate that it will use the July meeting to plant the seed that the first move in the normalization cycle is on the table for September,\" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\n- 'Modest further progress' -\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in Washington earlier this month that recent data \"have shown some modest further progress\" against inflation.\n\n\"More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent,\" he added.\n\nPowell is unlikely \"to broadcast an exact date for when the FOMC may start lowering rates\" when he speaks to reporters later on Wednesday, Farooqi from HFE said.\n\n\"But he will probably acknowledge that inflation is moving in the right direction, and the FOMC is moving closer to gaining sufficient confidence to make the policy stance less restrictive,\" she added.\n\nPowell will have further opportunities over the summer to make the Fed's position clear -- including his keynote address to a gathering of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next month.\n\n\"We believe Powell will wait until Jackson Hole end August -- by which time the Fed will have another month's data -- to deliver the explicit September cut signal,\" economists at Evercore ISI wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nIf the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.\n\nda/aha", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news",

On Wall Street, the outlook for an interest rate cut has shifted from if to when.\n\nThe central bank will issue its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday after a months-long stretch of data has established the key conditions for a rate cut: cooling inflation and slowing job gains.\n\nStill, economists expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, offering the central bank time to ensure current trends hold ahead of its next meeting in September.\n\nThe chances of an interest rate cut at the Fed's meeting in September stand at more than 85%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. The same tool shows the odds of a rate cut on Wednesday at a meager 5%.\n\nThe economy appears to be hurtling toward interest rate cuts later this year, nevertheless. Such an outcome would deliver long-sought loan relief for households and businesses saddled with expensive debt.\n\nPrice increases have slowed significantly from a peak of more than 9%, though inflation remains a percentage point higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%. An outright drop in prices in June compared to the month prior marked a major sign of progress in slowing inflation.\n\nThe labor market has continued to grow but its breakneck pace has cooled. The unemployment rate has ticked up this year from 3.7% to 4.1%.\n\nThe Fed is guided by a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and the labor market strong. The monthslong stretch of good news for inflation alongside bad news for unemployment has prompted the Fed to give additional consideration to its goal of keeping Americans on the job, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month.\n\n\"For a long time, since inflation arrived, it's been right to mainly focus on inflation. But now that inflation has come down and the labor market has indeed cooled off, we're going to be looking at both mandates. They're in much better balance,\" Powell said at a meeting of The Economic Club of Washington, D.C.\n\n\"That means that if we were to see an unexpected weakening in the labor market, then that might also be a reason for reaction by us,\" Powell added.\n\nHowever, robust economic data released last week may complicate the path toward a rate cut.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew much faster than expected over three months ending in June, accelerating from the previous quarter and defying concerns about a possible slowdown, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nIf the Fed cuts interest rates as the economy is heating up, the central bank risks rekindling rapid price increases.\n\nAfter the economic data came out last Thursday, the odds of a September interest rate cut fell to about 80%.

Here's Why You Shouldn't Expect a Cut, For Now", "body": "Our mission is to help you make informed financial decisions, and we hold ourselves to strict editorial guidelines . This post may contain links to products from our partners, which may earn us a commission. Here's a more detailed explanation of how we make money .\n\nConsider this the Federal Reserve's final summer fling. It's holding tight to high interest rates for one more meeting before cutting rates in September. At least, that's how a lot of us are hoping this plays out.\n\nFor months, we've been hearing that if inflation goes down, the Federal Reserve -- which is responsible for keeping prices stable -- will start cutting interest rates. Cooling consumer prices and lowering borrowing and credit rates would give us all some financial relief.\n\nThis story is a part of Fed Watch, CNET's coverage of the Federal Reserve's Open Committee meetings and what's next for interest rates.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee isn't expected to cut rates at its meeting today, though. Most experts are wagering on September as the one rate cut this year, though some optimistic forecasts project a second cut before the close of 2024.\n\nThe Fed attempted to curb soaring inflation over the last three years by hiking the federal funds rate to its current target range of 5.25% to 5.5%. High interest rates make it more expensive to borrow money and take on debt, causing consumers and businesses to pull back on spending and slow demand.\n\nLast week's Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed's primary tool for measuring inflation, showed annual price growth at 2.5% in June. While not a drastic step down from recent monthly reports, it's significantly less than record highs in 2022. That's enough progress for lower interest rates to remain on the table this year.\n\nDisinflation isn't the only consideration for the central bank. Higher unemployment and low job growth are signs of a slowing, less robust, economy. If unemployment begins to rise, as it did in June, the Fed might be more motivated to lower interest rates.\n\nIf you're borrowing money -- whether it's taking out a mortgage, a personal loan or using a credit card -- higher interest rates increase the amount you have to repay on your balance. If you're saving money, however, higher interest rates can help you grow your money. Whatever your financial situation, the Fed's decision can have a significant impact on your finances.\n\nFinancial experts, who make predictions based on the central bank's cues, say that while there's no chance for a cut today, a September adjustment is very likely.\n\n\"The Fed likes to signal their moves in advance, and they haven't signaled a July rate cut,\" Robert Fry, chief economist at Robert Fry Economics, said in an email. \"They'll probably drop some hints of a September rate cut at the July meeting.\"\n\nThose hints should be clear during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference today. If you hear the words \"moderating\" more than \"tightening,\" that signals the Fed is feeling more positive about the economy's direction, and rate cuts are likely to come in September, according to Gregory Heym, chief economist at real estate service company Brown Harris Stevens.\n\nIf Powell suggests that the Fed could make a second rate cut this year, that could positively influence investor confidence and send stock prices up. The Fed has three meetings left in 2024:\n\nExperts say we shouldn't wait for a Fed meeting to make financial decisions. Interest rates are the highest in over 20 years, and three years of inflated prices are hurting our ability to save and afford everyday goods.\n\nIf you're carrying a credit card balance, expect your annual percentage rates to remain high through the end of the year. You should be doing everything you can to pay off your debt regardless of what the Fed does, particularly since any cuts won't drastically affect your interest rate.\n\nIf you were waiting for rates to drop to buy a home, don't expect major relief anytime soon. But if you're ready to buy, here's why this expert thinks trying to time a home purchase with interest rate cuts is a bad idea.\n\nSavings rates are likely to drop as soon as the Fed signals it will cut interest rates.

Its favored measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labor market has come into better balance.\n\nDespite the improved economic picture, the Fed is not expected to make its first rate cut at the conclusion of a two-day policymakers' meeting on Wednesday, High Frequency Economics (HFE) chief US economist Rubeela Farooqi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nRecent comments from Fed officials \"suggest that they will remain on hold at their meeting... but have moved closer to a first interest rate cut,\" Goldman Sachs US chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published Friday.\n\nInstead, the Fed's rate-setting committee \"is likely to revise its statement to hint that a cut at the following meeting in September has become more likely,\" he said.\n\n- Waiting for September -\n\nAt the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.\n\nSince then, the data has painted a much better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 65 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.\n\nThose cuts are expected to come in the form of three quarter-point moves.\n\nThe markets now overwhelmingly expect the Fed's first move to come in September, and have assigned a chance of less than five percent that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will move on Wednesday.\n\n\"The case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is strong and we anticipate that it will use the July meeting to plant the seed that the first move in the normalization cycle is on the table for September,\" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\n- 'Modest further progress' -\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in Washington earlier this month that recent data \"have shown some modest further progress\" against inflation.\n\n\"More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent,\" he added.\n\nPowell is unlikely \"to broadcast an exact date for when the FOMC may start lowering rates\" when he speaks to reporters later on Wednesday, Farooqi from HFE said.\n\n\"But he will probably acknowledge that inflation is moving in the right direction, and the FOMC is moving closer to gaining sufficient confidence to make the policy stance less restrictive,\" she added.\n\nPowell will have further opportunities over the summer to make the Fed's position clear -- including his keynote address to a gathering of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next month.\n\n\"We believe Powell will wait until Jackson Hole end August -- by which time the Fed will have another month's data -- to deliver the explicit September cut signal,\" economists at Evercore ISI wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nIf the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.\n\nda/aha\n\nMore from this section\n\nChurch of Scientology Forum on the

Committee members will also carefully craft their written statement during the meeting to indicate their current stance on the economy, which market watchers and economists parse word by word.\n\nMost economists and traders think the Fed will hold its benchmark interest rate when it announces its policy decision on Wednesday. The Fed has held the influential rate at 23-year highs since last July to slow the economy and, in turn, tame inflation.\n\nAnd, to some extent, it has been working. While progress has largely stalled out so far this year, inflation is down significantly from its peak in 2022. The job market is softening through fewer hires, not more layoffs, which is exactly what the Fed has said it would like to see.\n\nA few economists have made the case that central bankers should cut interest rates at their meeting this week, no matter how unlikely. On the opposite end of the spectrum, other economists say the Fed should wait until next year.\n\nHowever, neither outcome is likely, even by the measure of those posing the theories.

Job openings and hiring data released on Tuesday showed continued resilience in the job market, with the number of open positions remaining above 8 million.\n\nThe layoffs rate also dropped. The rate at which workers are quitting jobs and the ratio of unemployed people to open positions, now at 1.2, are both roughly where they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, a fact that has led Fed officials to regard the supply of and demand for workers in the economy as roughly balanced.\n\nThe employment cost index, a quarterly measure that includes wages and benefits, increased 0.9% in the second quarter, less than the 1% gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll. The reading likely will add to the sense among Fed officials that the job market and rising wages won't stoke new price increases.\n\n\"The labor market has cooled over the last several months but isn't weak,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics. \"That's a scenario the Federal Reserve wants to guard against, and we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in September.\"\n\nThe central bank's new policy statement will be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference half an hour later.\n\n'NORMALIZATION OF ACTIVITY'\n\nAnalysts say they expect Powell to emphasize that the Fed will remain \"data-dependent\" when it comes to its ultimate rates decision, with a larger-than-usual gap of time between now and the next meeting and more data to go along with it.\n\nThat begins with the release on Friday of the Labor Department's employment report for July. Economists polled by Reuters on average expect firms added a still-solid 175,000 jobs this month, with the unemployment rate unchanged.\n\nRecent data has shown inflation continuing to slow, with the headline personal consumption expenditures price index increasing at a 2.5% annual rate in June and at around 1.5% for the last three months.\n\nThe Fed targets 2% annual inflation based on the PCE price index.\n\n\"The Fed does not believe it needs to hurry\" and cut rates now, said Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors. After a strong initial report on second-quarter economic growth, \"the data remain consistent with a normalization of activity rather than a sharper slowdown. Rate cuts at this point are still preemptive with the goal of stabilizing activity at the current near-trend pace.\"\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://static.zawya.com/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/NDkzNDkwNTMtMDY3YS00/7/usa-fed.jpeg?f=3%3A2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 113, "textEnd": 124, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

It's making it harder for businesses to invest.\"\n\nAmericans will likely have to wait a bit longer for those cuts, however. \"A July Federal Reserve interest rate cut is unlikely but it will be debated and the decision second-guessed if we see weakening economic data over the next month or so,\" Greg McBride, Bankrate's chief financial analyst, said in written commentary. \"The Fed will instead guide expectations toward a September rate move, pending continued improvement on the inflation front.\"\n\nData released in July showed inflation continued to slow down. The consumer price index increased 3.0% for the 12 months ending June, a cooler rate than the 3.3% in May. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index also showed how inflation is getting closer to the Fed's 2% target. The year-over-year increase for this inflation indicator was 2.5%, just slightly cooler than the 2.6% rise in May.\n\nThere's also been a rebalancing in the labor market. Monthly job gains have been under 300,000 this year, except for the 310,000 in March. Plus, real GDP surged at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the year's second quarter, far above the 1.4% in the first quarter. Those numbers all point to the soft landing the Fed is looking for, during which the central bank can fight inflation while avoiding a recession.\n\nThe data has shown the economy is moving in the right direction, inching toward the Fed's 2% inflation target. Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been clear that he does not want the central bank to move too quickly and cut rates too soon, running the risk of having to hike rates again at a later meeting.\n\n\"If we loosen policy too late or too little, we could hurt economic activity,\" Powell said before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on July 9. \"If we loosen policy too much or too soon, then we could undermine the progress on inflation.\"\n\nSome economists and Democratic lawmakers have been urging the Fed to cut rates as soon as possible, given the economic progress the country has made. Sahm told Business Insider that \"we have seen the US economy has been getting back on track, normalizing, rebalancing, all of the Fed's catchwords for some time now.\"\n\nDespite the strong recent numbers, some commentators noted that the economy could slow later this year, pushing the Fed to speed up its rate cuts. \"Though second-quarter GDP surprised to the upside, it holds that a downturn in the labor market or considerable financial market stress is much easier to envision,\" Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's Analytics, said in written commentary shared with Business Insider. \"For that reason, the Fed should start moving. After September's cut, we expect another in December and then a roughly quarter-point per quarter pace thereafter.\"\n\nDemocratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Jacky Rosen, and John Hickenlooper also sent a letter to Powell on June 10 urging him to cut rates, saying that keeping interest rates high is \"threatening the health of the economy and risking a recession that could push thousands of American workers out of their jobs.\"\n\n\"You have kept interest rates too high for too long: it is time to cut rates,\" they wrote.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

But a growing crowd of economists -- among them, former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder and Nobel prize-winner Paul Krugman -- are urging central bankers to cut now rather than at September's meeting, when it is widely expected to do so.\n\nAs Blinder put it in his Wall Street Journal op-ed this week: \"Why wait?\" But there's an equally strong case to be made for the opposite question: Why not wait?\n\nThe argument Blinder and other economists are making is: If you're on track to cut in two months anyway, central bankers should get it out the door sooner rather than later because monetary policy comes with what's referred to as long and variable lags. In other words, it takes time for the Fed's actions to be felt across the economy.\n\nThe Fed raised interest rates to their highest level in more than two decades to intentionally slow part of the economy and get inflation back down to the central bank's 2% target after it soared to a 40-year high in 2022.\n\nInflation still remains above target, but just by a smidge. So, leaving rates this high for even longer in hopes that it will help get inflation down a bit more risks hurting the economy more than helping it.\n\nIf all that keeps up, the economy could weaken even more substantially.\n\nBut it's far from doom and gloom out there at the moment.\n\nThe economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter of this year, exceeding economists' expectations, all while inflation continued to retreat closer to the 2% target -- a combination that's historically rare.\n\nAnd even though the unemployment rate is rising employers are continuing to hire more than 100,000 workers a month.\n\nAt the same time, March's Consumer Price Index report, which showed annual inflation unexpectedly jumped to 3.5%, is a reminder that there's no guarantee price hikes will stay on their current path.\n\nThat's why Torsten Slok, Apollo Global's chief economist, is maintaining his prior forecast that the Fed won't cut rates at all this year.\n\n\"There are still two more CPI releases before the September 18 [Fed] meeting, so we have to wait and see if the downtrend in inflation continues,\" he told CNN. \"With solid job growth and solid consumer spending, we think the current market pricing of three cuts this year is wrong.\"\n\nUniversity of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith also believes it's too early to start cutting now. \"With the economy running stronger than expected, it doesn't seem there should be an urgency for rate cuts,\" he said in a Tuesday note. If it were up to him, the Fed wouldn't start cutting until \"well into 2025.\"\n\nAll eyes on September\n\nThe chances of that happening are about as high as getting a blizzard in the middle of the summer, though.\n\nFed officials have signaled that September will be when they finally lower interest rates. If they end up doing that, no one should lose sleep over whether central bank officials should have made that move in July or waited until November or December -- assuming the economy maintains more or less the status quo.\n\nThe difference between a few months for that initial cut \"really doesn't matter unless there's some big shock that hits the economy in that time,\" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier this month. For instance, if the Fed were to cut rates at this month's meeting, and Iran were to go to war directly with Israel, causing energy prices to spike, the central bank would likely regret loosening its grip on the economy because it could foreseeably contribute to even higher inflation.\n\nWithout a shock like that, it's pointless to play a what-if game, Waller said.\n\nBut Waller acknowledged that the timing is significant for investors who bet on what the Fed's next move will be. \"Whereas we're looking at what's going to happen to the game as a whole, not just any play.\" And to them, he said, the decision boils down to \"when are the conditions right to go.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Just how aggressive they are in spreading those breadcrumbs is the main question markets will be looking to answer.\n\n\"Our expectation is that they're going to keep rates unchanged,\" said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. \"But there's going to be a lot of focus on the [post-meeting] statement, perhaps teeing up September as whatever the opposite of liftoff is.\"\n\nMarket pricing currently indicates an absolute certainty that the Fed will approve its first reduction in more than four years -- when it meets Sept. 17-18. The central bank has kept its benchmark funds rate in a range of 5.25-%-5.5% for the past year. The rate indicates what banks charge each other for overnight lending but sets a guidepost for a slew of other consumer debt products.\n\nAs for this week's meeting, which concludes Wednesday, traders are assigning a very small possibility of a cut. However, there are expectations that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will drop signals that as long as there are no major data hiccups, a September move is very much on the table.\n\nReynolds thinks the committee, along with Chair Jerome Powell at his news conference, will want to keep its options at least somewhat open.\n\n\"They're going to want to strike a balance. They don't want investors to start pricing in a rate cut coming in September and there's literally nothing else that could possibly happen,\" he said.\n\n\"Opening the door for that rate cut is probably the most appropriate thing for them at this point,\" Reynolds added. \"But the markets are already pretty excited about that, pricing it in with nearly 100% probability. So the Fed doesn't have to do too much to change the narrative on that at all. I think if they just directionally tailor the statement, it'll get the job done.\"\n\nGlenmede expects that starting in September, the Fed could cut at each of the three remaining meetings. That is largely in line with market expectations, as measured by the CME's FedWatch gauge of pricing in 30-day fed funds futures contracts.\n\nThere are a few ways the Fed can guide markets on its likely intent without making too much of a commitment. Subtle language changes in the statement can help that along, and Powell could be expected to have some scripted answers ready for the press conference to convey the likely path of future policy.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists see the FOMC making a few alterations.\n\nOne critical change could be a line in the statement that says the committee won't reduce rates until it \"has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle expects the Fed to qualify that statement to say it now needs only \"somewhat greater confidence\" to start easing.\n\n\"Recent comments from Fed officials ... suggest that they will remain on hold at their meeting [this] week but have moved closer to a first interest rate cut,\" Mericle said in a note. \"The main reason that the FOMC is closer to cutting is the favorable inflation news from May and June.\"\n\nIndeed, the inflation news has gotten better though still isn't great -- most metrics have the pace of price increases still running a half a percentage point or more above the Fed's target, but they have eased sharply from their mid-2022 peaks. The Fed's preferred gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed 12-month inflation at a 2.5% rate in June; the consumer price index had it at 3% and showed an actual decline of 0.1% from the previous month.\n\nStill, don't expect too much enthusiasm from Fed officials.\n\n\"The inflation numbers have bounced around a lot this year,\" said Bill English, the Fed's former director of monetary affairs and now a Yale professor. \"We had quite high numbers last winter. We've had a couple of months of good data now. But, I think they they are genuinely uncertain exactly where inflation is and where it's headed.\"\n\nEnglish expects the Fed to hint at a September move but stop short of providing a detailed road map of what's to follow.\n\nCentral bankers mostly feel they can be patient on policy with inflation easing and broader measures of economic growth continuing to show strength despite the highest benchmark interest rates in 23 years. For instance, gross domestic product accelerated at a better-than-expected 2.8% annualized pace in the second quarter, and the labor market has been strong as well even with an unemployment rate that has drifted higher.\n\n\"Given where inflation is, given where the economy is, it's appropriate to ease but not to be seen as committing to a whole chain of easing,\" English said. \"It's difficult to communicate clearly about where monetary policy is going.\"\n\nThe Fed will not provide an update on its quarterly summary of economic projections at this meeting. That includes the \"dot plot\" of individual members' expectations for rates as well as informal forecasts on GDP, inflation and unemployment.\n\nThe FOMC does not meet in August except for its annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which traditionally includes a keynote policy speech from the chair.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson Hole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_English", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-1.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 996, "textEnd": 1007}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The market expectation is for rates to remain unchanged. However, the important details will be in the Fed's statement and Powell's speech. Here are the expectations.\n\nContentsFed Interest Rate AssessmentRate Cut Predictions Fed Interest Rate Assessment\n\nInterest rates have reached the highest level in 23 years and have been at their peak for a year. This challenging period for investors, with rapid increases and poor inflation data in the first quarter of this year, has made 2024 difficult for crypto. The next meeting will be held on September 17-18, and if the Fed is to signal a rate cut, it needs to do so at this meeting. Access COINTURK FINANCE to get the latest financial and business news.\n\nEconomists generally believe that Powell will seek more evidence that the 2% inflation target is being approached at this meeting. Indeed, the recent PCE data exceeded expectations, and this data is the inflation indicator monitored by the Fed.\n\nAccording to FactSet, about 9 out of 10 economists say the first rate cut will be in September. The recent inflation data and the downward revision of Non-Farm Payroll figures have also shifted the FedWatch rate in this direction.\n\nRyan Sweet, Chief U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in his latest assessment that the rate cut process is already strongly accepted and that we might hear things about a September cut at the July meeting. Although Fed members foresee only one cut for this year, inflation figures announced before and after this projection could change things in favor of a cut.\n\nRate Cut Predictions\n\nCME FedWatch suggests that there could be cuts in the September, November, and December meetings due to faster-than-expected falling inflation. The probability of three rate cuts in 2024 is 64%. Indeed, in the previous dot plot announced by the Fed for 2024, the median cut estimate by members was 75bp, indicating three cuts. Poor data in the first quarter had led to a revision against risk markets.\n\nAfter inflation peaked at 9.1%, a 40-year high, it has now dropped to 3%. This, combined with Fed Chairman Powell's recent statement, \"We will start cutting before it drops to 2%,\" shows that expectations for September are not unreasonable. Indeed, the Fed now says it is holding meetings where the risks of excessive tightening are also being discussed.\n\nThe Fed has two primary tasks, referred to as its dual mandate. The first is to keep prices stable, preventing abnormal fluctuations in inflation. The second is to achieve maximum employment. With inflation now down to 3%, we have reached a point where an urgent rate cut scenario motivated by excessive loosening in employment is unnecessary. However, employment has loosened in this process, meaning that if the Fed keeps markets tight for longer, it could achieve one of its mandates while failing the other. Powell certainly does not want this.\n\nMoreover, households are now struggling due to high interest rates. Since LendingTree began tracking interest rates in 2019, the average credit card interest rate has climbed to its highest level of 24.84%.\n\nYou can follow our news on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter & Coinmarketcap Disclaimer: The information contained in this article does not constitute investment advice.

Job openings and hiring data released on Tuesday showed continued resilience in the job market, with the number of open positions remaining above 8 million.\n\nThe layoffs rate also dropped. The rate at which workers are quitting jobs and the ratio of unemployed people to open positions, now at 1.2, are both roughly where they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, a fact that has led Fed officials to regard the supply of and demand for workers in the economy as roughly balanced.\n\nThe employment cost index, a quarterly measure that includes wages and benefits, increased 0.9% in the second quarter, less than the 1% gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll. The reading likely will add to the sense among Fed officials that the job market and rising wages won't stoke new price increases.\n\n\"The labor market has cooled over the last several months but isn't weak,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics. \"That's a scenario the Federal Reserve wants to guard against, and we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in September.\"\n\nThe central bank's new policy statement will be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference half an hour later.\n\n'NORMALIZATION OF ACTIVITY'\n\nAnalysts say they expect Powell to emphasize that the Fed will remain \"data-dependent\" when it comes to its ultimate rates decision, with a larger-than-usual gap of time between now and the next meeting and more data to go along with it.\n\nThat begins with the release on Friday of the Labor Department's employment report for July. Economists polled by Reuters on average expect firms added a still-solid 175,000 jobs this month, with the unemployment rate unchanged.\n\nRecent data has shown inflation continuing to slow, with the headline personal consumption expenditures price index increasing at a 2.5% annual rate in June and at around 1.5% for the last three months.\n\nThe Fed targets 2% annual inflation based on the PCE price index.\n\n\"The Fed does not believe it needs to hurry\" and cut rates now, said Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors. After a strong initial report on second-quarter economic growth, \"the data remain consistent with a normalization of activity rather than a sharper slowdown. Rate cuts at this point are still preemptive with the goal of stabilizing activity at the current near-trend pace.\"\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/86/086fbbee-9694-59e8-a7a0-4a716315bdfb/66aa374f078c3.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C48&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 363, "textEnd": 374}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The Fed has seen some substantial progress since then. Inflation is now considerably below the four-decade high from two years ago, and after stalling out in the first three months of the year, price pressures began to slow again in the second quarter. America's labor market remains solid, but it has loosened up over the past year, with unemployment recently rising to its highest level in more than two years and job openings roughly back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFed officials in recent speeches have said they're pleased with the latest inflation data, acknowledging the steady progress but saying they're not quite fully comfortable yet with slashing rates. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, seen as a key messenger of Fed policy moves, said earlier this month that \"while I don't believe we have reached our final destination, I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted.\"\n\nOther officials have pointed to the effects of inflation-adjusted interest rates on the economy, which inherently rise if inflation slows but rates remains unchanged.\n\n\"We are tightening,\" Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. \"We set this rate when inflation was over 4%, and inflation is now, let's call it, 2.5%. That implies we have tightened a lot since we've been holding at this rate.\"\n\nGoolsbee, known for staking out a so-called \"dovish\" stance, or one that prefers to avoid unnecessary damage to the economy from high interest rates, is casting a vote for this month's policy decision, since Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester retired last month.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting news conference, scheduled for 2:30 pm ET, could give markets some much-needed clarity on the timing of the first rate cut, but economists say he likely won't give markets a strong signal for an upcoming rate cut just yet. He has said that an unexpected weakening in the labor market would prompt the Fed to consider cutting rates sooner than expected.\n\nIt's difficult to overstate the rarity of the economic times that Americans are currently living in.\n\nThe US economy is carefully threading a needle to achieve a very rare outcome known as a \"soft landing\" -- a situation in which inflation slows to the Fed's 2% target without a recession, of which there aren't any signs for the foreseeable future. The latest GDP report provided the best evidence for that slowly unfolding reality.\n\nEconomic growth in 2024 has been solid so far, despite the highest interest rates in nearly a quarter century. There has been some evidence of the broader American economy losing steam in some areas, such as US consumers opting for cheaper alternatives, rising consumer debt levels and workers not quitting their jobs as much as they did in recent years. But the US economy is still holding up overall.\n\n\"The numbers do reflect a soft landing,\" Kathleen Grace, managing member and chief executive of Fiduciary Family Office, told CNN. \"But it's hard to predict what inflation will do with a backdrop of strong corporate earnings and a consumer that is still spending.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, the Fed's Waller said that \"current data are consistent with achieving a soft landing, and I will be looking for data over the next couple months to buttress this view.\" Powell has emphasized that victory in wrangling price pressures requires inflation to be at 2% in a \"sustainable\" manner, meaning that it must be hovering around that level for at least a few months.\n\nThe Fed monitors the economy's health overall, so officials parse every major piece of economic data such as the Labor Department's upcoming jobs report on Friday. But the Fed's decision to cut rates will be mainly based on inflation readings, absent any concerning news about the job market.\n\nThe Fed's July monetary policy meeting concludes Wednesday, with an announcement at 2 pm ET, followed by a 2:30 pm ET press conference led by Chair Powell.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Job openings and hiring data released on Tuesday showed continued resilience in the job market, with the number of open positions remaining above 8 million.\n\nThe layoffs rate also dropped. The rate at which workers are quitting jobs and the ratio of unemployed people to open positions, now at 1.2, are both roughly where they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, a fact that has led Fed officials to regard the supply of and demand for workers in the economy as roughly balanced.\n\n\"The labor market has cooled over the last several months but isn't weak,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics. \"That's a scenario the Federal Reserve wants to guard against, and we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in September.\"\n\nThe central bank's new policy statement will be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference half an hour later.\n\n'NORMALIZATION OF ACTIVITY'\n\nAnalysts say they expect Powell to emphasize that the Fed will remain \"data-dependent\" when it comes to its ultimate decision, with a larger-than-usual gap of time between now and the next meeting and more data to go along with it.\n\nThat begins with the release on Friday of the Labor Department's employment report for July. Economists polled by Reuters on average expect firms added a still-solid 175,000 jobs this month, with the unemployment rate unchanged.\n\nRecent data has shown inflation continuing to slow, with the headline personal consumption expenditures price index increasing at a 2.5% annual rate in June and at around 1.5% for the last three months.\n\nThe Fed targets 2% annual inflation based on the PCE price index.\n\n\"The Fed does not believe it needs to hurry\" and cut rates now, said Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors. After a strong initial report on second-quarter economic growth, \"the data remain consistent with a normalization of activity rather than a sharper slowdown. Rate cuts at this point are still preemptive with the goal of stabilizing activity at the current near-trend pace.\"\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 143, "textEnd": 154, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 197, "textEnd": 204}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

At June's FOMC meeting, the most interesting aspect was the Fed moving away from a view of three possible rate cuts this year suggesting just one was the most likely path ahead. But given the recent data flows and financial market moves, this may already seem out of date.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will still leave monetary policy unchanged at next week's FOMC meeting, but we believe they will use it to offer the clearest hint yet that they're starting to seriously consider an interest rate cut, most probably at the subsequent September FOMC meeting. Inflation is looking better behaved, the unemployment rate is on the rise and there is growing evidence that consumer spending is cooling. The Fed has been striving for a \"soft landing\" and if the data allows them to cut, and it is certainly moving in that direction, then we think they will seize the opportunity.\n\nInflation is in a better place\n\nRegarding inflation, both core CPI and the core PCE deflator were running far too hot for comfort in the first quarter, but May and June numbers are looking more encouraging. Most notably, the so-called \"super-core services\" that exclude housing, food and energy, on which the Fed have been putting heavy emphasis, have slowed markedly, and we are finally seeing the key housing components reflecting the moderation witnessed in third-party private rent series.\n\nFed Governor Christopher Waller stated last week that \"I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted\", and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, at his recent appearance before Congress, added that \"more good data would strengthen our confidence\" that inflation is on the path to 2%. We think they will get it for the July and August inflation reports. This is a necessary requirement - but not sufficient on its own - for a September interest rate cut.\n\nA \"soft landing\" is possible if the Fed is able to cuts rates\n\nThe second area in which we need to see moderation is the labour market. The unemployment rate has risen from a low of 3.4% in April of last year to 4.1% in June, above the 4% level the Fed predicted for the end of the year at their most recent forecast round. Governor Waller has warned that \"there is more upside risk to unemployment than we have seen for a long time.\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly suggested, \"We don't want to be to a point where we start to see the labour market weaken substantially - to falter - because by then, it is actually often too late to bring it back\".\n\nFor now, the rise in unemployment is being caused by labour supply growth outstripping demand; we aren't seeing net job losses. Nonetheless, the ISM and NFIB employment indicators suggest risks on this front are growing. Even if we don't see net job losses, the growing slack in the jobs market is boosting confidence that wage growth will continue to slow to rates that have long been consistent with an inflation target of 2%.\n\nThe third area the Fed wants to see cooling is the consumer sector, which saw annualised spending growth of 3.2% in the second half of 2023. This has dropped below 2% through the first half of this year, and with income growth slowing, pandemic-era accrued savings being run down, and consumer credit growth under pressure from high borrowing costs and rising loan delinquencies, this third leg of the stool is also starting to argue for the Fed making a policy change.\n\nGrowth to become the greater concern for the Fed with risks skewed toward more cuts\n\nOur position is that the Federal Reserve doesn't want to cause a recession if they can avoid it, and if the data allows, we expect officials to start moving monetary policy from \"restrictive\" territory to \"slightly less\" restrictive policy from September. We are getting very close, and assuming things pan out as we expect, the Fed will use the Jackson Hole symposium to show they're re-evaluating the outlook and will be cutting their growth and inflation forecasts and raising their unemployment projection in September.\n\nThis, we believe, will pave the way for three rate cuts this year in September, November and December, with at least three more next year.\n\nThe 2yr and 10yr are heading to 4% in anticipation of first cut by September\n\nThe spread from the 2yr yield to the effective funds rate has hit a new low at -93bp as we build to a first rate cut in the cycle ahead. The magic level is -100bp, as traditionally, once we hit that level, the market is fully primed for a first cut and the beginning of a sequence of cuts. The 2yr yield is now in the 4.4% area, and tracking towards 4% as a call in the coming couple of months. Getting to 4% can be fast. The only reason for a longer-term call is the Fed is not expected to cut at the upcoming meeting, but it seems it is more minded to cut on 18 September. It is possible, however, for the Fed to give the move a push should they use the July meeting to nod towards the likelihood of a cut at the September meeting.\n\nThe 10yr yield is also tracking towards 4%. Now in the 4.2% area, the inversion of the curve is under 20bp. As the 2yr yield and the 10yr yield head towards 4%, the curve completely flattens out, and from there, we build an upward-sloping curve as the Fed continues along the rate-cutting process over subsequent months.\n\nCommentary on liquidity conditions and the shrinking of the Fed's balance sheet is usually buried in the detailed statement and rarely voluntarily opined on at the press conference. We expect something similar this time. The Fed has already pre-positioned with an early (in our view) tapering of the quantitative tightening process. This continues in the background and has not yet hit levels where particular concerns for liquidity circumstances are warranted.\n\nThat said, we find it noteworthy that balances going back to the Federal Reserve on the reverse repo facility have been sticky in the UD$400bn area, a material change from the big falls seen through 2023 and into early 2024. We view this balance as a manifestation of excess liquidity and, ideally, should shrink in line with the quantitative tightening process. If it doesn't, then bank reserves, now at $3.3tn, will be pressured to fall. Should they get under US$3tn, then we have a contradictory material tightening in liquidity conditions, just as the Fed starts to ease interest rate policy.\n\nFX: Some downside risks to the dollar\n\nLower US short-dated rates have taken the dollar roughly 1.5-2.0% lower through July, although its bilateral performance has very much been driven by the unwinding of carry trade strategies. Probably one of the first questions for the market will be whether the Fed feels the need to steer the market towards a September rate cut by changing the language in the FOMC statement. For example, the June 2019 statement used the below turn of phrase before the Fed delivered a rate cut in July:\n\n'The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased. In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion'\n\nThe Fed may prefer to keep its options open rather than commit to this kind of language, but there's certainly a risk. Up until the Fed's last press conference in June, Chair Powell had been reliably dovish, and the dollar had softened. But in June, Chair Powell surprised on the more conservative side, perhaps to be consistent with the Fed's Dot Plot message of one rather than three expected rate cuts this year.\n\nBut as above, we think the direction of travel for US short-term rates is lower and the FOMC meeting presents a negative risk event for the dollar. Given still heavy short positioning in the yen, USD/JPY risks probably still lie to the downside (the Bank of Japan will have decided policy earlier in the day) and EUR/USD could nudge higher on the view that near-term easing from the world's most influential central bank will support faltering global growth prospects.\n\nEqually, if dovish Fed rhetoric does not emerge by 31 July, the dollar is unlikely to rally too far. The Jackson Hole Fed symposium in late August is another chance for the Fed to signal a September rate cut.\n\nSource: ING", "source": {"uri": "hellenicshippingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hellenic Shipping News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_tightening", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative tightening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Daly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mary Daly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_San_Francisco", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Federation of Independent Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson Hole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacifism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ING Group"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 4893, "textEnd": 4905}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 8391, "textEnd": 8398}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 6884, "textEnd": 6893}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Job openings and hiring data released on Tuesday showed continued resilience in the job market, with the number of open positions remaining above 8 million.\n\nThe layoffs rate also dropped. The rate at which workers are quitting jobs and the ratio of unemployed people to open positions, now at 1.2, are both roughly where they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, a fact that has led Fed officials to regard the supply of and demand for workers in the economy as roughly balanced.\n\n\"The labor market has cooled over the last several months but isn't weak,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics. \"That's a scenario the Federal Reserve wants to guard against, and we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in September.\"\n\nThe central bank's new policy statement will be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference half an hour later.\n\n'NORMALIZATION OF ACTIVITY'\n\nAnalysts say they expect Powell to emphasize that the Fed will remain \"data-dependent\" when it comes to its ultimate decision, with a larger-than-usual gap of time between now and the next meeting and more data to go along with it.\n\nThat begins with the release on Friday of the Labor Department's employment report for July. Economists polled by Reuters on average expect firms added a still-solid 175,000 jobs this month, with the unemployment rate unchanged.\n\nRecent data has shown inflation continuing to slow, with the headline personal consumption expenditures price index increasing at a 2.5% annual rate in June and at around 1.5% for the last three months.\n\nThe Fed targets 2% annual inflation based on the PCE price index.\n\n\"The Fed does not believe it needs to hurry\" and cut rates now, said Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors. After a strong initial report on second-quarter economic growth, \"the data remain consistent with a normalization of activity rather than a sharper slowdown. Rate cuts at this point are still preemptive with the goal of stabilizing activity at the current near-trend pace.\"\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price index"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/8423ddd/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F5d%2F94dca6157031b0346fa2b69a9e82ff%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK6U0FU%3A12024-07-31T100119Z_1_LYNXMPEK6U0FU_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-FED.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 343, "textEnd": 354}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Market participants widely anticipate that the US central bank will leave the policy rate unchanged at 5.25%-5.5% for the eighth consecutive meeting.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool shows that markets see little to no chance of a rate cut in July but suggests that a September rate reduction is fully priced in. Hence, investors will scrutinize the changes in the statement language and comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to figure out the policy-easing strategy for the rest of the year. According to the FedWatch Tool, there is a nearly 70% probability that the US central bank will cut the policy rate by a total of 75 basis points in 2024.\n\nGrowing optimism about disinflation progress resuming in the second half of the year - following the soft inflation prints seen in the second quarter - became apparent in Fed policymakers' comments before the blackout period.\n\nRichmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said that policymakers will debate at the July policy meeting whether it is still appropriate to describe inflation as elevated. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee acknowledged that they have had multiple months of better inflation data, noting that he feels \"a lot better on inflation.\" Additionally, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that there was significant progress on inflation and that she saw growing confidence in nearing the 2% target.\n\nPreviewing the Fed's July policy meeting, \"the FOMC is widely expected to keep the Fed funds target range unchanged for an eighth consecutive meeting next week, with the Committee's forward guidance proving key for setting up the stage for the start of the easing cycle,\" said TD Securities analysts in a weekly report and added: \"While Powell is likely to fall short from fully committing to a rate cut in September, he is likely to hint that the Fed's almost there.\"\n\nThe US Federal Reserve is scheduled to announce its interest rate decision and publish the monetary policy statement at 18:00 GMT on July 31. This will be followed by Chairman Powell's press conference starting at 18:30 GMT.\n\nIn his last public appearance, Chairman Powell commented on the inflation outlook and said: \"In the second quarter, actually, we did make some more progress on taming inflation,\" and further elaborated: \"We've had three better readings, and if you average them, that's a pretty good place.\"\n\nPowell might not outright confirm a rate cut in September but he is unlikely to push back against this expectation. Investors will be more curious about whether the Fed, or Powell, will leave the door open to multiple rate cuts in the last quarter of the year.\n\nIn case Powell hints that they might opt for additional policy easing toward the end of the year, the immediate market reaction could provide a boost to risk sentiment. In this scenario, the US Dollar (USD) is likely to come under renewed selling pressure. However, the fact that markets have already priced in a strong possibility of a 75 bps total rate reduction this year suggests that the USD doesn't have a lot of room left on the downside.\n\nIf Powell reiterates the data-dependent approach and suggests that they will take their time to assess the impact of the first rate cut on the economy before deciding whether another rate reduction will follow, the USD could stage a rebound, given the market positioning.\n\n\"The 'Goldilocks' US economic backdrop of solid growth and modest disinflation suggests the Fed is unlikely to cut the funds rate as much as is currently priced in. Fed funds futures are pricing almost three cuts by December 2024 and a total of roughly 150 bps of easing over the next 12 months,\" BBH analysts said in assessment of the Fed's policy outlook and further commented on the USD's potential performance:\n\n\"Moreover, rising US productivity can lead to low inflationary economic growth, higher real interest rates and an appreciation in the currency over the longer term.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Eren Sengezer, European Session Lead Analyst at FXStreet, provides a short-term technical outlook for EUR/USD:\n\n\"1.0790-1.0810, where the 200-day, 50-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are located, aligns as a key pivot area for EUR/USD. As long as this area stays intact as support, technical buyers could remain interested. On the upside, the 20-day SMA aligns as interim resistance at 1.0860 before 1.0950 (July 17 high). In case EUR/USD falls below 1.0790-1.0810 and starts using this region as resistance, 1.0700 (psychological level, static level) could be set as the next bearish target before 1.0665 (June 26 low).\"", "source": {"uri": "fxstreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXStreet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Barkin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Barkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_guidance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward guidance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austan_Goolsbee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austan Goolsbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_San_Francisco", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

But a growing crowd of economists -- among them, former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder and Nobel prize-winner Paul Krugman -- are urging central bankers to cut now rather than at September's meeting, when it is widely expected to do so.\n\nAs Blinder put it in his Wall Street Journal op-ed this week: \"Why wait?\" But there's an equally strong case to be made for the opposite question: Why not wait?\n\nThe argument Blinder and other economists are making is: If you're on track to cut in two months anyway, central bankers should get it out the door sooner rather than later because monetary policy comes with what's referred to as long and variable lags. In other words, it takes time for the Fed's actions to be felt across the economy.\n\nThe Fed raised interest rates to their highest level in more than two decades to intentionally slow part of the economy and get inflation back down to the central bank's 2% target after it soared to a 40-year high in 2022.\n\nInflation still remains above target, but just by a smidge. So, leaving rates this high for even longer in hopes that it will help get inflation down a bit more risks hurting the economy more than helping it.\n\nSome bruises are appearing\n\nOn the labor side of the economy, job openings are fading, the unemployment rate is creeping higher and some industries are laying off more workers than they're hiring. Consumers, meanwhile, have signaled a weaker (but still decent) appetite for spending in recent months.\n\nIf all that keeps up, the economy could weaken even more substantially.\n\nBut it's far from doom and gloom out there at the moment.\n\nThe economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter of this year, exceeding economists' expectations, all while inflation continued to retreat closer to the 2% target -- a combination that's historically rare.\n\nAnd even though the unemployment rate is rising employers are continuing to hire more than 100,000 workers a month.\n\nConsumers are spending more cautiously, but they're far from tapped out.\n\nBrandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nAt the same time, March's Consumer Price Index report, which showed annual inflation unexpectedly jumped to 3.5%, is a reminder that there's no guarantee price hikes will stay on their current path.\n\nThat's why Torsten Slok, Apollo Global's chief economist, is maintaining his prior forecast that the Fed won't cut rates at all this year.\n\n\"There are still two more CPI releases before the September 18 [Fed] meeting, so we have to wait and see if the downtrend in inflation continues,\" he told CNN. \"With solid job growth and solid consumer spending, we think the current market pricing of three cuts this year is wrong.\"\n\nUniversity of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith also believes it's too early to start cutting now. \"With the economy running stronger than expected, it doesn't seem there should be an urgency for rate cuts,\" he said in a Tuesday note. If it were up to him, the Fed wouldn't start cutting until \"well into 2025.\"\n\nAll eyes on September\n\nThe chances of that happening are about as high as getting a blizzard in the middle of the summer, though.\n\nFed officials have signaled that September will be when they finally lower interest rates. If they end up doing that, no one should lose sleep over whether central bank officials should have made that move in July or waited until November or December -- assuming the economy maintains more or less the status quo.\n\nThe difference between a few months for that initial cut \"really doesn't matter unless there's some big shock that hits the economy in that time,\" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier this month. For instance, if the Fed were to cut rates at this month's meeting, and Iran were to go to war directly with Israel, causing energy prices to spike, the central bank would likely regret loosening its grip on the economy because it could foreseeably contribute to even higher inflation.\n\nWithout a shock like that, it's pointless to play a what-if game, Waller said.\n\nBut Waller acknowledged that the timing is significant for investors who bet on what the Fed's next move will be. \"Whereas we're looking at what's going to happen to the game as a whole, not just any play.\" And to them, he said, the decision boils down to \"when are the conditions right to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elisabeth_buchwald@cnn.com", "name": "Elisabeth Buchwald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Blinder", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alan Blinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Krugman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Central_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Central Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2160715844.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 2750, "textEnd": 2762}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The decision will be announced via a post-meeting statement at 2 p.m. in Washington. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.\n\nPolicymakers are likely to acknowledge that inflation has made progress toward their 2% goal -- a prerequisite for rate cuts -- following tame readings on consumer prices for the month of June. With unemployment also edging higher, officials will probably indicate it's appropriate for policy to become less tight soon.\n\n\"I think that they are going to change the language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting,\" said Subadra Rajappa, head of US rates strategy at Societe Generale. She pointed to recent comments from New York Fed President John Williams, who \"has said that they are looking to move away from restrictive territory -- so they could use that sort of language as well.\"\n\nRate Decision\n\nAll economists surveyed by Bloomberg are looking for no change in rates at this meeting. In their statement, policymakers are likely to highlight the improved inflation outlook. Instead of saying there has been \"modest\" progress, as they did in June, the FOMC could say there has been \"further progress.\"\n\nThe committee could also say it has gained some additional confidence that inflation is moving to the 2% target, a signal that it expects rate cuts soon.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\"Markets have fully priced in a Fed rate cut in September, but the big question for the July 30-31 FOMC meeting is: How clearly will the FOMC signal this? We think communications from the July meeting will offer only tentative hints of a September cut, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting the potential for a cut 'if data evolve as we expect.'\"\n\nWhile investors put the odds of a rate cut this week at under 5%, officials may at least discuss the possibility at the meeting. A number of prominent voices have recently argued the case for a July move, including former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder, Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius and former New York Fed President William Dudley.\n\nSome economists say they will be watching to see whether Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, a leading dove, will become the first policymaker in more than two years to cast a dissenting vote against the official decision. Goolsbee will vote this week as an alternate following the retirement of Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester in June.\n\nPress Conference\n\nPowell is likely to be pressed by reporters on the outlook for the next meeting in September, as well as the pace of easing for the rest of this year and next. While he will probably welcome recent good news on inflation, he may also fall back on the Fed's standard language that its policy path will be \"data dependent\" and the central bank is plotting moves \"meeting by meeting.\"\n\nThe chair is also set to be quizzed on his level of concern about a cooling labor market and what would constitute an \"unexpected weakening\" that would call for a response. The unemployment rate, at 4.1%, is up from a low of 3.4% in early 2023. Data for July will be published on Friday.\n\nAt the moment, investors are pricing in slightly more than a quarter-percentage point of easing for September, indicating they see some risk of a bigger cut than the typical 25 basis-point increment. They also see cuts in November and December as likely, according to futures.\n\n\"Powell could be asked about what would meet the bar for the 'unexpected weakening' that makes them reassess whether quarterly 25 basis point cuts are enough,\" said Derek Tang, an an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics..\n\nWhile Powell may again be asked about the November presidential election, he's almost certain to repeat his standard line that politics plays no role in the Fed's rate decisions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The Fed has seen some substantial progress since then. Inflation is now considerably below the four-decade high from two years ago, and after stalling out in the first three months of the year, price pressures began to slow again in the second quarter. America's labor market remains solid, but it has loosened up over the past year, with unemployment recently rising to its highest level in more than two years and job openings roughly back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFed officials in recent speeches have said they're pleased with the latest inflation data, acknowledging the steady progress but saying they're not quite fully comfortable yet with slashing rates. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, seen as a key messenger of Fed policy moves, said earlier this month that \"while I don't believe we have reached our final destination, I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted.\"\n\nOther officials have pointed to the effects of inflation-adjusted interest rates on the economy, which inherently rise if inflation slows but rates remains unchanged.\n\n\"We are tightening,\" Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. \"We set this rate when inflation was over 4%, and inflation is now, let's call it, 2.5%. That implies we have tightened a lot since we've been holding at this rate.\"\n\nGoolsbee, known for staking out a so-called \"dovish\" stance, or one that prefers to avoid unnecessary damage to the economy from high interest rates, is casting a vote for this month's policy decision, since Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester retired last month.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting news conference, scheduled for 2:30 pm ET, could give markets some much-needed clarity on the timing of the first rate cut, but economists say he likely won't give markets a strong signal for an upcoming rate cut just yet. He has said that an unexpected weakening in the labor market would prompt the Fed to consider cutting rates sooner than expected.\n\nSticking the soft landing?\n\nIt's difficult to overstate the rarity of the economic times that Americans are currently living in.\n\nThe US economy is carefully threading a needle to achieve a very rare outcome known as a \"soft landing\" -- a situation in which inflation slows to the Fed's 2% target without a recession, of which there aren't any signs for the foreseeable future. The latest GDP report provided the best evidence for that slowly unfolding reality.\n\nEconomic growth in 2024 has been solid so far, despite the highest interest rates in nearly a quarter century. There has been some evidence of the broader American economy losing steam in some areas, such as US consumers opting for cheaper alternatives, rising consumer debt levels and workers not quitting their jobs as much as they did in recent years. But the US economy is still holding up overall.\n\n\"The numbers do reflect a soft landing,\" Kathleen Grace, managing member and chief executive of Fiduciary Family Office, told CNN. \"But it's hard to predict what inflation will do with a backdrop of strong corporate earnings and a consumer that is still spending.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, the Fed's Waller said that \"current data are consistent with achieving a soft landing, and I will be looking for data over the next couple months to buttress this view.\" Powell has emphasized that victory in wrangling price pressures requires inflation to be at 2% in a \"sustainable\" manner, meaning that it must be hovering around that level for at least a few months.\n\nThe Fed monitors the economy's health overall, so officials parse every major piece of economic data such as the Labor Department's upcoming jobs report on Friday. But the Fed's decision to cut rates will be mainly based on inflation readings, absent any concerning news about the job market.\n\nThe Fed's July monetary policy meeting concludes Wednesday, with an announcement at 2 pm ET, followed by a 2:30 pm ET press conference led by Chair Powell.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Today we'll explore those questions. Let's first start off with what we know.\n\nWe know that tomorrow, the Fed will leave its target rate unchanged. That decision will keep the federal funds target at 5.50%. Why am I so confident about saying that?\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nOver the course of 19 FOMC meetings beginning March 16, 2022, I've been correct in all of my forecasts, including the policy rate pause that began in September 2023. I'm confident I'll be correct tomorrow also.\n\nIn addition, I expect the Fed will do nothing to contradict prior indications that the rate hike cycle that began in March 2022 is over. In effect, the Fed has concluded that they have reached the terminal rate. That's the rate at which inflation is expected to come down on its own without further rate hikes.\n\nIn the Fed's view, the lagged effect of prior interest rate hikes will do the job of lowering inflation to the Fed's target of 2.0%. No further action is required. It's just a matter of time and patience.\n\nThis FOMC announcement tomorrow will not include an updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), known as the \"dots.\" These are forecasts of interest rates, unemployment and economic growth offered by members of the Board of Governors of the Fed and regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents.\n\nThe dots have been wildly inaccurate in the past. While the dots are technically unimportant and usually wrong, they're played up in the media. It's a relief that there will be no dots from this meeting for the media to chew over. There will be a press conference by Fed Chair Jay Powell after the meeting.\n\nThe reason for the Fed not cutting rates (the infamous \"pivot\" that Wall Street has been wrong about for two years) is that the Fed is losing the battle against inflation.\n\nWhen inflation (measured monthly by CPI on a year-over-year basis) dropped from 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.0% in June 2023, the Fed was ready to declare victory. Its goal was still 2.0% annualized inflation, but progress from 9.1% to 3.0% was so dramatic that 2.0% seemed well within reach. It was around that time (July 2023) that the Fed hit the pause button on further rate hikes.\n\nSince then, the inflation news has been consistently bad for the Fed.\n\nHere's the tale of the inflation tape using the Consumer Price Index on a year-over year basis:\n\nSeveral facts jump out immediately from this most recent 13-month time series. The first is that inflation isn't going down in a convincing way.It's true that inflation dropped from 3.3% in May to 3.0% in June. But the June 2024 3.0% reading is identical to the June 2023 3.0% reading.\n\nIn other words, inflation hasn't moved at all in over a year.\n\nInflation has bounced around somewhat over the past 13 months, including spikes to 3.7% in August and September 2023. Still, inflation hasn't budged materially from the 3.1% level reached in January 2024.\n\nThe best that can be said is that inflation is in a range of 3.0-3.7% with a central tendency of about 3.3%. It's been stuck in that range for over one year and is not trending toward the Fed's stated goal of 2.0%.\n\nImportantly, even if the drop from 3.3% in May to 3.0% in June is the beginning of a sustainable downward trend (that's not yet clear), it'll take at least two more months of positive data to convince the Fed that this is a trend and not just another monthly gyration.\n\nThat takes a July rate cut off the table and probably September too.\n\nFor purposes of analyzing inflation, I use the headline CPI number. The reason is simple -- that's the number that everyday Americans actually pay at the grocery store and the gas pump, so it's the best number for understanding behavioral responses, changes in expectations and political implications.\n\nThe eggheads at the Fed and Wall Street have devised \"core CPI\" (excluding food and energy), \"super-core CPI\" (excluding food, energy and housing), \"core PCE\" (a completely different index that the Fed prefers that also excludes food and energy), \"trimmed-mean CPI\" (this measure disregards the highest and lowest figures as \"outliers\") and so on.\n\nThese measures are devised by economists who must not have enough to do. I understand them all, but I also understand that they're abstractions that don't sync up with what people actually pay. Show me someone who doesn't spend money on food, gas, home heating and rent and maybe I'll pay attention, but not sooner.", "source": {"uri": "sgtreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SGT Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Powell_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Powell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-03-", "textStart": 562, "textEnd": 570}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The timing of the pivot is no longer in question, only the pace, with markets pricing in 100% odds of a quarter-point rate cut by the Sept. 18 Fed meeting.\n\nFed Chair Powell\n\nWhile Powell won't commit to easing in September, it's a good bet that he'll call it a \"live meeting,\" meaning a rate cut will be on the table.\n\nIn recent appearances, Powell's tone has turned more dovish. \"We are getting back on a disinflationary path,\" Powell said in early July, even before tame June consumer price index data confirmed the trend.\n\nPowell told Congress on July 12 that the labor market \"appears to be fully back in balance,\" meaning the supply of available workers roughly matches hiring demand. As a result, the labor market is \"not a source of broad inflationary pressures for the economy now.\"\n\nJob Market Holds Key To Outlook\n\nThe Fed's primary inflation gauge, the core PCE price index, didn't obviously advance the disinflationary story, with last week's release showing the 12-month core inflation rate holding at 2.6%, above 2.5% forecasts. That followed stronger-than-expected 2.8% GDP growth in Q2, suggesting the economy isn't at risk of rolling over.\n\nYet the recent data only amounted to a pause in the disinflation story, not a reversal. Meanwhile, the June jobs was probably almost as soft as the Fed wants to see. After sharp downward revisions to earlier data, the average private-sector job gain averaged 145,666 per month in Q2, which is the slowest pace since the massive job loss at the start of the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, average hourly earnings growth has slowed to 3.9% and the jobless rate has climbed to 4.1%, the weakest level for both data point since 2021.\n\nPowell has made the commitment that the Fed won't wait too long to ease, which could lead to unneeded labor market weakness, and it's now the time for him to make good on his word.\n\nHow Fast Will The Fed Cut?\n\nThe Fed has exercised patience in waiting for the right time to pivot, with a full year having now elapsed since the final hike of the cycle last July. It's reasonable to expect a deliberate pace of rate-cutting as long as inflation is still working its way back to 2%. Nomura economists are forecasting one quarter-point rate cut per quarter, unless the labor market takes a turn for the worse.\n\nThat suggests some risk that markets are going a bit too far in pricing in rate cuts. As of Tuesday afternoon, markets are pricing in 64% odds of 75 basis points in rate cuts before the end of the year.\n\nWhile tomorrow's Fed meeting may not substantially shift the Fed rate-cut outlook, Friday's jobs report might.\n\nEconomists expect the July jobs report to show that the economy added 180,000 jobs last month, including 155,000 in the private sector, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%.\n\nJoin IBD Live Each Morning For Stock Tips Before The Open", "source": {"uri": "investors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investor's Business Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meredith_heyman@investors.com", "name": "Meredith Heyman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/stock-Federal-Reserve-06-adobe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 270, "textEnd": 278}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 687, "textEnd": 694}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

However, markets are expecting dovish commentary from the Fed regarding a potential rate cut in September.\n\nA lower-than-expected decline in the US consumer price index, which fell 0.1% in June compared to Dow Jones estimates of a 0.1% increase, and an annual inflation rate of 3% versus the projected 3.1% may influence the Fed's decision-making.\n\nOn the other hand, Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) in the US rose by 206,000 in June, surpassing the market expectation of 190,000.\n\nAccording to CME's FedWatch Tool, there is a slim chance that the Fed might cut rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of Wednesday's meeting, but a rate cut is fully anticipated for the Fed's September meeting.\n\nThis suggests that while immediate policy actions are under review, the market's focus is shifting towards future developments and any potential hints from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on upcoming policy directions.\n\nReliance Securities has predicted two possible scenarios in the Fed meeting outcome.\n\nAccording to the first scenario, Reliance Securities expects that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will opt to maintain key interest rates at current levels at the conclusion of its meeting.\n\n\"While the unemployment rate remains relatively low at 4.1%, it has now edged higher in each of the last three months. It's up from a low of 3.4% in early 2023, raising some concerns about recession risk. So, in this meeting the language in the statement and press conference will be the key drivers,\" Reliance Securities said.\n\n\"Additionally, inflation, which has eased, still remains sticky and has been slow since mid-2023, which could prompt the Fed to say that an early rate cut could backfire and cause inflation to reignite,\" it added.\n\nThe second scenario suggests that it is improbable the Fed will project multiple (3 or more) rate cuts in 2024 as it will be bearish for the Dollar Index.\n\nOn a similar line, Aamar Deo Singh, Senior Vice President of Research at Angel One, said, \"US Fed is unlikely to cut rates in this week's meeting though the softness in jobs data coupled with declining inflationary pressure, all set the stage for a likely rate cut in the near future, most likely in September.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives & Research at SAMCO Securities, said, \"The US Inflation is still hovering above the 2% mark and GDP growth is also fairly steady at 2.8% in the second quarter of the calendar year. Thus, there isn't any sign of distress yet which warrants a rate cut in the forthcoming US Fed meet.

Since the last FOMC meeting in June, inflation data has shown some improvement, but overall economic activity has been somewhat mixed. The Fed is likely to view the balance of risks between controlling inflation and supporting employment as roughly equal.\n\nCore Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.6% year-over-year in June, and the three-month annualised rate was 2.3%. There may be some concern that not acting to lower rates could hurt confidence in the Fed's commitment to returning inflation to its 2% target.\n\nThe Fed's communication from this meeting might offer only tentative hints about a possible rate cut in September. This is mainly due to the amount of data that will be available before the next FOMC meeting on September 17-18. Two more inflation and job reports will be released before then, and these could significantly alter the economic outlook.\n\nIf the Fed signals a higher chance of a rate cut in September, it could lead to an increase in gold and stock prices.\n\nAmit Goel, Co-Founder and Chief Global Strategist at Pace 360, said, \"We believe the FED will convey a high probability of a rate cut in its September meeting. This should have a positive impact on the Indian market, which has been hovering near the magical 25,000 on Nifty for the last few days. We see a high probability of Nifty opening with a gap-up post FED and continue its march beyond 25,000 levels.\"\n\n\"With core PCE inflation at 2.6% year-over-year in June, and the three-month annualized rate at 2.3%, there could be pushback for fear of undermining confidence in the Fed's determination to bring inflation back to 2%,\" he added.\n\nSuman Bannerjee, CIO at Hedonova, said, \"Despite a slowdown in inflation and strong economic growth, the Fed is likely to keep rates unchanged while hinting at possible cuts in September. A surprise rate cut this week could boost market performance, but this seems unlikely since inflation remains above the 2% target and Fed Chair Jerome Powell is known for his cautious stance. Investors should brace for possible market swings as the Fed's future economic outlook will be crucial in shaping market expectations.\"\n\nOverall, while the Fed's decision will be closely watched, the focus will be on hints about future rate cuts and the impact of upcoming economic data.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congress of Industrial Organizations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/us-federal-reserve-meeting-31221438-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=_XiinKnimqDAWJz6gLj7CnpD1dz4vWyC", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 993, "textEnd": 1008}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 94, "textEnd": 101}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

But a growing crowd of economists -- among them, former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder and Nobel prize-winner Paul Krugman -- are urging central bankers to cut now rather than at September's meeting, when it is widely expected to do so.\n\nAs Blinder put it in his Wall Street Journal op-ed this week: \"Why wait?\" But there's an equally strong case to be made for the opposite question: Why not wait?\n\nThe argument Blinder and other economists are making is: If you're on track to cut in two months anyway, central bankers should get it out the door sooner rather than later because monetary policy comes with what's referred to as long and variable lags. In other words, it takes time for the Fed's actions to be felt across the economy.\n\nThe Fed raised interest rates to their highest level in more than two decades to intentionally slow part of the economy and get inflation back down to the central bank's 2% target after it soared to a 40-year high in 2022.\n\nInflation still remains above target, but just by a smidge. So, leaving rates this high for even longer in hopes that it will help get inflation down a bit more risks hurting the economy more than helping it.\n\nIf all that keeps up, the economy could weaken even more substantially.\n\nBut it's far from doom and gloom out there at the moment.\n\nThe economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter of this year, exceeding economists' expectations, all while inflation continued to retreat closer to the 2% target -- a combination that's historically rare.\n\nAnd even though the unemployment rate is rising employers are continuing to hire more than 100,000 workers a month.\n\nAt the same time, March's Consumer Price Index report, which showed annual inflation unexpectedly jumped to 3.5%, is a reminder that there's no guarantee price hikes will stay on their current path.\n\nThat's why Torsten Slok, Apollo Global's chief economist, is maintaining his prior forecast that the Fed won't cut rates at all this year.\n\n\"There are still two more CPI releases before the September 18 [Fed] meeting, so we have to wait and see if the downtrend in inflation continues,\" he told CNN. \"With solid job growth and solid consumer spending, we think the current market pricing of three cuts this year is wrong.\"\n\nUniversity of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith also believes it's too early to start cutting now. \"With the economy running stronger than expected, it doesn't seem there should be an urgency for rate cuts,\" he said in a Tuesday note. If it were up to him, the Fed wouldn't start cutting until \"well into 2025.\"\n\nThe chances of that happening are about as high as getting a blizzard in the middle of the summer, though.\n\nFed officials have signaled that September will be when they finally lower interest rates. If they end up doing that, no one should lose sleep over whether central bank officials should have made that move in July or waited until November or December -- assuming the economy maintains more or less the status quo.\n\nThe difference between a few months for that initial cut \"really doesn't matter unless there's some big shock that hits the economy in that time,\" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier this month. For instance, if the Fed were to cut rates at this month's meeting, and Iran were to go to war directly with Israel, causing energy prices to spike, the central bank would likely regret loosening its grip on the economy because it could foreseeably contribute to even higher inflation.\n\nWithout a shock like that, it's pointless to play a what-if game, Waller said.\n\nBut Waller acknowledged that the timing is significant for investors who bet on what the Fed's next move will be. \"Whereas we're looking at what's going to happen to the game as a whole, not just any play.\" And to them, he said, the decision boils down to \"when are the conditions right to go.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Its favored measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labor market has come into better balance.\n\nDespite the improved economic picture, the Fed is not expected to make its first rate cut at the conclusion of a two-day policymakers' meeting on Wednesday, High Frequency Economics (HFE) chief US economist Rubeela Farooqi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nRecent comments from Fed officials \"suggest that they will remain on hold at their meeting... but have moved closer to a first interest rate cut,\" Goldman Sachs US chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published Friday.\n\nInstead, the Fed's rate-setting committee \"is likely to revise its statement to hint that a cut at the following meeting in September has become more likely,\" he said.\n\nAt the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.\n\nSince then, the data has painted a much better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 65 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.\n\nThose cuts are expected to come in the form of three quarter-point moves.\n\nThe markets now overwhelmingly expect the Fed's first move to come in September, and have assigned a chance of less than five percent that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will move on Wednesday.\n\n\"The case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is strong and we anticipate that it will use the July meeting to plant the seed that the first move in the normalization cycle is on the table for September,\" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in Washington earlier this month that recent data \"have shown some modest further progress\" against inflation.\n\n\"More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent,\" he added.\n\nPowell is unlikely \"to broadcast an exact date for when the FOMC may start lowering rates\" when he speaks to reporters later on Wednesday, Farooqi from HFE said.\n\n\"But he will probably acknowledge that inflation is moving in the right direction, and the FOMC is moving closer to gaining sufficient confidence to make the policy stance less restrictive,\" she added.\n\nPowell will have further opportunities over the summer to make the Fed's position clear -- including his keynote address to a gathering of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next month.\n\n\"We believe Powell will wait until Jackson Hole end August -- by which time the Fed will have another month's data -- to deliver the explicit September cut signal,\" economists at Evercore ISI wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nIf the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favoritism toward the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng -

Investors are eager to hear confirmation of at least one rate cut this year following the surprisingly cool June inflation reading. Will the stock market crash?\n\nWell, probably not.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has kept his cards especially close to the chest this year, typically offering standard sound bytes without overly committing to one path or another. That said, this time around presents a unique opportunity for Powell to, at the very least, set the stage for a rate cut in September, assuming the bank doesn't lower rates at this week's meeting.\n\nInterest rate traders are currently pricing in a roughly 95% chance the Fed opts to hold rates steady this time around, estimating just a 4% possibility of a 25 basis-point rate cut, per the CME FedWatch tool. As such, traders are fairly confident in the Fed's actual policy decision this week.\n\nConversely, traders believe there's an 89% chance of a 25 bp rate cut in September and a 10% chance of a 50 bp cut.\n\nInvestors have counted on a September cut for the better part of this year. The June consumer price index (CPI) report only furthered these expectations, showing a surprising 0.1% drop in prices in June.\n\nBecause of this, markets may be increasingly sensitive to Powell's commentary this week. If the Fed Chair even hints at the possibility the Fed holds rates steady in September, it may well prove bearish for stocks, which have already been on a tech-fueled slump lately.\n\nAll things considered, Fed officials have plenty to be optimistic about. Prices are clearly heading down, consumer spending -- the engine of the economy -- has held strong despite inflation and interest rate-related headwinds, GDP growth remains steadfast, and recession concerns have mostly disappeared from market sentiment.\n\nThat isn't to say the country is completely out of the woods yet, but that the Fed's \"higher for longer\" strategy may have proven just the medicine the economy needed.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shrey Dua did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Other aspects of the survey, like the quits rate, now down to 2.1, have edged back to pre-pandemic levels in what Fed officials view as an emerging balance between the supply and demand for workers. While the hiring rate has slowed, for example, the layoff rate has remained stable in a sign of companies holding on to workers.\n\nINFLATION (PCE released July 26; next release CPI Aug. 14):\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, used by the Fed to set its 2% inflation target, shows inflation slowly subsiding. It fell in June to a 2.5% annual rate, from 2.6% in the prior month.\n\nCore PCE prices, stripped of volatile food and energy costs, remained unchanged in June at 2.6%. Despite that reading, the data looks set to help Fed officials build more confidence that inflation is moving toward the U.S. central bank's 2% target.\n\nTraders maintained bets on a September rate reduction with about a 90% probability\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, the PCE index rose 0.1% while core PCE prices edged up 0.2%. Officials have begun to pay closer attention to signs of weakening demand in the economy as a precursor to a slowed pace of price increases.\n\nThe separate consumer price index released earlier this month fell in June by 0.1%, with drops in both volatile energy items and core consumer goods like vehicles, and weakness in housing costs that Fed officials have long been waiting to see. The 0.2% rise in shelter prices was the slowest since August of 2021, and overall it was the weakest CPI print since May of 2020.\n\nThe data pushed the annual rise in consumer prices down to 3% from 3.3% in the prior month, with the more volatile core index, excluding food and energy, falling to 3.3% from 3.4%.\n\nEMPLOYMENT (Released July 5; next release Aug. 2):\n\nU.S. firms added a greater-than-expected 206,000 jobs in June, but revisions to the prior two months knocked 111,000 positions from the previously estimated number of payroll jobs. That pushed the three-month average total payroll growth down to 177,000, below the level typical before the pandemic and a development likely to be taken by the Fed as further evidence the job market is slowing.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.1%, the highest level since Nov. 2021.\n\nFed officials have become more comfortable with the idea that continued job growth could still allow inflation to fall, especially if the supply of labor keeps growing and wage growth eases - as it did in June.\n\nThe number of people in a job or looking for work grew, and fewer people dropped out of the labor force - both healthy signs that nevertheless pushed up the unemployment rate. Average hourly wages meanwhile rose 3.9% compared to a year ago, versus a 4.1% annual increase in May.

Meanwhile, investors have poured nearly $6 billion into non-tech sector US exchange-traded funds, compared with just $1.4 billion that has flowed into tech ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence data show.\n\nFor the trend to continue, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will have to lay the groundwork for cutting interest rates in September following the most disruptive monetary policy tightening campaign in recent memory at his press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"This equity rally that's broadened may be turned upside down if the Fed doesn't signal it's cutting rates very soon,\" said Jimmy Lee, chief executive of the Wealth Consulting Group, whose snapping up tech and small-cap shares in anticipation of a September cut. \"If Powell doesn't stay stubborn, this bull market has more room to run.\"\n\nSome have even argued for a cut at this week's meeting after the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - the core personal consumption expenditures price index - climbed by just 2.6% in June from a year ago, near the central bank's 2% target. But Wall Street isn't betting on it.\n\nA year has come and gone since the Fed last raised rates, keeping borrowing costs stable while central bankers wait for signs that inflation is being tamed. If the Fed is about to begin a rate reduction cycle, stock bulls have history on their side. In the six prior hiking cycles, the S&P 500 Index has risen an average 5% a year after the first cut, according to calculations by the financial research firm CFRA. What's more, the gains also broadened, with the small-cap Russell 2000 Index climbing 3.2% 12 months later, CFRA's data show.\n\nIt's been a wild ride since the Fed began its tightening campaign to tame inflation in March 2022, with the S&P 500 climbing 29% since then. But it was hardly a straight climb. After a brutal stretch two years ago that plunged the equities benchmark into a bear market, it has rebounded to all-time highs and traded above 5,600 for the first time ever, fueled by the frenzy surrounding artificial-intelligence.\n\nPrice pressures appear mostly contained at this point. Traders now fear that if the Fed doesn't reduce borrowing costs it risks stoking turmoil in the banking sector while curtailing credit in crucial corners of the US economy. In the 1970s and again during the dot-com bubble, overly restrictive monetary policy, among other things, hurt the economy.\n\nDuring the last seven tightening cycles, the average time from the final rate hike to the first cut was 9.2 months, per Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. At 12 months since the Fed's last hike in July 2023, this span is already longer.\n\nAll of which makes the road tougher for traders trying to game the rotation out of Big Tech with August and September, historically the worst months for stock returns, coming up. The Fed meeting arrives during the same week earnings are expected from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., with analysts projecting their profit growth is poised to slow.\n\nWhile another $1.2 billion was funneled into US small caps last week, according to EPFR Global, not everyone is buying that its rally - or the rotation theme - has legs. To Jeff Rubin at Birinyi Associates Inc., the moves look like a typical correction, with the Nasdaq 100 Index down 7.4% from its July 10 high.\n\n\"Rate cuts would need to be aggressive for those smaller companies to benefit,\" said Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. \"And we just don't see that happening with the economy strong.\"\n\nHistory shows that buying stocks at the end of hiking cycles is a winning strategy in relatively low-inflationary environments, like the 1990s. But when monetary easing comes in the wake of inflationary pressures, like the 1970s, stocks fall in the three months after the last hike, according to Bank of America Corp.\n\nThat's why Powell's commentary this week is critical to the tug-of-war between bulls and bears, who are expecting him to at least hint at when to expect lower rates.\n\n\"Traders are pricing in action by the Fed very soon,\" said Eric Beiley, executive managing director of wealth management at Steward Partners Global Advisory, who is pulling money out of growth shares and pouring it into large-cap value and small-cap stocks that trade at attractive valuations. \"It's important officials act, or else stocks will be vulnerable in a seasonally weak and volatile time.\"", "source": {"uri":

On the other hand, the expectation of a September cut zooms to 85.8%, according to the data.\n\nIn its battle to curb inflation to within the 2% target, the Fed has raised rates to its current 23-year-high level.

When the Fed buys assets - primarily U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities - it does so with money created out of thin air. Those assets go on the balance sheet and the new money gets injected into the economy.\n\nBefore the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, the balance sheet was just over $900 billion. By the end of the pandemic era, it stood at just under $9 trillion.\n\nIn other words, the Fed pumped over $8 trillion into the economy in 14 years.\n\nDuring the pandemic alone, the Fed expanded that balance sheet by nearly $5 trillion.\n\nWarsh outlined the effects of this unprecedented monetary expansion.\n\n\"The monetary base is up 60 percent since the pandemic. Another measure of money, M2, is up 36 percent in the past four years. The inflation surge in the same period- cumulatively about 22 percent- shouldn't have been a surprise.\"\n\nIt shouldn't have been a surprise because this massive increase in the money supply is, by definition, inflation. This monetary inflation is the root of the price inflation we're still suffering from today.\n\nIf expanding the money supply is inflationary, it logically follows that to truly beat down price inflation, the Fed needs to shrink the balance sheet. Rate hikes aren't enough to ring all the liquidity out of the economy. Walsh made this very point in his op-ed, explaining that if the Fed is serious about taming inflation, it needs to significantly reduce the size of the balance sheet. In other words, it needs to undo the money creation of the past decade-plus.\n\nThe Fed did make a half-hearted effort to shrink the balance sheet. Since the pandemic peak, the central bank has run off about $1.76 trillion. That sounds like a lot until you remember that it added almost $5 trillion in just two years.\n\nAnd now the central bankers at the Fed have already started tapering the balance sheet.\n\nThe plan wasn't exactly ambitious to begin with.\n\nThe Fed announced a balance sheet reduction plan in March 2022 when it could no longer convince everybody that price inflation was \"transitory.\" It called for $30 billion in US Treasuries and $17.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities to roll off the balance sheet in June, July, and August of 2022. That totaled $45 billion per month. The Fed said it would increase the pace to $95 billion per month in September 2022, capping the U.S. Treasury roll-off at $60 billion.\n\nIf the Fed followed the blueprint, it would take 7.8 years for the Fed to shrink its balance sheet back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThat doesn't even begin to account for the inflation it created after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nSo, if inflation isn't at the 2 percent target why did the Fed start winding down balance sheet reduction in June?\n\nProbably because they learned their lesson in 2018.\n\nWhen then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke launched the first round of quantitative easing (QE) at the onset of the Great Recession, he assured Congress that the Fed was not monetizing debt. He said the difference between debt monetization and the Fed's policy was that the central bank was not providing a permanent source of financing. He said the Treasuries would only remain on the Fed's balance sheet temporarily. He assured Congress that once the crisis was over, the Federal Reserve would sell the bonds it bought during the emergency.\n\nThat didn't even begin to happen until late 2017. And it abruptly stopped in the summer of 2019 having made very little progress in keeping Bernanke's promise.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the monetary tightening was about to break the economy and the financial system.\n\nThe stock market crashed in the fall of 2018 and there were recession warning signs flashing in the economy. The Fed put rate hikes on hold in December that year and started cutting rates in 2019. In August 2019, the Fed reversed course on balance sheet reduction and launched a new round of quantitative easing as the short-term lending markets went haywire. Fed officials refused to call it QE. They even denied that it was QE. But whatever you want to call it, the result was the same as QE. The balance sheet began to expand again.\n\nThe Fed was able to shrink the balance sheet more this time around because the monetary expansion was bigger and faster during the pandemic than it was in 2008. But the central bankers know they're playing with fire. They know that this economy can't run without easy money. And that's exactly why they've already slowed their roll even though they continue to claim inflation isn't dead yet.\n\nKeep this in mind as you digest all the talk-talk-talk surrounding the July FOMC meeting. The mainstream talking heads and the markets will focus on \"will they or won't they\" cut rates. But the Fed has already loosened monetary policy. And it wasn't all that tight to begin with.\n\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see quantitative easing back on the scene in the near future. The national debt just eclipsed $35 trillion. Uncle Sam is going to need the Fed to get back into the Treasury buying business to support all of the borrowing.\n\nSo, what's the bottom line?\n\nThe Federal Reserve has already waved the white flag. It has surrendered to inflation.", "source": {"uri": "fxstreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXStreet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Money supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warsh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debt monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Bernanke"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Macroeconomics/CentralBanks/FED/federal-reserve-bank-60556630_Large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-08-", "textStart": 4438, "textEnd": 4449}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, investors have poured nearly $6 billion into non-tech sector US exchange-traded funds, compared with just $1.4 billion that has flowed into tech ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence data show.\n\nFor the trend to continue, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will have to lay the groundwork for cutting interest rates in September following the most disruptive monetary policy tightening campaign in recent memory at his press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"This equity rally that's broadened may be turned upside down if the Fed doesn't signal it's cutting rates very soon,\" said Jimmy Lee, chief executive of the Wealth Consulting Group, whose snapping up tech and small-cap shares in anticipation of a September cut. \"If Powell doesn't stay stubborn, this bull market has more room to run.\"\n\nSome have even argued for a cut at this week's meeting after the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the core personal consumption expenditures price index -- climbed by just 2.6% in June from a year ago, near the central bank's 2% target. But Wall Street isn't betting on it.\n\nA year has come and gone since the Fed last raised rates, keeping borrowing costs stable while central bankers wait for signs that inflation is being tamed. If the Fed is about to begin a rate reduction cycle, stock bulls have history on their side. In the six prior hiking cycles, the S&P 500 Index has risen an average 5% a year after the first cut, according to calculations by the financial research firm CFRA. What's more, the gains also broadened, with the small-cap Russell 2000 Index climbing 3.2% 12 months later, CFRA's data show.\n\nIt's been a wild ride since the Fed began its tightening campaign to tame inflation in March 2022, with the S&P 500 climbing 29% since then. But it was hardly a straight climb. After a brutal stretch two years ago that plunged the equities benchmark into a bear market, it has rebounded to all-time highs and traded above 5,600 for the first time ever, fueled by the frenzy surrounding artificial-intelligence.\n\nPrice pressures appear mostly contained at this point. Traders now fear that if the Fed doesn't reduce borrowing costs it risks stoking turmoil in the banking sector while curtailing credit in crucial corners of the US economy. In the 1970s and again during the dot-com bubble, overly restrictive monetary policy, among other things, hurt the economy.\n\nDuring the last seven tightening cycles, the average time from the final rate hike to the first cut was 9.2 months, per Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. At 12 months since the Fed's last hike in July 2023, this span is already longer.\n\nAll of which makes the road tougher for traders trying to game the rotation out of Big Tech with August and September, historically the worst months for stock returns, coming up. The Fed meeting arrives during the same week earnings are expected from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., with analysts projecting their profit growth is poised to slow.\n\nWhile another $1.2 billion was funneled into US small caps last week, according to EPFR Global, not everyone is buying that its rally -- or the rotation theme -- has legs. To Jeff Rubin at Birinyi Associates Inc., the moves look like a typical correction, with the Nasdaq 100 Index down 7.4% from its July 10 high.\n\n\"Rate cuts would need to be aggressive for those smaller companies to benefit,\" said Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. \"And we just don't see that happening with the economy strong.\"\n\nHistory shows that buying stocks at the end of hiking cycles is a winning strategy in relatively low-inflationary environments, like the 1990s. But when monetary easing comes in the wake of inflationary pressures, like the 1970s, stocks fall in the three months after the last hike, according to Bank of America Corp.\n\nThat's why Powell's commentary this week is critical to the tug-of-war between bulls and bears, who are expecting him to at least hint at when to expect lower rates.\n\n\"Traders are pricing in action by the Fed very soon,\" said Eric Beiley, executive managing director of wealth management at Steward Partners Global Advisory, who is pulling money out of growth shares and pouring it into large-cap value and small-cap stocks that trade at attractive valuations. \"It's important officials act, or else stocks will be vulnerable in a seasonally weak and volatile time.\"\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

At 4.1%, the unemployment rate is at its highest level since February 2018, though it is still historically low.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that while layoff activity remains subdued, the hiring rate in the economy has slowed to a level not seen since 2014. The percentage of unemployed workers who've gone without roles for 27 weeks or more has recently begun to surge, with about 1.5 million total workers now in that category.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fed's pressured inflation gauge hit 2.5% in June, the lowest reading since March and the third time it had hit that mark this year. The Fed's official target is 2%.\n\nIn recent testimony to Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that central bank officials had started the clock on lowering rates, saying acting \"too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve helps set the interest rates that determine how much it costs consumers and businesses to borrow money for products and services.\n\nFor the past two years, it has sought to fight inflation by keeping interest rates elevated, in essence fighting fire with fire: By making borrowing more expensive, it has cooled demand in the economy and thus slowed the rate at which prices have increased.\n\nNow, the Fed is signaling that the higher rates have done their job on the inflation front -- and that keeping them aflame could lead to unnecessary damage to the rest of the economy.\n\nWall Street traders have signaled for weeks that a September rate cut is a virtual certainty, according to data from the financial services company CME Group.\n\nBut influential former Fed officials have begun calling for a more rapid timeline. Bill Dudley, a former New York Federal Reserve president, wrote this month that a rate cut should occur before September. In a Bloomberg News op-ed, Dudley said he had \"changed his mind,\" with unemployment creeping higher and with all but the wealthiest households having depleted their immediate post-pandemic financial cushions.\n\n\"Although it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk,\" Dudley wrote.\n\nThis week, Alan Blinder, a Fed vice chair in the Clinton administration, said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that the time to cut is now.\n\n\"Why wait?\" Blinder asked, declaring the two-year fight against pandemic-induced inflation over as \"the economy seems to be simmering down.\"\n\nCutting rates would only be a matter of heading off a negative economic outcome: Companies have signaled that there's upside, too.\n\nSectors whose success is especially sensitive to interest rates and consumer credit, like the housing and automotive markets, have shown particular weakness -- including signals from companies in those industries that they expect sales to ramp up again once interest rates begin to fall.\n\n\"There is now a higher probability of interest rate relief beginning in September,\" said Dave Foulkes, CEO of Brunswick Corp., a boat-making specialist. While new cuts would most likely have only a minor impact on 2024 results because peak season will have passed, they'd be \"a potential tailwind for 2025.\"\n\nThe Fed will announce the results of the Open Market Committee meeting at 2 p.m. Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Blinder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Blinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CME Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hY01DoB_Ilwdj.sZkHdj1Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_nbc_universal_184/551dee6b78897572ba3a7f54d7572dbf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-02-", "textStart": 544, "textEnd": 557}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Traders are increasingly concerned that tech firms aren't yet seeing returns from heavy investments in artificial intelligence. The results will set the scene for reports from Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. later in the week, with markets also gearing up for the Federal Reserve decision Wednesday.\n\n\"It's likely the Fed does signal that looming cut and given the recent pullback, that should help this rebound continue,\" said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report. \"However, if the Fed does not signal a September rate cut, markets could get a bit ugly given recent tech weakness, especially if earnings underwhelm.\"\n\nWhile the Fed is expected to hold benchmark rates at the highest level in more than two decades this week, traders will be closely watching for any hints that the start of policy easing is near. In the run-up to the decision, data showed US consumer confidence rose in July on an improved outlook for the economy. Job openings came in above forecast last month.\n\nThe S&P 500 hovered around 5,460. A gauge of the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps fell 0.5%. The Russell 2000 of small caps gained 0.4%. Microsoft Azure is investigating reports of issues connecting to Microsoft services globally. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. climbed ahead of its results. PayPal Holdings Inc. soared on a bullish outlook. Procter & Gamble Co. sank on a sales miss.\n\nTreasury 10-year yields were little changed at 4.17%. The yen weakened as the Bank of Japan kicked off a two-day policy meeting. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda will be under intense scrutiny Wednesday when he unveils his plans for quantitative tightening and delivers a decision on the policy interest rate.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said one or two Fed rate cuts later this year are looking increasingly likely, after predicting just two months ago there would be no rate reductions in 2024.\n\n\"One or two cuts in the fall seems more likely,\" Solomon said Tuesday in a CNBC interview from Paris. \"There's no question there are some shifts in consumer behavior, and the cumulative impact of what's been kind of a long inflationary pressure, even though it's moderating, is having an effect on consumer habits.\"\n\nA year has come and gone since the Fed last raised rates, keeping borrowing costs stable while central bankers wait for signs that inflation is being tamed.\n\nIf the Fed is about to begin a rate reduction cycle, stock bulls have history on their side. In the six prior hiking cycles, the S&P 500 has risen an average 5% a year after the first cut, according to calculations by the financial research firm CFRA. What's more, the gains also broadened, with the small-cap Russell 2000 Index climbing 3.2% 12 months later, CFRA's data show.\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.",

According to analysts, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the rate-setting authority in the US, is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.50 per cent on Wednesday, while laying the foundation for a rate cut in September.\n\nThe US central bank has been holding the interest rates for the past one year since July 2023. Before that, between March 2022 and July 2023, the US Federal Reserve raised the interest rates by 525 basis points to control inflation, which hit a multi-decade high amid the Ukraine-Russia war and COVID restrictions.\n\nA basis point is 100th of a percentage point.\n\nNow, as the retail inflation in the US has fallen steadily closer to the Fed's 2% target for the past several months, there are expectations that the US Fed will start cutting interest rates from September 2024 to push economic growth. After today, the FOMC meeting will take place on September 17-18.\n\nThe last interest rate cut in the US took place in March 15, 2020.\n\nAccording to the latest data, yearly inflation in the US fell to 2.5% in July. The separate latest data showed that the US economy also grew faster than expected at 2.8 per cent in the second quarter solid gains in consumer spending and business investment. The Q2 GDP growth was double the 1.4% growth pace in the first quarter.\n\nWhy Is US Fed Expected to Keep Rates Unchanged Today?\n\nThough the inflation rate in the US has come under control at 2.5 per cent in July 2024 as against a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, experts believe that the US Fed will wait for two more months before start cutting rates as July 2024 will be a bit soon to cut rates as inflation is still yet to come under 2 per cent target.\n\n\"While I don't believe we have reached our final destination, I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted,\" Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said earlier this month.\n\nHow Will It Impact Indian Markets?\n\nThough the status quo on rates tonight will not impact the markets majorly, the US Fed's commentary on the possibility of rate cut in September is likely to be supportive for markets in India.\n\nA fall in interest rates will positively impact Indian markets in two ways -- first, it will boost US growth which will positively impact India's IT sector and other exports; and secondly, it will make the US dollar cheaper to boost India's rupee in comparison and boost capital inflows here.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/us-fed-meeting-2024-05-986004bde6d8776ef0842e4777b808ca-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 1070, "textEnd": 1085}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-15", "textStart": 1139, "textEnd": 1153}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The decision will be announced via a post-meeting statement at 2 pm in Washington. Fed chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.\n\nPolicymakers are likely to acknowledge that inflation has made progress towards their 2 per cent goal - a prerequisite for rate cuts - following tame readings on consumer prices for the month of June. With unemployment also edging higher, officials will probably indicate it's appropriate for policy to become less tight soon.\n\n\"I think that they are going to change the language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting,\" said Subadra Rajappa, head of US rates strategy at Societe Generale. She pointed to recent comments from New York Fed president John Williams, who \"has said that they are looking to move away from restrictive territory - so they could use that sort of language as well\".\n\nAll economists surveyed by Bloomberg are looking for no change in rates at this meeting. In their statement, policymakers are likely to highlight the improved inflation outlook. Instead of saying there has been \"modest\" progress, as they did in June, the FOMC could say there has been \"further progress\".\n\nThe committee could also say it has gained some additional confidence that inflation is moving to the 2 per cent target, a signal that it expects rate cuts soon.\n\nWhile investors put the odds of a rate cut this week at under 5 per cent, officials may at least discuss the possibility at the meeting. A number of prominent voices have recently argued the case for a July move, including former Fed vice chair Alan Blinder, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius and former New York Fed president William Dudley.\n\nSome economists said they will be watching to see whether Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee, a leading dove, will become the first policymaker in more than two years to cast a dissenting vote against the official decision. Goolsbee will vote this week as an alternate following the retirement of Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester in June.\n\nPowell is likely to be pressed by reporters on the outlook for the next meeting in September, as well as the pace of easing for the rest of this year and next. While he will probably welcome recent good news on inflation, he may also fall back on the Fed's standard language that its policy path will be \"data dependent\" and the central bank is plotting moves \"meeting by meeting\".\n\nThe chair is also set to be quizzed on his level of concern about a cooling labour market and what would constitute an \"unexpected weakening\" that would call for a response. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 per cent, is up from a low of 3.4 per cent in early 2023. Data for July will be published on Friday.\n\nAt the moment, investors are pricing in slightly more than a quarter-percentage point of easing for September, indicating they see some risk of a bigger cut than the typical 25 basis-point increment. They also see cuts in November and December as likely, according to futures.\n\n\"Powell could be asked about what would meet the bar for the 'unexpected weakening' that makes them reassess whether quarterly 25 basis point cuts are enough,\" said Derek Tang, an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics.\n\nWhile Powell may again be asked about the November presidential election, he's almost certain to repeat his standard line that politics plays no role in the Fed's rate decisions.

A too-weak signal, where a rate cut hinges on the data 'evolving as we expect' in the context of lingering attentiveness to inflation may not sound satisfactory to the bulls.\"", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_sor@markets.businessinsider.com", "name": "Jennifer Sor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Morrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66aa377caab37011780bee15?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

That would be the last meeting of the Open Market Committee before election day -- just in time to give an election eve boost to the Democrats, who gave Americans the inflation that is still 50 percent above the Fed's own target.\n\nThe Fed, of course, was playing coy -- call it a scrip tease. Scrip meaning the irredeemable electronic paper ticket money that, by government fiat, is the medium of exchange in our economy. The Fed alone employs hundreds of economists to figure out what the scrip is signaling. Which is what one has to do if one fails to feature the fact that Federal Reserve notes have lost more than 98 percent of their value in gold, just since the end of Bretton Woods in 1971.\n\nThat's when President Nixon severed the dollar's historic link with gold. Before that, the dollar had a fixed value under law in terms of gold -- a 35th of an ounce. Since then the fiat dollar's gold value has plummeted. In today's trading it trades for less than a 2,400th of an ounce. The gold standard had imposed a discipline on both the Fed, limiting its monetary manipulations, and the government, limiting its ability to spend and borrow to excess.\n\nThe result has been a national debt that just soared above $35 trillion and shows no sign of falling any time soon. As for the Fed, in recent years it has held interest rates to artificially low levels in an effort to stimulate the economy, prompting an asset bubble, while racking up more than $7 trillion, at last count, on its balance sheet under its Quantitative Easing scheme. Such is the monetary muddle America faces as the November election nears.\n\nIn the race for the White House, the likely Democratic candidate, Vice President Harris, is neck and neck with President Trump and all eyes are on the economy, especially with the Fed meeting this week. Central bank watchers will parse the Fed's statement Wednesday for a glimpse of the economic auspices. For months, voices on the left have pushed the Fed to cut interest rates, despite its failure to get inflation below its own 2 percent target.\n\nBack in January, Paul Krugman insisted \"the war on inflation is more or less over, and we won.\" At that point the Consumer Price Index was up by 3.1 percent over the prior year. That hardly constitutes victory over inflation, especially considering that under the gold standard in its heyday annual inflation was held to an average of but 0.1 percent a year. June's inflation reading came in at 3 percent. That hardly suggests the need to rush on cutting rates.\n\nThe Fed has held back despite the rising calls to cut. This could reflect caution, as Ms. Shelton noted when she raised this issue, to preserve \"the presumption of independence\" between the Fed and \"the economic agenda of the White House.\" She conceded it might be \"crude to ask,\" but wondered when will \"the grumbling begin\" that the Fed \"could end up choreographing an economic boost that serves to help the incumbent presidential candidate.\"\n\nAfter all, she noted, it wouldn't be a first for a Fed chairman to be \"suspected, rightly or wrongly, of using monetary stimulus to swing an election.\" She points to Arthur Burns, who \"allegedly sought to juice economic performance under pressure from the Nixon administration.\" Such policies -- along with closing the Gold Window -- fostered the stagflation of the 1970s, which was vanquished by President Reagan and Paul Volcker.\n\nWhich brings us back to the Trump-Harris race. While the Fed seems to be itching for a rate cut that could help grease the skids for Ms. Harris' candidacy, Trump urges delay at least until November. Political calculations aside, there is wisdom in seeing that inflation falls below the Fed's target before the central bank acts. Failure to do so risks a resurgence of the inflation President Biden unleashed, which could hobble the presidency of whoever takes office in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "new_york_sun@nysun.com", "name": "New York Sun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judy Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scrip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Note", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Note"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medium of exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bretton Woods system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973\u20131975_recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1973\u20131975 recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_F._Burns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthur F.

At 4.1%, the unemployment rate is at its highest level since February 2018, though it is still historically low.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that while layoff activity remains subdued, the hiring rate in the economy has slowed to a level not seen since 2014. The percentage of unemployed workers who've gone without roles for 27 weeks or more has recently begun to surge, with about 1.5 million total workers now in that category.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fed's pressured inflation gauge hit 2.5% in June, the lowest reading since March and the third time it had hit that mark this year. The Fed's official target is 2%.\n\nIn recent testimony to Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that central bank officials had started the clock on lowering rates, saying acting \"too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve helps set the interest rates that determine how much it costs consumers and businesses to borrow money for products and services.\n\nFor the past two years, it has sought to fight inflation by keeping interest rates elevated, in essence fighting fire with fire: By making borrowing more expensive, it has cooled demand in the economy and thus slowed the rate at which prices have increased.\n\nNow, the Fed is signaling that the higher rates have done their job on the inflation front -- and that keeping them aflame could lead to unnecessary damage to the rest of the economy.\n\nWall Street traders have signaled for weeks that a September rate cut is a virtual certainty, according to data from the financial services company CME Group.\n\nBut influential former Fed officials have begun calling for a more rapid timeline. Bill Dudley, a former New York Federal Reserve president, wrote this month that a rate cut should occur before September. In a Bloomberg News op-ed, Dudley said he had \"changed his mind,\" with unemployment creeping higher and with all but the wealthiest households having depleted their immediate post-pandemic financial cushions.\n\n\"Although it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk,\" Dudley wrote.\n\nThis week, Alan Blinder, a Fed vice chair in the Clinton administration, said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that the time to cut is now.\n\n\"Why wait?\" Blinder asked, declaring the two-year fight against pandemic-induced inflation over as \"the economy seems to be simmering down.\"\n\nCutting rates would only be a matter of heading off a negative economic outcome: Companies have signaled that there's upside, too.\n\nSectors whose success is especially sensitive to interest rates and consumer credit, like the housing and automotive markets, have shown particular weakness -- including signals from companies in those industries that they expect sales to ramp up again once interest rates begin to fall.\n\n\"There is now a higher probability of interest rate relief beginning in September,\" said Dave Foulkes, CEO of Brunswick Corp., a boat-making specialist. While new cuts would most likely have only a minor impact on 2024 results because peak season will have passed, they'd be \"a potential tailwind for 2025.\"\n\nThe Fed will announce the results of the Open Market Committee meeting at 2 p.m. Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Blinder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Blinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CME Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Fed-on-track-for-first-post-pandemic-rate.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-02-", "textStart": 427, "textEnd": 440}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Central bankers will meet about rates again on Nov. 6-7, just days after the election.\n\nIf they lower interest rates before the vote, there is a risk that Republicans will cast it as a politicized move meant to help Democrats: Lower borrowing costs can bolster the economy and markets. Former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, has already said the Fed should not be cutting rates leading up to November.\n\nBut central bankers have been clear that they plan to set interest rates with an eye on inflation and job market data, while trying to ignore the election entirely. Fed officials have been keeping interest rates high to bring inflation under control, and now that price increases have come down notably and the job market is cooling, they are slowly pivoting toward rate cuts to make sure they don't slow the economy too much and cause a recession.\n\n\"Their actions are going to be guided by the right thing to do from the perspective of monetary policy,\" said Karen Dynan, a professor at Harvard who was the chief economist at the Treasury Department during the Obama administration.\n\nIncumbent politicians would generally prefer to have low interest rates, which can help the economy grow more strongly. President Biden has mostly avoided commenting on monetary policy out of respect for the Fed's independence from the White House, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, recently said he had not met with the president in the past two years. But other prominent Democrats have been publicly urging Fed officials to cut rates.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump called for lower rates regularly when he was president, he has repeatedly suggested that any move to cut them before the election would be a politicized bid to help Democrats. In a recent interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, he called a rate reduction before the Nov. 5 election \"something that they know they shouldn't be doing.\"\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to win, one big question is whether he would approach the Fed the way he did during his first term as president -- regularly and loudly criticizing the central bank -- or whether he would go further, potentially trying to fire Mr. Powell before his term expires. Whether a Fed chair can actually be fired is unclear.\n\n\"I would let him serve it out, especially if I thought he was doing the right thing,\" Mr. Trump said in his Businessweek interview. While that suggests the former president isn't planning to fire Mr. Powell, Mr. Trump's wording hints that he thinks dismissing the Fed leader is a choice.\n\nIf Democrats win the White House in November, the Fed could see more continuity. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has said relatively little about inflation and monetary policy. But she was on board as vice president when the Biden administration crafted its economic policy stance.\n\n\"We're likely to see a similar approach,\" said Bharat Ramamurti, who served as the deputy director of the National Economic Council for manufacturing, innovation and domestic competitiveness from 2021 to 2023 during the Biden administration. \"That would be my guess.\"", "source": {"uri":

But before they close up shop, the meetings of the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will be closely scrutinized. Monetary policy decisions have become, along with artificial intelligence, the great drivers of the market.\n\nThe main focus will be on America's central bank. Although in recent weeks former New York Fed President Bill Dudley has spoken out in favor of a rate cut, market consensus continues to point to September as the most likely moment for the price of money to go down. Fed funds futures (financial futures contracts based on the federal funds rate) give a 107% probability to this scenario. Fran\u00e7ois Rimeu, a senior strategist for Credit Mutuel AM, believes that a reassuring inflation outlook and a labor market back in balance could open the door to a less restrictive monetary policy, but that more evidence of disinflation is still needed. This expert expects Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lay the groundwork for future rate cuts in September. \"We believe the Fed will communicate monetary easing more clearly at the next meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of August,\" he stresses.\n\nWith unemployment above 4% for the first time since 2021, many investors believe that the Fed should have already lifted its foot off the accelerator and joined the trend initiated by the European Central Bank last June when it implemented the first cut in the price of money in eight years. However, the institution considers that the labor market is at its optimum point and that, although the upturn in inflation experienced at the beginning of the year was temporary, disinflation will be slower than expected in the coming months.\n\nThe main medium-term risk is the November presidential election. The withdrawal of Joe Biden from the presidential race and the possibility of Kamala Harris being nominated as the Democratic candidate at the convention to be held between August 19 and 22, has caused Donald Trump to lose support. However, there is still a risk that the Republican tycoon will return to the White House and put a sharp increase in import tariffs back on the table.\n\nRaphael Olszyna-Marzys, an international economist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable AM, points out that a 10% tariff on imported goods as proposed by Trump would add 1.5% to prices for one year. In other words, it would increase price pressures and limit the Fed's room to act. \"Powell will avoid commenting on political developments,\" Olszyna-Marzys remarks. Nevertheless, the expert is optimistic that the Fed will lower rates in the U.S. twice this year (September and December) and cut rates once per quarter in 2025.\n\nThe economy remains resilient, but the fear of recession has not been completely overcome. Giles Mo\u00ebc, chief economist at AXA IM, recommends that to avoid having to embark on a rapid succession of rate cuts later and avoid a derailment, it would be advisable to start the process well in advance. \"Powell can escape criticism if he telegraphs the cut in September clearly enough this week and makes it clear that it would only be the start of a series of cuts,\" he notes. This would involve making it clear that the June dot plot has become obsolete. In the latest projections, the Committee downgraded the rate cut for this year from three to one.\n\nThe only discordant voice is Philip Orlando, chief equity strategist for Federated Hermes. \"Historically, the Fed prefers to avoid making a change in monetary policy between Labor Day (May 1) and Election Day. Especially if the decision is close and it can afford the luxury of patience,\" he notes. That is just the current scenario. In the second quarter, GDP defied all forecasts and grew by 2.8%, a far cry from the 1.4% at the start of the year. The expert points out that, if you combine the trend in the labor market and inflation with the toxic political environment, the Fed will cut rates after the election. \"We expect a 0.25% cut at the Nov. 7 and Dec. 18 appointments,\" he notes. Looking ahead to 2025, the expert expects a 1% cut for the year as a whole, which would bring the upper band of rates to 4%, down from 5.5% today.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Safra_Sarasin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

That's how it has managed to bring an impressive 79% return since our official launch in November - which compares to a much smaller 28.28% return for the S&P 500.\n\nThe next monthly rebalancing for August is tomorrow.\n\nSubscribe now for less than $8 a month as part of our summer sale and start beating the market today!\n\nThe Fed is anticipated to leave its Fed funds target range unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it has been since July 2023.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThis decision aligns with the U.S. central bank's cautious approach, reflecting growing confidence in the progress made on inflation while remaining vigilant about labor market conditions.\n\nWhile the Fed is all but certain to hold rates steady in July, the communication from FOMC officials and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely foreshadow a potential rate cut in September.\n\nThe FOMC is expected to revise its statement to reflect the improvements in inflation conditions and acknowledge rising risks in the labor market. This revision will likely hint that a rate cut in September has become more likely.\n\nAll eyes will then turn to Chairman Powell, who will hold a closely watched press conference at 2:30 PM ET as investors look for fresh clues on how he views the economy and inflation trends.\n\nPowell is expected to emphasize increased confidence in achieving the Fed's inflation goals, highlighting significant progress in combating inflation.\n\nAt the same time, Powell's remarks on the weakening labor market will be key, as he is likely to stress that the Fed remains data-dependent and will adjust its policy accordingly.\n\nThe unemployment rate has been inching higher, reaching 4.1% in June, up 0.1 percentage points for three consecutive months. This trend indicates rising slack in the labor market and declining job growth, adding weight to the argument for a rate cut.\n\nAs inflation cools and labor market conditions deteriorate, the central bank appears poised to pivot towards a more accommodative stance.\n\nMark your calendars for September 18, as it could be the day the Fed announces its first rate cut since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.\n\nAny indications or shifts in the Fed's tone during the meeting could trigger significant market movements and investor sentiments. A rate cut in September would mark a significant shift in the Fed's policy stance, which has been focused on combating inflation through aggressive rate hikes over the past two years.\n\nTaking that into consideration, market participants are advised to remain vigilant, exercise caution, and diversify portfolios to hedge against potential market fluctuations.\n\nTo navigate the current market volatility I used the InvestingPro stock screener to build a watchlist of high-quality stocks that are showing strong relative strength and have healthy growth prospects.\n\nThe InvestingPro advanced stock screener empowers investors to make informed decisions by providing a comprehensive analysis of undervalued stocks with the potential for significant upside in the market.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nReaders of this article can subscribe to InvestingPro for less than $8 a month as part of our summer sale.\n\nI regularly rebalance my portfolio of individual stocks and ETFs based on ongoing risk assessment of both the macroeconomic environment and companies' financials.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 3002, "textEnd": 3014}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 3120, "textEnd": 3130}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Investors anticipate a reduction during the Sept 17-18 meeting, depending on economic data. Recent statistics show resilience in job market and above-trend economic growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is anticipated to hold interest rates steady following its two-day policy meeting, indicating a possible reduction in borrowing costs as soon as September.\n\nInvestor sentiment, as reflected in contracts tied to the U.S. central bank's policy rate, suggests a rate cut at the September 17-18 meeting. The debate lies in whether the Fed will opt for a quarter-percentage-point or a half-percentage-point cut, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The policy rate has remained in the 5.25%-5.50% range for the past year.\n\nA more aggressive 50-basis-point cut would likely require clear signs of a rapidly slowing economy, which could jeopardize the current 4.1% unemployment rate. Despite rapid rate hikes over the past two years to combat inflation, the economy has performed better than anticipated, with recent data showing ongoing strength.\n\nThe economy grew at a robust 2.8% annual rate in the second quarter. Job market data from Tuesday indicated continued strength, with over 8 million job openings and decreased layoffs. The quitting rate and the ratio of unemployed to open positions align with pre-pandemic levels, suggesting balanced supply and demand for workers.\n\nNancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics, noted, \"The labor market has cooled but isn't weak,\" suggesting the Fed will be cautious and likely start cutting rates in September. The next policy statement will be released at 2 p.m. EDT, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nAnalysts expect Powell to stress a 'data-dependent' approach, given the time lapse before the next meeting, starting with the Labor Department's employment report for July, due Friday. Economists predict firms added around 175,000 jobs this month with steady unemployment figures. Recent data indicates slowing inflation, with PCE price index rates hovering near target.\n\nTim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, stated, \"The Fed does not believe it needs to hurry\" with cuts, as current data suggests normalization rather than drastic economic slowdown.

While you shouldn't expect a rate cut, here are some clues to look for.\n\nIf the central bank interprets inflation data as cooling substantially, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could drop hints toward a future interest rate cut in September. During the post-meeting press conference, Powell's language is often decoded by economic experts. Look for references to \"moderating\" or \"easing\" monetary policy as opposed to \"tightening.\"\n\nIn an attempt to rein in runaway inflation, the Fed hiked the federal funds rate 11 times since early 2022. The current target range of 5.25% to 5.5% is the highest it's been in 20 years.\n\nWhile just one interest rate cut won't significantly alter the cost of borrowing, it could signal more rate cuts down the road. Lowering interest rates on a consistent basis could finally bring some relief to those looking to take out a new loan or mortgage or trying to pay off high-interest credit card debt.\n\nCheck back with our live blog all day for complete coverage of the Federal Reserve meeting as well as Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/5e82e11e69f29e9b2eb269957886195e7878d050/hub/2024/07/30/e7489a16-05c2-4a2f-8deb-7ff5d8afb4cf/promo.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Taimur Baig answers", "body": "But I think that the market has priced that and the much bigger interesting questions are for 2025 because you have two possible candidates with very different likely reaction function with the US economy and their policies and their impact on inflation would be very different.\"Hence, I think that discussing what the Fed would do this week or in September I think is almost like a rear-view mirror discussion and what the Fed would do in 2025 and how the Fed signals that sitting here in July, August of 2024 is the big source of complication and uncertainty,\" says Taimur Baig, MD & Chief Economist, DBS Bank.\n\nShould we expect anything meaningful or different from Fed this week or it is going to be more of the same?\n\nTaimur Baig: There is a series of considerations for the Fed, which is making its life complicated going forward. So, on base case basis, of course, interest rates are likely to come down, there will be some signals given about that, that perhaps by the time the next meeting comes around September rate cut is likely and imminent.\n\nBut I think that the market has priced that and the much bigger interesting questions are for 2025 because you have two possible candidates with very different likely reaction function with the US economy and their policies and their impact on inflation would be very different.\n\nHence, I think that discussing what the Fed would do this week or in September I think is almost like a rear-view mirror discussion and what the Fed would do in 2025 and how the Fed signals that sitting here in July, August of 2024 is the big source of complication and uncertainty.\n\nThe markers which Fed uses, one is inflation, second is GDP. GDP is strong, inflation is projected to go lower. Now, are they getting both the sides right finally?\n\nTaimur Baig: Well, the Fed's projections is that inflation is heading toward 2% over the medium term. So, none of the rate cut decisions that are likely to transpire this year would be predicated upon a declaration of victory over inflation coming down to what the Fed would prefer.\n\nRather the motivation would be 5.5% Fed funds rate is too high given where the economy is. Not that, this is the beginning of a long interest rate cut cycle because we have conquered inflation, rather given where inflation is and growth is likely to be both let us say well below 3% more in the two-and-a-half handle that would not justify an unchanged monetary policy stance.\n\nSo, we are going to bring it down 25 in September, Christmas gift in December, so end the year at five and there still may be room to cut further in 2025.\n\nNow, your question was, has the Fed gotten it right? Well, the future is the future. There are lots of models, lots of smart economists sitting at the Fed making lots of projections. Sometimes they come out right, sometimes they do not and we at the market are guilty of the same. So, whether the Fed gets it right or not is a question of the secondary order. The primary order is, are they able to give the market adequate signals and forward guidance to keep financial conditions stable that is the absolute critical question.\n\nAnd there, in my view, they are doing the right job and we look at volatility markers, we look at market pricing, everything is stable that is what counts.\n\nA quick word as well on the kind of indicators that we are seeing on the political arena and what that could potentially mean with the US elections fast approaching when it comes to the stock markets in the US?\n\nTaimur Baig: So, three big issues -- taxes, tariffs and immigration. And in all these three things, the Harris camp and Trump camp have very-very different views. We will expect to see heightening of immigration regardless of Trump or Harris. But the way it will be done would be so much more aggressive under Trump and so much more, let us say, rules based and not ad hoc under Harris that we will see the economy in the market being forced to adjust in very different ways under the two different presidents.\n\nSame with taxes, where Harris wants to make the system more progressive. Trump wants to make the system more regressive by giving more tax cuts to the corporate sector, as well as making some of the tax cuts for the very wealthy permanent and that, of course, has inflationary implications.\n\nAnd, of course, in tariff we know that it is not like under Biden tariffs have come down, but they are unlikely to go higher under Harris, whereas under Trump almost certainly he is going to entertain substantially higher tariffs.\n\nSo, tariff and taxes have inflationary implications, whereas the issue related to immigration over time could have inflationary implications. But in all three cases, I would expect to see the fixed income market, as well as the US dollar react very differently under probability of Trump getting elected higher or probability of Trump getting re-elected lower.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBS_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DBS Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_guidance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward guidance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ad hoc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regressive tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112155122,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-40128,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Kevin Mohatt / Reuters file\n\nFederal Reserve officials have begun contemplating cutting interest rates for the first time in the post-pandemic period as their focus shifts from surging inflation to a steadily weakening job market.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting Tuesday amid mounting signs that economic growth, while still on seemingly stable footing, is slowing. At 4.1%, the unemployment rate is at its highest level since February 2018, though it is still historically low.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that while layoff activity remains subdued, the hiring rate in the economy has slowed to a level not seen since 2014. The percentage of unemployed workers who've gone without roles for 27 weeks or more has recently begun to surge, with about 1.5 million total workers now in that category.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fed's pressured inflation gauge hit 2.5% in June, the lowest reading since March and the third time it had hit that mark this year. The Fed's official target is 2%.\n\nIn recent testimony to Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that central bank officials had started the clock on lowering rates, saying acting \"too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve helps set the interest rates that determine how much it costs consumers and businesses to borrow money for products and services.\n\nFor the past two years, it has sought to fight inflation by keeping interest rates elevated, in essence fighting fire with fire: By making borrowing more expensive, it has cooled demand in the economy and thus slowed the rate at which prices have increased.\n\nNow, the Fed is signaling that the higher rates have done their job on the inflation front -- and that keeping them aflame could lead to unnecessary damage to the rest of the economy.\n\nWall Street traders have signaled for weeks that a September rate cut is a virtual certainty, according to data from the financial services company CME Group.\n\nBut influential former Fed officials have begun calling for a more rapid timeline. Bill Dudley, a former New York Federal Reserve president, wrote this month that a rate cut should occur before September. In a Bloomberg News op-ed, Dudley said he had \"changed his mind,\" with unemployment creeping higher and with all but the wealthiest households having depleted their immediate post-pandemic financial cushions.\n\n\"Although it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk,\" Dudley wrote.\n\nThis week, Alan Blinder, a Fed vice chair in the Clinton administration, said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that the time to cut is now.\n\n\"Why wait?\" Blinder asked, declaring the two-year fight against pandemic-induced inflation over as \"the economy seems to be simmering down.\"\n\nCutting rates would only be a matter of heading off a negative economic outcome: Companies have signaled that there's upside, too.\n\nSectors whose success is especially sensitive to interest rates and consumer credit, like the housing and automotive markets, have shown particular weakness -- including signals from companies in those industries that they expect sales to ramp up again once interest rates begin to fall.\n\n\"There is now a higher probability of interest rate relief beginning in September,\" said Dave Foulkes, CEO of Brunswick Corp., a boat-making specialist. While new cuts would most likely have only a minor impact on 2024 results because peak season will have passed, they'd be \"a potential tailwind for 2025.\"\n\nThe Fed will announce the results of the Open Market Committee meeting at 2 p.m. Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Banking,_Housing,_and_Urban_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Blinder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Blinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CME Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240729-jerome-powell-al-1215-864c20.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 96, "textEnd": 102}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-02-", "textStart": 560, "textEnd": 573}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Inflation has gradually cooled over recent months and the labor market continues to soften.\n\nTraders forecast no rate adjustments until September, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. Betting markets like Polymarket and Kalshi anticipate the same.\n\n\"For the Fed to alter their stance at this meeting materially would be a bit shocking,\" said Byron Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments.\n\nMost Fed officials have signaled that they aren't ready to lower rates just yet. Rarely does the central bank make any surprise decisions.\n\n\"With markets already pricing in slightly more than 25 basis points worth of cuts in September, the Fed may find it hard to push back against these expectations,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, at the September 18 meeting, CME data as of Tuesday shows odds spiking to about 85 percent for a quarter-point move lower.\n\nBond markets have seen a sharp rally over the last three months, in line with the cooling economic data. That's making the Fed's job easier--and it's raised concerns that the Fed should start cutting rates sooner than later.\n\nProponents of an early cut point to the rise in corporate bankruptcies, stress in commercial real estate, and pain among consumers.\n\nThe Fed will announce its policy decision at 2 p.m. ET today, and Powell will speak at 2:30 p.m. ET. Odds are, he will talk around and about a September cut without committing to one explicitly.\n\n\"We will be listening for changes in his language, particularly any emphasis on inflation versus a slowing economy,\" said Paul Karger, the co-founder of wealth management firm TwinFocus. \"More language on a slowing economy is bullish for bonds as it's more certain that the economy slows than that inflation stabilizes.\"", "source": {"uri": "inc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inc.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_rosen@inc.com", "name": "Phil Rosen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barclays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wealth management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Micromarketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Micromarketing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/w_1024,h_576,c_fill/images/panoramic/getty_2161551481_vpk55h.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 1154, "textEnd": 1166}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Central bankers will meet about rates again on Nov. 6-7, just days after the election.\n\nIf they lower interest rates before the vote, there is a risk that Republicans will cast it as a politicized move meant to help Democrats: Lower borrowing costs can bolster the economy and markets.

This increase is driven by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions and anticipation of the Federal Reserve's policy decision. The killing of a Hamas leader in Iran has further bolstered gold's appeal, setting the metal on course for a monthly gain as traders look towards potential U.S. interest rate cuts.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting is expected to provide crucial insights into future interest rate policies. While the central bank is anticipated to keep short-term rates unchanged, there is widespread speculation about potential rate cuts starting in September. Recent favorable inflation data has led market participants to believe that the Fed might lay the groundwork for such cuts during this meeting.\n\nMarket pricing indicates a strong likelihood of the Fed approving its first rate reduction in over four years at the September 17-18 meeting. The benchmark funds rate has remained at 5.25%-5.5% for the past year. Traders are closely watching for any signals from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that could hint at future rate cuts, given the absence of major economic disruptions.\n\nMichael Reynolds, VP of Investment Strategy at Glenmede, suggests that the Fed will maintain rates but will likely hint at possible September cuts. Similarly, Goldman Sachs economists predict that subtle changes in the Fed's language could signal a move towards easing monetary policy, driven by improved inflation data.\n\nRecent economic reports indicate a mixed but generally positive outlook. The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed a decline in job openings, while ADP's private payrolls report and other employment data are awaited for further clarity. Despite these mixed signals, the overall economic environment remains conducive to potential rate cuts, supported by easing inflation and strong GDP growth.\n\nGold's recent performance and current market conditions suggest a bullish outlook. The metal benefits from both geopolitical uncertainty and expectations of a weakening U.S. dollar, which makes gold more attractive to foreign buyers. As the Fed's meeting concludes, any indications of forthcoming rate cuts will likely further support gold prices. Traders should watch for key economic data releases and statements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell for additional market direction.\n\nIn summary, gold prices are set to remain buoyant as safe-haven demand persists and expectations for Fed rate cuts grow. The combination of geopolitical tensions and economic indicators pointing towards monetary easing provides a supportive backdrop for gold's continued strength.", "source": {"uri": "fxempire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXEmpire.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hyerczyk@fxempire.com", "name": "James Hyerczyk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2024/07/Gold-Blue-10.jpg?func=cover&q=70&width=700", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-17", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 969, "textEnd": 984}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Act on the news with POLITICO Pro.\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers will likely hold interest rates steady when they meet today. But that's not why market participants or Beltway economists are holding their breath.\n\nInstead, they'll be watching for any sign from Fed Chair Jerome Powell about how central bank officials are thinking about the possibility of rate cuts in September and beyond as a growing number of indicators point toward softening inflation and a weaker labor market.\n\nMarket participants are almost 100 percent sure that is what's in store for September, according to CME's FedWatch tool. But that would mark the first time the Fed has cut rates this close to an election since October 2008 -- a little more than a month after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.\n\nPowell has repeatedly said the Fed does not consider politics when it makes a decision on rate policy. But the political implications of what he and his colleagues do next -- and Fed officials no doubt hate that we're bringing this up -- are enormous.\n\nFrom Victoria Guida: \"Former President Donald Trump recently told Bloomberg News that cutting rates just weeks before the election is 'something that [central bank officials] know they shouldn't be doing,' while multiple Republican lawmakers have also suggested that such a move could raise questions of political bias. At the same time, standing pat -- when markets overwhelmingly expect Fed policymakers to act in September -- would also open them up to criticism.\"\n\nTrump has a lengthy history of making his opinions known when it comes to rate policy. But he's hardly the only Republican to make the point that a September rate cut would raise questions about election interference. Both Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who sits on Senate Banking, and Kentucky's Rep. Andy Barr, who could be the top Republican on House Financial Services next year, made that point in separate interviews with POLITICO.\n\nIt usually takes quite a bit of time for the Fed's rate decisions to have an impact on macroeconomic indicators like the unemployment rate or price growth. But a September move would be a clear signal that the Fed believes its long-running battle against inflation has concluded and that the public can now anticipate lower borrowing costs.\n\nThat could breathe life into a dormant housing market and reduce the interest charges Americans pay on auto loans and credit card bills. It would also reduce the cost of financing merger activity, something investment bankers and private equity firms have craved for months. Put another way, it would provide a boost to markets and consumers as Vice President Kamala Harris makes the case for four more years of Biden-era economic policies.\n\nThe White House has made a point of staying away from any conversation about what the Fed should do. But Harris allies -- including administration alums like Bharat Ramamurti, Jennifer Harris and Kitty Richards -- this week said the Fed should not wait until September to start cutting rates.\n\n\"At this point, the Fed's interest rate policies are actually contributing more to the cost of living problem that American families are facing than inflation,\" said Richards, a former Treasury official who's now a senior strategic adviser at Groundwork Collaborative. \"That's largely because most American families do not buy houses in cash. They do not buy cars in cash, and they put some significant amount of consumer spending -- at least temporarily -- on credit.\"\n\nIt's impossible to say with 100 percent certainty what the Fed will do next. But no matter the path Powell & Co. take, Democrats or Republicans will be furious.\n\nIT'S WEDNESDAY -- Soft landings aren't supposed to be so hard. Send tips and suggestions to [email protected].\n\nSenate Banking will hold a hearing on infrastructure and public transportation investments at 10 a.m. ... The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. ... Powell holds a press conference at 2:30 p.m.\n\nHarris's Full Nelson -- Puck's Julia Ioffe reports that Brian Nelson, Treasury's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, will lead the Harris campaign's policy team. Nelson was a top adviser to Harris when she was California's attorney general and helped lead the Biden administration's Russia sanctions efforts following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n-- A new Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll shows that Harris has wiped out Trump's lead in key swing states. Donor enthusiasm is surging, Hailey Fuchs and Jessica Piper report. Jarrett Renshaw and Nandita Bose of Reuters report that a VP pick could come as soon as Monday.\n\nProject 2025 founder steps down -- After being hammered by Democrats and disavowed by Trump, Paul Dans -- the director of the Heritage Foundation's controversial 2025 Presidential Transition Project -- is stepping down, Meridith McGraw and Daniel Lippman report. The project's policy agenda includes proposals that would significantly alter the Federal Reserve, including eliminating its dual mandate of achieving stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nSpeaking of the dual mandate -- The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that the number of job openings remained roughly flat in June. But as economist Guy Berger noted on X, the reported hiring rate of 3.4 percent is roughly comparable to late 2013 and early 2014 -- when the unemployment rate stood at nearly 7 percent (current unemployment is 4.1 percent). Reports of layoffs and workers quitting their jobs have also fallen, which points to this being \"a weird labor market -- nobody leaving, nobody coming in,\" he wrote.\n\n-- And it might not be a good type of weird. As The NYT's Jeanna Smialek reports: \"Policymakers are increasingly attuned to the possibility that conditions could deteriorate quickly, because weaknesses have begun to surface. Job openings have come down sharply, part-time employment is up, fewer companies are turning to temporary help to fill gaps and fewer workers are job hopping.\"\n\nUpdate on Goldsmith Romero -- After scrapping plans for a Wednesday vote, Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown told Eleanor Mueller that he hopes to hold a vote on CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero's nomination to lead the FDIC in September. \"She's had bipartisan support through her career, twice in big votes, so there's no reason it shouldn't be -- and this is an important job, and she's clearly qualified. I would think both parties would want to close that chapter with [current FDIC Chair] Marty Gruenberg and do this.\"\n\nSpeaking of Gruenberg -- Following up on yesterday's MM, Michael Stratford reports that the FDIC board is moving ahead with plans to step up oversight of investment firms that take stakes in banks. Gruenberg on Tuesday said the banking regulator would no longer rely on self-certifications that those investments are passive and that they would give examiners tools to \"analyze the ongoing interaction between an investor and the institution.\"\n\n-- Michael also scooped a new letter from Sen. Thom Tillis and all Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, including vice presidential nominee JD Vance, saying the lawmakers are making a new push to get the FDIC to drop its plan for stricter guidelines on how bank boards manage risk.\n\nThe FDIC last fall proposed new corporate governance standards aimed at beefing up the risk-management responsibilities of bank board directors. Proponents said it was a necessary response to the spring 2023 bank failures.\n\nBut the Senate Republicans wrote to Gruenberg that they're worried the plan \"seeks to micromanage Board affairs in a manner that will inject unnecessary uncertainty in key bank management activities.\" Industry groups and state regulators similarly oppose the new guidelines.\n\nStubHub targeted for \"junk fees\" -- District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb is suing the ticket marketplace StubHub for allegedly deceptive and unfair practices to hide mandatory fees from consumers, according to a copy of the complaint shared with MM. Schwalb alleges that the company's \"drip pricing\" model -- which uses a countdown clock as consumers go through the purchasing process before disclosing fees at the final step -- prevents consumers from comparison shopping.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type":

The most extreme scenarios are those in which political pressure prevents a rapid response to shocks.\n\nTrump has urged the Fed not to cut rates too early, as inflation is still too high. Many believe this means that a rate cut before the November election would not be warranted. That won't stop the Fed from cutting rates in September, but it's all the more important that it lays out its case methodically, which is why it's unlikely to cut rates too early at its meeting this week.\n\nMost investors believe that once in office, Trump would pressure the Fed to cut rates. The US president is likely to be aggressive, although the frontal attack on the Fed's independence that some potential Trump advisers have suggested is unlikely to materialize and would likely be stopped by rising bond yields and falling stocks if it did.\n\nAny political pressure would make it harder for the Fed to cut rates while preserving inflation credibility. Fed Chairman Jay Powell should keep his head down, focus on his job, and rely on Congress to provide some protection from executive power. But the Fed will still have to consider the potential impact of Trump's policy shocks.\n\nThe Fed's current summary of economic projections is de facto a Harris Limited Forecast. That's simply because it assumes no new shocks, which is likely in a scenario where Harris wins but is limited by a Republican Senate. But Trump is a disruptor. Changes in market prices indicate that investors believe Trump's trade, immigration, fiscal, energy, and deregulatory policies would be broadly reflationary, pushing nominal GDP and inflation higher.\n\nThe Fed thus faces a dilemma: update its monetary policy plans early in response to potential shocks, or wait and risk falling behind again. It seems likely that it will move toward a slow adaptation to potential shocks, updating its baseline forecasts after the election and only cautiously.\n\nThe Fed doesn't know who will win, has no say over what will be implemented, and will be acutely aware of the difficulty of modeling both the mechanical impacts and the effects on animal spirits and risk premia. It won't want to appear to be prejudging Trump's policies as inflationary during the election season. Fortunately, bond yields do some of its work for it, rising when Trump's chances of winning improve, which works against overheating.\n\nSome of Trump's tariff shocks are in principle one-off price-level shocks, not permanent inflationary shocks, although the Fed should consider the possibility that tariffs could interact with reduced labor supply due to migration and accommodative fiscal policy to generate more sustained inflationary pressure.\n\nIn the short term, the Fed has good reason to remain focused on inflation and employment data as they come out. But it would be unwise for it to completely ignore the potentially large shocks that are looming on the horizon.\n\nRather than changing its baseline view based on assumptions about who will win and what the consequences of its policies will be, the Fed should instead consider what level of interest rates would leave it well positioned in mid-2025 for a wide range of scenarios. These should include those dominated by Trump shocks, but also those conditioned by a Harris presidency. It should then carefully craft a rate path consistent with these assumptions.\n\nBased on current information, a good positioning in mid-2025 could mean a rate between 4 and 4.5%, significantly lower than the current rate of 5.25 to 5.5%, but still somewhat restrictive.\n\nIf the upcoming shocks are inflationary or if inflation is somewhat persistent, then the Fed could suspend rates or even slow down its monetary policy by raising rates in late 2025 if necessary. If the upcoming shocks and data are not inflationary, it could continue to cut rates or even accelerate. If we expect two rate cuts under the new chairman in the first half of 2025, that leaves room for two or even three in the remainder of 2024.\n\nOf course, no monetary policy can be frozen. If the labor market were to weaken further in the coming months, the Fed would have to respond aggressively. The priority would then be to salvage the soft landing and worry about possible Trump shocks later.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Powell_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Powell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deregulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fd801b984-07b5-474b-89f3-f095ab7a12dc.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

A group of policymakers within the Fed vote on those interest rate decisions: the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), all of which directly influence the economy and your wallet.\n\nThe Fed's interest rate decisions impact how much you may pay to borrow money and how much interest you earn when you save.\n\nHere's what the FOMC is, who's on it and why this group matters for your finances.\n\nThe FOMC is the group of Fed officials given the sole authority of voting on whether to raise, lower or maintain interest rates. The FOMC, specifically, is one of three branches within the Federal Reserve System (the FOMC, the board of governors and the 12 regional reserve banks).\n\nThe FOMC is made up of 12 members: the seven board of governors, the president of the regional New York Fed and four other Reserve Bank presidents located throughout the country. The board and the New York Fed president have permanent voting positions, while the four regional bank presidents rotate on and off the board annually.\n\nThe permanent members of the Fed's board of governors are:\n\nMeanwhile, the five other slots on the FOMC come from the 12 regional Fed banks.\n\nGoldman Sachs alumna Beth Hammack will officially assume the role of Cleveland Fed President on Aug. 21. Until then, the regional Fed bank's First Vice President Mark Meder will be serving as interim president.\n\nEven those who don't have a vote still have some influence. All 12 regional reserve bank presidents attend meetings, participate in policy discussions and contribute to the assessment of the economy just as much as other voting members in attendance, informing everyone on how well their regions are performing. Their projections are also included in the Fed's quarterly projections.\n\nThe chair of the board serves as the chair of the broader FOMC, a position currently served by Jerome Powell, whose second four-year term began in May 2022. Other former chairs include Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan.\n\nMost notably, the FOMC sets a key benchmark interest rate -- the federal funds rate -- that influences other borrowing costs throughout the financial system, such as credit cards and home equity lines of credit (HELOC) rates, as well as yields on savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs).\n\nFed officials consider a dual mandate -- stable prices and maximum employment -- when deciding to raise, lower or maintain interest rates. The FOMC also participates in what's called \"economic go-rounds\" during meetings, where each official shares what's happening in their individual regions.\n\nAfter each Fed meeting, the FOMC issues a policy statement that explains what officials decided to do and why. Three weeks after each meeting, records of that meeting known as minutes are published. Complete transcripts featuring word-for-word dialogue that took place during FOMC meetings are published five years later.\n\nUnder Fed Chair Jerome Powell's tenure, the FOMC also moved toward holding a press conference after each meeting, hosted by Powell. Previously, it held them every quarter.\n\nEvery other meeting, Fed officials submit individual economic forecasts for employment, gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation. They'll also mark down their projections for where interest rates are likely to go in the years ahead, in a chart known as the dot plot. Both of those reports make up the \"Summary of Economic Projections.\"\n\nBut the FOMC decides on more than just adjusting interest rates. It also conducts open market operations, where it buys and sells securities. That process, formally called large-scale asset purchases but more colloquially known as quantitative easing, can influence longer-term interest rates, while also expanding or contracting the money supply.\n\nThe FOMC typically meets about every six weeks, culminating in about eight meetings a year. Broader economic events could, however, prompt the Fed to meet outside of its original schedule.\n\nThat was the case during the financial crisis of 2008, as well as the coronavirus crisis in March 2020. Officials voted to reduce interest rates at two emergency meetings within 13 days of each other, bringing borrowing costs down to near-zero percent for the first time since the financial crisis.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is designed to be independent of government, though not independent from government. The Fed's board ultimately reports to Congress. Members are appointed by the president, approved by the Senate Banking Committee and then the broader Senate before coming to the Fed.\n\nThe regional reserve bank presidents, on the other hand, have more separation from Congress. A board of directors at each reserve bank, made up of local business contacts, leaders and experts, decides who ultimately serves at the helm. They're then approved by the Fed's board of governors.\n\nThe Fed has to reach a majority consensus for most of its decisions, but every expert may interpret economic data differently. Thus, many Fed watchers focus on the ideologies and priorities of each individual member -- often colloquially categorizing them as either \"doves\" or \"hawks.\"\n\nFed officials and their economic bias\n\nIf a voting board tends to be made up of more dovish members, it might indicate a lower interest rate policy in the year ahead. If that same voting body is more primarily composed of hawks, they might be more willing to raise interest rates at a faster pace.\n\nUltimately, however, the Fed describes itself as \"data dependent,\" deciding what to do with interest rates based on employment, inflation and growth data. It was hard for even doves to deny the need to raise interest rates as inflation pushed to the highest level since the 1980s. Since the Fed began raising interest rates to combat inflation in March 2022, just two officials have dissented -- but only about the size of those increases, not the validity of raising them at all.\n\nThose differing ideologies, however, could matter even more than usual as the Fed juggles what to do next with interest rates. An official who takes a hard stance on inflation may be more inclined to keep borrowing costs higher for longer, while a policymaker focused on protecting the job market might be more inclined to let up on the brakes.\n\nThe FOMC's decisions arguably impact your wallet more directly -- and more quickly -- than any other policymaker in Washington. What it decides to do can steer the broader economy away from recessions, while also influencing how much you pay to borrow and what you're paid to save.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com",

Bonds and gold climbed as traders rushed for safety amid geopolitical risks. Oil remained lower.\n\nIsrael's military struck Beirut, aiming at a Hezbollah commander, in response to a rocket attack on Saturday in the Golan Heights that killed 12 people. Most shares in the S&P 500 rose, but renewed tech weakness weighed on the gauge -- with Nvidia Corp. tumbling 6%. After a $2.3-trillion Nasdaq 100 wipeout, investors awaited Microsoft Corp.'s results amid concern that firms aren't yet seeing returns from artificial intelligence. Its numbers will set the scene for reports from other heavyweighs this week, with markets also gearing up for Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision.\n\n\"If the Fed does not signal a September rate cut, markets could get a bit ugly given recent tech weakness -- especially if earnings underwhelm,\" said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report.\n\nWhile the Fed is expected to hold benchmark rates at the highest level in more than two decades, traders will be closely watching for any hints that the start of policy easing is near. In the run-up to the announcement, data showed US consumer confidence rose on an improved outlook for the economy and job openings beat forecasts.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell about 1%. The Nasdaq 100 slid 1.5%. A gauge of the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps sank 2.5%. The Russell 2000 of small firms was little changed. Microsoft is investigating outages of some Office applications and cloud services. CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. plunged on a report Delta Air Lines Inc. hired an attorney after a tech outage. Procter & Gamble Co. sank on a sales miss. JetBlue Airways Corp. soared on a turnaround plan.\n\nTreasury 10-year yields declined three basis points to 4.14%.

Since the latest consumer price index print showed signs of cooling inflation, traders have stepped up their rotation out of Big Technology shares and into everything from small-capitalization stocks to value plays.\n\nIf the Fed is about to begin a rate reduction cycle, stock bulls have history on their side. In the six prior hiking cycles, the S&P 500 Index has risen an average 5% a year after the first cut, according to calculations by the financial research firm CFRA. What's more, the gains also broadened, with the small-cap Russell 2000 Index climbing 3.2% 12 months later, CFRA's data show.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said one or two Fed rate cuts later this year are looking increasingly likely, after predicting just two months ago there would be no rate reductions in 2024.\n\n\"One or two cuts in the fall seems more likely,\" Solomon said Tuesday in a CNBC interview from Paris. \"There's no question there are some shifts in consumer behavior, and the cumulative impact of what's been kind of a long inflationary pressure, even though it's moderating, is having an effect on consumer habits.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 Index has probably already logged the gains it will see this year, but the benchmark still presents ample opportunities for investors, according to Bank of America Corp.\n\nWhile neutral on the index overall, BofA's Savita Subramanian says there's potential for strong returns in a few areas: among dividend payers, \"old school\" capital-expenditure beneficiaries like infrastructure, construction and manufacturing stocks, and other themes that don't revolve around artificial intelligence.\n\n\"In mid-2023, sentiment was deeply negative and our toolkit suggested that the direction of economic and earnings surprises was more likely positive than negative,\" Subramanian, the firm's head of US equity and quantitative strategy, told clients in a note dated July 29. \"Today, sentiment is neutral and positive surprises are ebbing.\"\n\nThis

And analysts agree that today's meeting will be one of the most important in recent years. Kurt S. Altrichter, a financial advisor and founder of Ivory Hill, even describes today's FOMC meeting as the \"most important of your life.\" In a new post on X, Altrichter explains why.\n\nCentral to today's FOMC meeting is the Federal Reserve's potential indication of a September rate cut. According to Altrichter, the financial markets are almost unanimously anticipating this move, with Fed fund futures indicating a near-certain likelihood of such an outcome. \"Market expectation is a strong signal for a September rate cut,\" Altrichter points out, marking today's update as a pivotal moment for financial markets.\n\nThe key question for today is: \"How strongly does the Fed signal a September rate cut?\" the expert explains. Investors are directed to pay close attention to the FOMC's statement at 2:00 pm ET, especially the third paragraph, which could subtly signal the Fed's confidence in reaching its inflation targets.\n\nAltrichter advises, \"Look at the 3rd paragraph for this key sentence: The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\" Any modification in this wording would be a clear signal that the Fed is nearing its inflation control goals, potentially paving the way for rate adjustments.\n\nAltrichter outlines several potential outcomes from the meeting, each associated with specific market reactions. In a dovish scenario, the Fed signals a rate cut for September. Then, Altrichter expects a broad market rally, especially in sectors less sensitive to interest rates. \"Yields and the dollar should fall modestly with a modest rally in commodities,\" Altrichter predicts, suggesting significant movements in standard and sector-specific indexes.\n\nIn a hawkish scenario, there will be no change in the forward guidance by the US central bank. If the Fed maintains its current stance without hinting at future cuts, the markets might experience a downturn. \"Look out below and expect a sharp decline. SPX should fall by 1-2%,\" he warns, noting that tech and growth sectors might relatively outperform due to their appeal during higher yield periods.\n\nThe potential adjustments in US monetary policy bear direct consequences for the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Crypto, often viewed as alternative investments, reacts sensitively to shifts in monetary policy, particularly regarding interest rates.\n\nIf the dovish scenario materializes, this could make Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more appealing. A signal of lower future rates could drive increased investment into the crypto market, potentially leading to price increases as investors seek higher returns in alternative assets.\n\nConversely, should the Fed signal reluctance to cut rates, indicating a stronger economic outlook or concerns about inflation, this could strengthen the US dollar and increase yields on traditional financial instruments. Such an environment might lead to a pullback in the crypto markets, as the comparative advantage of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies diminishes against strengthening traditional yields.\n\nMax Schwartzman, CEO of Because Bitcoin Inc, commented via X: \"FOMC is [today] & its incredibly important as we get into the end of this fed cycle... Here is how the last 11 meetings have gone for Bitcoin...\"\n\nThus, today's FOMC meeting is a watershed moment for financial markets globally, with significant implications for both traditional and crypto markets. As Altrichter succinctly puts it, \"A Sept Fed rate cut has driven the 2024 bull market. Tomorrow's meeting will either reinforce that tailwind or refute it. If the Fed signals a cut, the rally continues. No signal: markets could get ugly.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbtc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBTC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_simmons@newsbtc.com", "name": "Jake Simmons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_adviser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial adviser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alternative investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comparative advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/shutterstock_2284599845.jpg?fit=3840%2C2160", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Come September, however, the CME FedWatch tool predicts a 4.1% chance of eased rates, as implied by 30-day futures prices. This probability is configured alongside a 12 to 13.8% chance of trimming basis points by 50 basis, instead of the usual 25.\n\nThis news comes with the recent dip in the consumer price index (CPI) in the US last June which brought the crypto market up after showing moderate inflation numbers at 3.3% year-on-year. Bets on Polymarket for the July 2024 decision show \"No Change\" at 96% odds.\n\nHowever, whether the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ultimately decides to hike or cut rates, a positive outcome for crypto is still predicted. A rate hike would mean a slower but steady improvement.\n\nA rate cut, on the other hand, would be bullish, given how lower interest rates typically reduce the cost of borrowing, encouraging more investment and liquidity in riskier assets like crypto. Additionally, lower rates have a tendency to weaken the fiat currencies, potentially driving investors to seek alternative stores of value such as crypto.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $65,600 level and continues its wobbling over the past month while equities remain resilient. But with the possibility of rate cuts come September, all directions point to a likely favorable outcome for crypto.\n\nThe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, and Bank of England are set to announce interest rate decisions this week, with analysts expecting divergent outcomes from each central bank.\n\nJapan's inflation has remained above the bank's 2% target, while the yen hovers near multi-decade lows against the US dollar.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady at its Wednesday meeting, but markets anticipate a clear signal of a rate cut at the next meeting in September. CME FedWatch data shows 100% odds for a September rate cut, with a 12% chance of a 50 basis point reduction instead of the typical 25 basis points.\n\nOn Thursday, the Bank of England (BOE) faces a closely watched decision, with economists and markets split roughly 50/50 on whether it will cut rates for the first time in several years. Even if the BOE does ease, it's likely to indicate a cautious approach to future cuts.\n\nThese central bank decisions come amid a broader trend of monetary easing among major economies. The European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have already implemented rate cuts in recent months, signaling a shift from the multi-year tightening cycle.\n\nFor the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, the impact of these decisions may be limited in the short term, barring any significant surprises. However, the long-term trend towards easier monetary policy could potentially benefit risk assets like Bitcoin.\n\nThis 56% year-to-date rally, while largely attributed to demand from US-based spot ETFs, may also reflect market anticipation of this easing cycle.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision comes days after a DOJ entity moved $2B worth of Bitcoin, present an intriguing juxtaposition in the financial and economic spheres.\n\nWhile the Fed is expected to hold rates steady and signal future cuts, potentially boosting risk assets like Bitcoin, the DOJ's large-scale transfer of seized crypto assets introduces an element of uncertainty into the market.\n\nThe timing of the DOJ's Bitcoin movement, just ahead of the Fed's announcement, raises questions about potential coordination or coincidence. If the Fed's decision aligns with market expectations of a dovish outlook, it could offset any negative pressure on Bitcoin's price caused by fears of government selling.\n\nConversely, if the Fed surprises with a more hawkish stance, it could compound any market jitters resulting from the DOJ's actions. This situation highlights how government actions across different domains - from monetary policy to law enforcement - may have interconnected effects on the crypto market.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Store of value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Anerican companies added the fewest number of workers since the start of the year and wage growth slowed, consistent with signs of a softer labor demand.\n\nFed officials are likely to move closer to lowering interest rates from a two-decade high this week by signaling a potential rate cut in September, though they may stop short of providing details beyond that. The decision will be announced via a post-meeting statement at 2 p.m. in Washington. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.\n\nTo Thierry Wizman at Macquarie, the Fed will need to \"thread a needle.\"\n\n\"A too-strong signal of a coming September rate cut may scare traders into thinking that the Fed sees abrupt economic weakness ahead,\" he noted. \"A too-weak signal, where a rate cut hinges on the data 'evolving as we expect' in the context of lingering attentiveness to inflation may not sound satisfactory to the bulls.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 1.3%.

experiencing very low levels of unemployment, that we've already started to see some acceleration and inflation that had begun.\n\nAt that point, wages have been rising fairly significantly, and we've seen this in response to the trump tax cuts and the stimulus associated with that.\n\nSo that was a panic in response to the collateral crisis.\n\nWe then have a very understandable panic associated with covid, followed by another panic that actually kicks in in 2022 when he begins hiking interest rates at a pace that candidly didn't even give the market time to adjust itself right.\n\nSo the companies that need to refinance have not actually yet approached their maturity wall or hit the maturity wall where they would experience those higher levels of interest rates.\n\nIt was just a very deep misunderstanding of the role of interest rates in controlling inflation.\n\nPeople love to Monday morning quarterback the Fed, right, this is This is a time tried and true.\n\nUm uh, past time here.\n\nSo I guess this brings us to now and what you think the Fed should be doing going forward.\n\nWell, I think that's what they should be doing, what they should have done.\n\nAnd actually, instead of Monday morning quarterbacking, I actually was out in July of 22 pointing out we'd already broken inflation.\n\nAnd if you pull up monthly inflation numbers, particularly on the P CE side, the EU discovered that this inflation on an elevated continuous basis above kind of 3% stopped in July of 2022.\n\nSo everything post the Russian invasion of Ukraine has largely been within the range of historical normalcy.\n\nWhat we have today is we have a situation in which, because very slow moving components that are mechanically designed to be slow moving things like owner equivalent rent, where you're incorporating a series of six month rental pools to capture the data associated with the housing market because you've actually treated the is effectively that the map becomes the territory right that the numbers are right, not what we're actually experiencing in the economy.\n\nThe Fed is way late to this process of cutting interest rates.\n\nWe're seeing this in terms of rising consumer stress.\n\nWe're seeing this in rising delinquencies, particularly for those of the lower strata of the incomes.\n\nUh uh, percentiles.\n\nAnd on the flip side of that equation, we're actually seeing households that are older that have accumulated resources.\n\nThey're suddenly blessed with an extraordinary amount of interest income that is sustaining everything from cruise lines to, uh, happy hour early dinners at Howard Johnson's, which I no longer no longer really exists.\n\nSo we're actually very much in a situation where the Fed has created an animal that it now needs to figure out how to address as well.\n\nMy hunch is, is we're gonna see another panic.\n\nLet me let me get so those are your thoughts broadly on the Fed and the economy.\n\nBut for viewers who are listening, right, Michael, Um, and they're invested in the stock market.\n\nWhat's your advice?\n\nWell, I think that there's two separate components.\n\nSo one is Remember what actually happens in 2022.\n\nFed begins hiking interest rates that hits the bond market that flows through to the stock market.\n\nNot because people are suddenly doing discounted cash flow analysis and saying, Hey, maybe Microsoft is worth less.\n\nWhat it's actually doing is lowering the value of their bond portfolios because it lowers the value of their bond portfolios.\n\nThey then have to sell equities by bonds to keep a fixed allocation.\n\nThis is how things like target date funds work, so we can very clearly see that that's ultimately we played through the minute we were done with that interest rate hiking cycle.\n\nThe minute we stopped hitting bond prices, equity prices began to recover, and today we see valuations at the same levels that we saw going into those events.\n\nThe level of interest rates has had no impact whatsoever.\n\nNow the Fed, of course, is turning around and saying, Hey, what happens if we begin to cut interest rates?\n\nWe can't do this right because that'll send NASA prices even higher.\n\nWell, it didn't affect it on the way up.\n\nI think it's unlikely to affect it on the way down, and if anything, those interest rate cuts could very much actually be a trigger for reduced income in that segment of the economy that has continued to spend.\n\nAnd so you just want to be really cautious and thinking that this is ultimately going to be some big asset boom that plays through.\n\nBy the time the Fed gets to the point where it's aggressively cutting rates, it's probably too late.\n\nMichael, I would love to keep talking, but we gotta go because Microsoft is out.\n\nBut thank you so much for coming in Really appreciate it.\n\nA really interesting conversation.\n\nLet's talk about Microsoft earnings from its fourth quarter just now crossing the wire and the stock is already falling here.\n\nThat's because intelligent cloud revenue remember our Dan Halley really pinpointed that number.\n\nIntelligent cloud.\n\nThat's where the copilot, uh, you know is is worked in here.\n\nThat a I enabled service 28.52 billion dollars 28.72 billion is what analysts had been anticipating.\n\nCloud revenue overall about in line with estimates perhaps slightly short of estimates and overall revenue of $64.73 billion was above the $64.52 billion estimate.\n\nBut it seems as though, really, Josh, It appears to be that intelligent cloud.\n\nAnd this seems to be the answer, at least initially could change that the market is taking Yeah, now, importantly, we don't have guidance for for Microsoft we're gonna get Usually you would hear Microsoft CFO Amy Hood give that on the conference call and that can obviously have a big impact on the stock.\n\nWe'll wait to hear those comments, the colour commentary in the forecast.\n\nBut yeah, you're right.\n\nI mean, investors as they kind of think through the A I SPAN on Microsoft.\n\nI'm just looking here from comments from C Sata Nadella putting kind of trying to put a kind of optimistic spin on this, saying, Listen, talks about strong performance this fiscal year, he talks about how that speaks to their innovation, the trust customers he says continue to place in in Microsoft.\n\nUm, but clearly at least the initial reaction here.\n\nDisappointment in the after hours.\n\nYeah, And in terms of their other business lines, by the way, productivity and business processes and more personal computing both of those actually beat estimates.\n\nRevenue and productivity and business processes was up 11% more personal computing rose by 14% and intelligent cloud was up 19%.\n\nWe're also, of course, gonna dig in and, of course, get more on the call on Capex.\n\nAnd that was huge because, um, what does CFO Amy tells you about what they're spending now and what they see spending ahead?\n\nI mean, how is that greeted when alphabet gave you those those numbers?\n\nIt was not greeted enthusiastically by investors now, and that is coming, by the way, the call that we keep referring to 5:30 p.m. eastern, where we're gonna get that forecast and more details on these other items.\n\nIn the meantime, let us also turn to another company reporting earnings that is Starbucks third quarter numbers hitting the wire here and showing bigger declines than estimated in the company's comps, but the shares are actually rising.\n\nLet's dig into it here.\n\nUh, so third quarter comparable sales overall globally down 3%.\n\nIs what analysts had been anticipating an international overall slumped more than had been anticipated.\n\nUh, adjusted earnings per share did beat estimates here in 93 cents, beating by a penny.\n\nSo unclear exactly what in here, uh, investors were happy about.\n\nWe're less upset about to send the shares up by 3.5% at least at first blush.\n\nActivists also involved in this one, Elliot Paul Singer and Elliott Management taking, um, an undisclosed stake.\n\nAnd some in the street have already kind of thinking through what?\n\nYou know, investors are kind of taking their their best guess.\n\nCould it mean they say, you know, invest more in leadership with kind of more Rachel restaurant experience.\n\nDo they Do they do they want to see a reduction in unit growth?\n\nUm, we'll see.\n\nBut certainly at least the initial reaction here.\n\nRachel weary the, um CFO in the statement talking about efficiency efforts tracking ahead of expectations.\n\nUm, she says, partially offsetting investments associated with the cautious consumer environment.\n\nSo maybe cost cutting is the Is something that investors like here.\n\nI mean, when it comes to Starbucks, there's one topic and one topic only that we've been talking about in our office, which is that our local Starbucks here in New York City has close very disappointing to me as a as a loyal Starbucks fan.\n\nAnd you're not the only one.\n\nThere's a lot of dismay in the office around this, but maybe that's part of the efficiency that they are referring to.\n\nI'm on air, which I'm very disappointed on because I'm not other option.\n\nSo the forecast for Q three they're saying 885 to 900 million.\n\nUh, in the case of Pinterest now, Pinterest, uh, year to date.\n\nSo it's not as though it was running up huge into this report.\n\nUm, you know the bill Red, the CEO in the statement, uh, talking about monetization efforts paying off, and advertisers seeing, uh, improved performance on Pinterest.\n\nUm, they're gaining share of advertising budgets that he talks about, and yet you do see this outlook, so hopefully we'll get some more comment on the call from this one as well.\n\nWe had.\n\nWe had talk interestingly this week with RB CS, um, Brad Erickson and he had done.\n\nHe had done some checks, which, and and Brad is Obviously he's a bull on the name.\n\nIt had looked mixed heading into traffic trending downward.\n\nI remember he talked.\n\nYeah, that that ad demand, I think you said, look fairly healthy.\n\nBut traffic at least on mobile again, according to his checks.\n\nNot so much.\n\nSo anyway, yeah, at least initially, the investor is very disappointed by the print.\n\nStarbucks just reporting mixed third quarter results.\n\nPlacer A i head of analytical research RJ Hoty joins us now with the reaction to the print RJ.\n\nIt's actually popping about 2% here in the after hours RJ.\n\nI mean, I think the U SI think a lot of investors were bracing for the worst after last quarter in terms of, uh, visitation trends.\n\nThey came in slightly better than at least the consensus numbers that I've seen, Uh, maybe a little bit of relief on that, uh, still negative, obviously, uh, negative six in terms of comparable transactions.\n\nUm, so this company still got some things to work out, but positive sequential momentum and maybe evidence that some of the things they're working on in terms of new product innovation in terms of discounting and value, uh, maybe paying off and driving more visits.\n\nSo initial reaction, Um, you know, still a lot of work to do for the company, but also some progress compared to last quarter.\n\nAnd what are your, uh what is your data showing you in terms of what are our people?\n\nHow are traffic trends?\n\nLooking at Starbucks and in terms of what people are spending as well.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo our data, if we adjust for the 5% new stores that are in the system compared to last year, uh, we're generally showing uh, visitation trends down year over year as well.\n\nBut the important thing, too, is that one of the things that the company focus on is bringing back more of the occasional users.\n\nAnd we did start to see a bit of progress on that as the quarter progress.\n\nSome of that wind up with the promotion, some of that lined up with some of the new summer beverages that they launch.\n\nWe are starting to see a little bit of encouraging that those kind of everyday kind of occasional users are starting to come back.\n\nUh, I wouldn't say it was, you know, in droves, but certainly some some positive momentum on that.\n\nAnd so, uh, the company continues to see more visitors than ever before.\n\nUh, just getting frequency, uh, encouraging more frequent visits, which I think a lot of the initials that they have have given time to play out.\n\nYou know, to the extent they have an undisclosed stake for for the journal, I'm just curious to the extent that they you know, they wanna see changes, you know?\n\nIf they do press for them, would you think they They may emphasise.\n\nYeah, And and Elliott is a smart group, too.\n\nSo, I, I I'm sure they've got some some big vision for for the company here, too.\n\nMy my thought is, um, really just kind of getting that.\n\nThat occasional user.\n\nUm, you know, we've seen Starbucks, uh, a lot more competition from the likes of Dutch, bro.\n\nSome of the more private, uh, coffee chains coming up even more competition from QSR and other channels as well.\n\nUh, more frequently to the I think that's kind of the big message.\n\nUm, you know, we've seen a lot of changes in consumer behaviour.\n\nThat's what our data shows.\n\nA lot more people coming into different day parts, people wanting different things, people wanting, uh, new innovation.\n\nAnd I think that Starbucks is starting to act upon that.\n\nBut maybe not to the same degree, Uh, that they need here too.\n\nSo, um, you know, probably more in terms of innovation.\n\nUh, the company talked about efficiency in the press release.\n\nThroughput during peak hours has always been an issue here.\n\nUh, that's another thing that I think they can work on better balance between the in store experience and the the digital mobile ordering app.\n\nUh, I think that's something that the, uh the company needs to look at.\n\nSo if I'm going through the checklist of probably what they're looking at, it's probably looking a lot like that.\n\nAnd it it's interesting, because when they said ambi see in the release, I think not only of throughput and like getting your coffee when you want your coffee and not encountering the scrum there, Um, but also them saving money.\n\nSo my question was sort of How do they, you know, be cost effective?\n\nWell, at the same time, improving on those things that you're talking about like innovation and, like throughput, it's It's a broad based effort, to be honest and II.\n\nI think the company has made inroads into some of the things they need to do there and really with the company.\n\nIf you think about it, it was built on the third place experience.\n\nIt was this place away from home and work and built on this experience.\n\nBut, you know, over the last decade, obviously convenience and mobile ordering has come in.\n\nAnd really, the company is trying to serve two different audiences at the same time the experience customer as well as a mobile ordering customer.\n\nAnd so I think a lot of that efficiency comes down to identifying what store serves what need.\n\nAnd so you might have an experience store, a larger format store or even one of the groceries and across the corner you may have a smaller format store, and I think some of the things they're doing in terms of mobile or mobile only pick up type locations.\n\nSmaller format.\n\nUm, I think you can start to better address consumer need states with the different locations that they have.\n\nAnd you know, when we do see similar, um, you know, locations located nearby, we do, and they clearly have a need state served.\n\nWe do see some positive, uh, or some really encouraging visitation trends when we look at that.\n\nSo that's one of the things I think they need to address here.\n\nYou know, RJ we talk about Starbucks, obviously the giant.\n\nYeah, we're seeing some positive, positive traffic trends.\n\nAnd to be honest, uh, Dutch Bros and many of its other competitors kind of in the drive through small box coffee space are generally outperforming the category and outperforming Starbucks at this time.\n\nI think some of this has to do with picking the right markets.\n\nDutch Bros. Is going into markets where we generally see underserved markets.\n\nSo kind of the Tennessee Missouri Oklahoma space generally underserved in terms of, uh, coffee visitation.\n\nSo I think that they're in the picking right markets.\n\nUh, they're also doing a good job, kind of addressing the move away from urban to more suburban and rural locations.\n\nUh, I've done a good job with that, but also good job with menu innovation.\n\nGood job with throughput.\n\nThey're they're kind of doing the things that Starbucks needs to look to, um, in terms of, uh, you know, just the whole package here.\n\nInnovation, experience, throughput, uh, doing a lot of things, right there.\n\nSo our data says some pretty encouraging numbers for, uh, for Dutch Bros. And a lot of their competitors.\n\nThose shares are rising after the company reported results for its second quarter and came out with a forecast that is being read positively as well, up about 3% here.\n\nSecond quarter adjusted earnings per share, beating by a penny at 69 cents, revenue at $5.8 billion also beating estimates, and the company now says for the third quarter its revenue should be 6.4 to $7 billion.\n\nThe estimate was $6.6 billion there, the company says.\n\nAlso, for the third quarter, its adjusted gross margin will be 53.5% which is a little bit lower than estimates.\n\nBut people looking on the bright side here in the statement they talked about the A I business continuing to accelerate and that they are well positioned to deliver strong revenue growth in the second half of the year, led by demand for some of their processors here.\n\nSo all of this, uh lending to some of the games that we're seeing in the after hours.\n\nYeah, just seeing some comments here by CO Lisa Sue says they delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter, driven by record data centre segment revenue.\n\nUh, says their A A I business continued accelerating.\n\nUh, well positioned, she says, deliver strong revenue growth in the second half.\n\nThe rapid advances in generative A I, she goes on to say, are driving demand for more.\n\nCompute every market, creating growth opportunities as we deliver a i solutions across our business.\n\nOverall revenue was up almost 9% Data centre revenue at $2.83 billion.\n\nAnd just like Intelligent Cloud was the most important thing for Microsoft Data Centre was the most important thing to watch for a MD, and in this case, they delivered.\n\nIt looks like that is what, um, investors are likely zeroing in on here.\n\nThe street's gonna be looking for on on what, Uh, what doctor?\n\nWho has to say about a I chip revenue.\n\nAlso, though, um, the overall PC market, how she sees that evolving as her own Dan Halley has pointed out the the boom during the pandemic.\n\nThen the slowdown now signs that it's it's It's on the rebound and, uh, gaming as well What she sees there.\n\nUm, you know, it'll be very interesting tomorrow, kind of which tech tech narrative takes hold.\n\nObviously, Microsoft is bigger than a MD.\n\nAnd so, even though a MD shares may hold up, are we going to see an infection to the rest of the tech tech space from Microsoft?\n\nOne other headline.\n\nI want to mention here that again our Dan Howley flagged as an indicator for Microsoft, the company saying A I services contributed eight points to azure revenue growth.\n\nNow that's been moving up incrementally, I believe, he said.\n\nIt was seven last time around, had moved up from six.\n\nSo it's sort of inching up there.\n\nIs that fast enough for you know what investors want?\n\nWho knows?\n\nUm, but it looks like that the the companies you know is is emphasising that part of of the business.\n\nListen, all eyes are on the call for Microsoft because we don't have a forecast yet.\n\nAnd so there's even more attention paid to what CFO a Amy Hood has to say about about the quarters ahead.\n\nWhat's interesting?\n\nNow, you've had two of the three Cloud Giants report, so we had Google, uh, report and disappointed.\n\nAnd now Microsoft reported and underwhelmed, at least initially.\n\nSo now we wait for the third one Amazon, see what they have to say.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd not to mention we gotta wait for Apple too, you know?\n\nI mean and all, even though it's on a cloud giant, obviously what it's going to say about a I go a word, um, you know, they're gonna try so hard on that call Julie to get anything from Tim Cook and Luca Maestri is the whole focus.\n\nObviously, on the Colby, they're gonna try to get some colour about the the next iPhone, which you would expect, uh, Mr Cook to take the stage of September and unveil.\n\nAnd of course, you're right.\n\nThe bulls were pinning a lot of hope on Well, it's an an a IA I enabled iPhone, and it's gonna drive this this big upgrade cycle.\n\nWe we'll see.\n\nWe can get out out of Apple on the conference call and, by the way, just checking on shares of those companies.\n\nAmazon is down almost 3% in after hours trading, most likely because of what we heard from Mac, Microsoft and Apple is down a little bit, just about a half a percent.\n\nSo when I talk about what's gonna be the bigger ripple effect, NVIDIA is the only one that's up.\n\nWall Street not expecting a rate cut this time around, but we'll be looking for any insight into a potential September cut following the decision.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell, of course, will be holding a news conference.\n\nThe Our finances coverage of the decision and news conference will start at 2 p.m. Eastern, moving over to earnings.\n\nIt will be another big day of results tomorrow we'll hear from Meta, Boeing and Qual.\n\nThat will be the fourth of the Magnificent seven to report this season.\n\nAnd analysts expect the tech Giants user growth to taper while a pricing an election, a spending drives sales growth will also be keeping an eye on second quarter earnings from Boeing in the morning and finally pending home sales data for the month of June coming out in the morning.\n\nThose are sales in which a contract has been signed, but the transaction has not yet closed.\n\nAfter seeing a 2% decrease in May, economists are forecasting a new print to show a 1.5% increase.\n\nOn the other side of the break, more coverage of Microsoft's earnings.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The U.S. central bank is expected to keep interest rates steady this week but could hint at relaxing its monetary policy stance as soon as September. Any September decision to lower the Fed's target range would be the first time interest rates have fallen since the hiking cycle began in March 2022. CNBC Pro analyzed stock market data over the past six tightening cycles since 1982, when the Federal Reserve switched to targeting the federal funds rate. The analysis found that, on four occasions the S & P 500 had risen by double digits within a year after a rate cut The analysis also revealed that the S & P 500 had set the direction of travel for annual returns within three months after a rate cut. When stocks rose, on average, they were up 6% in the quarter immediately after the cut and up 16% in the 12 months after the cut. However, stocks fell soon after the rate cut in 2001 and 2007 by 13.5% and 20.6%, respectively, due to the dotcom crash and the global financial crisis. Three months after the cut, the S & P 500 was down by 11% on average on those two occasions. The current tightening episode is the seventh in the past 40 years. Historically, the Fed has cut rates because the U.S. economy was heading into a recession or experiencing a notable growth slowdown. Uniquely, under current economic conditions, the Fed will be cutting when the economy continues to grow. The latest data shows that the U.S. real GDP increased at a 2.8% annualized pace adjusted for seasonality while inflation declined 0.1% month-on-month in June, putting the annual rate at 3% , around its lowest level in more than three years. While nominal rates peaked at 11.5% at the end of the 1983-84 episode, the current target range of 5.25%-5.50% is the highest this millennium. Rates peaked at 2.375% in the 2015-18 episode but were close to the current peak rate at the end of the 2004-06 episode at 5.25%. The current tightening cycle is also notable for being the most aggressive. The Fed's target range was raised by 525 basis points in roughly 17 months, \"thus larger than the cumulative increases in the other six episodes,\" according to Kevin Kliesen, economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ganesh_rao@cnbc.com", "name": "Ganesh Rao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_St._Louis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107428159-17182180762024-06-12t184650z_1454931514_rc2o98ajvrjr_rtrmadp_0_usa-fed.jpeg?v=1718221103&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

More importantly, the language in the communique was quite bullish on prices.\n\nThe BoJ officials said, 'underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify.'\n\nThe latter hinted that today's rate hike is certainly not the BoJ's last one. Now, all eyes are on BoJ Governor Ueda for further tips and hints. The Japan 10-Year JGP yield is pushing higher after the decision and the yen is in demand.\n\nBoth the USD/JPY and the EUR/JPY tested their 200-DMA to the downside, the GBP/JPY extends and consolidated losses below the 200 mark, and there is reason to believe - with what we heard from the BoJ thus far today - that the policy will become less loose to support the Japanese yen in the medium to long run.\n\nAcross the Pacific, the Federal Reserve (Fed) also started its two-day policy meeting and will announce its decision later today. The Fed is not expected to make a change to its rates today but is widely and wildly expected to hint at a September rate cut.\n\nActivity on Fed funds futures doesn't only hint at a 100% chance for a rate cut to happen in September but it also shows that the doves are getting ahead of themselves with the assessment of a nearly 15% chance that the Fed could cut 50bp or more in September - which will obviously not happen unless there is a big crisis or stress on the financial markets.\n\nTherefore, the stretched Fed pricing is a sign that the Fed cut expectations went too far and that we shall see a correction even though the Fed hints strongly at a September cut today - with the risk of hardly upsetting the market if it does not.\n\nThe US 2-year yield remains on track for further weakness in the base case scenario of a hint for a September cut, while the US 10-year yield consolidates near 4.13%, the US dollar is softer this morning, but the index remains in the bullish trend - above a major Fibonacci support to its YTD positive trend, as the rate cut bets elsewhere rise along with the Fed cut bets.\n\nIn this context, the EUR/USD tipped a toe below 1.08 yesterday after a surprise slowdown in German growth cast shadow on a better-than-expected EZ GDP number. Inflation figures on the other hand were encouraging in Spain but less so in Germany.\n\nThe aggregate EZ inflation figures are due later today. A sufficiently soft set of data should keep the European Central Bank (ECB) doves in charge of the market and not let the EUR/USD gain too much strength in case we see a dollar rebound after the Fed decision.\n\nNote that the US long-term bonds and the dollar also benefit from some safe-haven demand after an explosion in Beirut - following a Hezbollah attack on Israel during the weekend - escalated the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and directed capital toward safe-haven assets.\n\nIn this context, gold extends gains above the $2400 level, and the franc advances. The USD/CHF is no longer on track to extend the YTD gains, on the contrary, the pair slipped below a key Fibonacci support back in mid-July, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement that stands at 0.8885, and is now in the bearish consolidation zone.\n\nThe tense geopolitical setup and softening Fed expectations explain the U-turn in the USD/CHF. However, the global easing vibes will certainly encourage more interest rate cuts from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) this year and should limit the USD/CHF's downside potential.\n\nBeirut explosion, a swift flight to safety and a renewed selloff across the Big Tech stocks weighed on major US indices yesterday. The S&P 500 fell 0.50% while Nasdaq 100 slid around 1.40%. Nvidia tumbled 7% to its 100-DMA.\n\nBut, Nasdaq futures are in better shape this morning following a 7.5% rally from AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) after raising its forecast for AI accelerators. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), on the other hand, didn't blow anyone's mind when it reported earnings yesterday.\n\nThe overall revenue rose by a slightly better-than-expected 15%, but revenue from Azure, its cloud computing platform that's the main growth engine, grew only 29%, down from 31% in the previous period.\n\nAbout 8 percentage points of that increase was due to AI, up from 7 percentage points, but it was not enough. The market first sent Microsoft shares 9% down, the price than recovered to settle with around 3% loss.\n\nDue today after the bell, Meta's results will be important for those looking for hints that all that massive AI spending is bearing fruits. Meta (NASDAQ:META) had said last quarter that it needed to spend more on AI to get to a level of play that will generate revenue.\n\nHopefully, that timeline doesn't extend at this quarter's announcement. Zuckerberg knows that investors' patience is wearing thin as Meta trades some 15% below its July peak.\n\nUS crude tumbled to $75pb level yesterday, unable to recover from the negativeness of the sluggish Chinese growth. But the rising geopolitical tensions and a major decline of nearly 4.5-mio-barrels in the US oil inventories last week help to bring the dip buyers in near the $75pb level.\n\nI believe that we may have hit a bottom near the $75pb this week. And I also believe that the lower the prices will go the higher the chance of a delay from OPEC to exit its production cut strategy.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Come September, however, the CME FedWatch tool predicts a 4.1% chance of eased rates, as implied by 30-day futures prices. This probability is configured alongside a 12 to 13.8% chance of trimming basis points by 50 basis, instead of the usual 25.\n\nThis news comes with the recent dip in the consumer price index (CPI) in the US last June which brought the crypto market up after showing moderate inflation numbers at 3.3% year-on-year. Bets on Polymarket for the July 2024 decision show \"No Change\" at 96% odds.\n\nHowever, whether the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ultimately decides to hike or cut rates, a positive outcome for crypto is still predicted. A rate hike would mean a slower but steady improvement. A rate cut, on the other hand, would be bullish, given how lower interest rates typically reduce the cost of borrowing, encouraging more investment and liquidity in riskier assets like crypto. Additionally, lower rates have a tendency to weaken the fiat currencies, potentially driving investors to seek alternative stores of value such as crypto.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $65,600 level and continues its wobbling over the past month while equities remain resilient. But with the possibility of rate cuts come September, all directions point to a likely favorable outcome for crypto.\n\nThe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, and Bank of England are set to announce interest rate decisions this week, with analysts expecting divergent outcomes from each central bank.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) will lead off on Wednesday, with analysts split on whether it will raise rates from the current 0%-0.1% range or signal an imminent hike. Japan's inflation has remained above the bank's 2% target, while the yen hovers near multi-decade lows against the US dollar. The Wall Street Journal reported that the BOJ believes tighter monetary policy could boost sluggish consumption by strengthening the yen and easing import prices.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady at its Wednesday meeting, but markets anticipate a clear signal of a rate cut at the next meeting in September. CME FedWatch data shows 100% odds for a September rate cut, with a 12% chance of a 50 basis point reduction instead of the typical 25 basis points.\n\nOn Thursday, the Bank of England (BOE) faces a closely watched decision, with economists and markets split roughly 50/50 on whether it will cut rates for the first time in several years. Even if the BOE does ease, it's likely to indicate a cautious approach to future cuts.\n\nThese central bank decisions come amid a broader trend of monetary easing among major economies. The European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have already implemented rate cuts in recent months, signaling a shift from the multi-year tightening cycle.\n\nFor the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, the impact of these decisions may be limited in the short term, barring any significant surprises. However, the long-term trend towards easier monetary policy could potentially benefit risk assets like Bitcoin. This 56% year-to-date rally, while largely attributed to demand from US-based spot ETFs, may also reflect market anticipation of this easing cycle.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision comes days after a DOJ entity moved $2B worth of Bitcoin, present an intriguing juxtaposition in the financial and economic spheres. While the Fed is expected to hold rates steady and signal future cuts, potentially boosting risk assets like Bitcoin, the DOJ's large-scale transfer of seized crypto assets introduces an element of uncertainty into the market.\n\nThe timing of the DOJ's Bitcoin movement, just ahead of the Fed's announcement, raises questions about potential coordination or coincidence. If the Fed's decision aligns with market expectations of a dovish outlook, it could offset any negative pressure on Bitcoin's price caused by fears of government selling.\n\nConversely, if the Fed surprises with a more hawkish stance, it could compound any market jitters resulting from the DOJ's actions. This situation highlights how government actions across different domains - from monetary policy to law enforcement - may have interconnected effects on the crypto market.", "source": {"uri": "cryptobriefing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto Briefing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vince_dioquino@cryptobriefing.com", "name": "Vince Dioquino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Store of value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/31005939/BTC-charts-and-PCB-800x457.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

In the US, a $280 billion exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 was hit as Microsoft Corp. plunged amid slower cloud growth. That sets the scene for earnings from other tech heavyweights as markets also gear up for monetary policy decisions from the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.\n\nBank of Japan board members will discuss raising interest rates to around 0.25% on Wednesday from the current range of 0 to 0.1%, public broadcaster NHK reported, without identifying sources. The yen edged higher against the US dollar in early trading, extending Tuesday's gain.\n\nBonds and gold climbed Tuesday amid a renewed flare-up in geopolitical risks as Israel's military struck Beirut, aiming at a Hezbollah commander. Oil rose 0.7% early Wednesday.\n\nA rotation out of big tech has dragged the Nasdaq 100 down 9% from its all-time high -- leaving it on the cusp of a correction. The shift into cyclical pockets of the market began in earnest after signs of cooling inflation stoked bets the Fed will cut rates in September.\n\n\"If the Fed does not signal a September rate cut, markets could get a bit ugly given recent tech weakness -- especially if earnings underwhelm,\" said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell to around 5,435 on Tuesday. The Nasdaq 100 slid 1.4%. A gauge of the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps sank 2%. The Russell 2000 of small firms rose 0.3%. Nvidia Corp. tumbled 7%, wiping $193 billion from its market value.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc.'s chief David Solomon told CNBC that one or two Fed rate cuts later this year are looking increasingly likely. That's after predicting just two months ago there would be no reductions in 2024.\n\nIf the Fed is about to begin a rate cutting cycle, stock bulls have history on their side. In the six prior hiking cycles, the S&P 500 has risen an average 5% a year after the first cut, according to calculations by the financial research firm CFRA. What's more, the gains also broadened, with the small-cap Russell 2000 Index climbing 3.2% 12 months later, the data show.\n\nTo Bank of America Corp.'s Savita Subramanian, the S&P 500 has probably already logged the gains it will see this year, but the benchmark still presents ample opportunities for investors.\n\nWhile neutral on the index overall, she says there's potential for strong returns in a few areas: among dividend payers, \"old school\" capital-expenditure beneficiaries like infrastructure, construction and manufacturing stocks, and other themes that don't revolve around artificial intelligence.\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The precious metal's value climbed by 1.09%, or $26.40, with the most active December futures contract settling at $2,451.90 as of 5:50 PM EDT. This surge comes on the eve of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting's conclusion, highlighting the intricate dance between monetary policy expectations and commodity markets.\n\nThe anticipation of a dovish tone from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the FOMC's policy statement has been the primary driver behind gold's ascent. While a small portion of the gains can be attributed to a marginal weakening of the dollar, the majority stems from traders' bullish sentiment on gold, underscoring the metal's enduring appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty.\n\nAll eyes are now fixed on Wednesday's events, with the FOMC set to release its policy statement at 2:00 PM EDT, followed by Chairman Powell's press conference at 2:30 PM EDT. Although an immediate rate cut announcement is highly unlikely, market participants are keenly awaiting subtle shifts in language that could signal the Fed's inclination towards monetary easing in the near future.\n\nRyan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, suggests that Powell might \"plant a seed that a rate cut in September is on the table\" during his prepared remarks. This speculation is further fueled by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who anticipate a possible rewording of the Fed's stance on requiring \"greater confidence\" before implementing rate cuts. The potential shift to phrases like \"further progress\" or \"somewhat greater progress\" could acknowledge the positive trajectory of inflation towards the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nRecent economic data has bolstered the case for a more dovish Fed outlook. Last Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report revealed encouraging signs of cooling inflation. The headline inflation rate declined to 2.5% annually in June, down from May's 2.6%, while core PCE (excluding volatile food and energy costs) remained steady at 2.6%. These figures suggest that the Fed's restrictive monetary policy is yielding results, bringing inflation closer to the desired 2% target.\n\nMoreover, the consistency of recent economic reports over the past three months provides clear evidence of sustained inflation contraction. This trend reinforces the narrative that the Fed's aggressive rate hikes have been effective in tempering inflationary pressures without tipping the economy into recession - a delicate balance that has eluded policymakers in previous tightening cycles.\n\nWhile the immediate focus remains on the FOMC's communication, the broader implications for the gold market extend beyond short-term price movements. A dovish pivot by the Fed could set the stage for an extended rally in gold prices, as lower interest rates typically boost the appeal of non-yielding assets like precious metals.\n\nAs market participants parse every word of the upcoming policy statement and press conference, the gold market stands at a pivotal juncture. The interplay between monetary policy, economic data, and market sentiment will continue to shape the trajectory of gold prices.\n\nFor those who wish to learn more about our service, please go to the links below:", "source": {"uri": "kitco.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kitco.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precious metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://image-api.prod.kitco.com/image/ce498848-5070-4b93-9851-03f02e79abcc.png?top=0&left=24.014492753623&width=3265.9710144928&height=1833&scale_width=1920&token=d8021045a2ad6cf95afe7b5d900f862af83ed08be45130c113cd9e2235ed7b4c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776052", "eventUri": "eng-9776052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8251854744", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-31", "time": "06:16:55", "dateTime": "2024-07-31T06:16:55Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-31T06:16:09Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4627451002597809, "url": "https://www.actionforex.com/live-comments/561765-boj-hikes-microsoft-disappoints-fed-decides/", "title": "BoJ Hikes, Microsoft Disappoints, Fed Decides - Action Forex", "body": "The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised its rate to 0.25% as cautiously expected and announced that it will reduce the monthly bond purchases in a predictable manner - but allow enough flexibility to support stability in the JGB markets. More importantly, the language in the communique was quite bullish on prices. The BoJ officials said that 'underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify.' The latter hinted that today's rate hike is certainly not the BoJ's last one. Now, all eyes are on BoJ Governor Ueda for further tips and hints. The 10-year JGP yield is pushing higher after the decision and the yen is in demand. Both the USDJPY and the EURJPY tested their 200-DMA to the downside, the GBPJPY extends and consolidates losses below the 200 mark, and there is reason to believe - with what we heard from the BoJ thus far today - that the policy will become less loose to support the Japanese yen in the medium to long run.\n\nAcross the Pacific, the Federal Reserve (Fed) also started its two-day policy meeting and will announce its decision later today. The Fed is not expected to make a change to its rates today, but is widely and wildly expected to hint at a September rate cut. Activity on Fed funds futures doesn't only hint at a 100% chance for a rate cut to happen in September but it also shows that the doves are getting ahead of themselves with the assessment of a nearly 15% chance that the Fed could cut 50bp or more in September - which will obviously not happen unless there is a big crisis or stress on the financial markets. Therefore, the stretched Fed pricing is a sign that the Fed cut expectations went too far and that we shall see a correction even though the Fed hints strongly at a September cut today - with the risk of hardly upsetting the market if it does not.\n\nThe US 2-year yield remains on track for further weakness in the base case scenario of a hint for September cut, while the US 10-year yield consolidates near 4.13%, the US dollar is softer this morning, but the index remains in the bullish trend - above a major Fibonacci support to its ytd positive trend, as the rate cut bets elsewhere rise along with the Fed cut bets. In this context, the EURUSD tipped a toe below the 1.08 yesterday after a surprise slowdown in German growth casted shadow on a better-than-expected EZ GDP number. Inflation figures on the other hand were encouraging in Spain but less so in Germany. The aggregate EZ inflation figures are due later today. A sufficiently soft set of data should keep the European Central Bank (ECB) doves in charge of the market and not let the EURUSD gain too much strength in case we see a dollar rebound after the Fed decision.\n\nTensions and Franc\n\nNote that the US long-term bonds and the dollar also benefit from some safe haven demand after an explosion in Beirut - following a Hezbollah attack on Israel during the weekend - escalate the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and directs capital toward safe haven assets. In this context, gold extends gains above the $2400 level and the franc advances. The USDCHF is no longer on track to extend the ytd gains, on the contrary, the pair slipped below a key Fibonacci support back in mid-July, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement that stands 0.8885, and is now in the bearish consolidation zone. The tense geopolitical setup and softening Fed expectations explain the U-turn in the USDCHF. However, the global easing vibes will certainly encourage more interest rate cuts from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) this year, and should limit the USDCHF's downside potential.\n\nInside tech\n\nBeirut explosion, a swift flight to safety and a renewed selloff across the Big Tech stocks weighed on major US indices yesterday. The S&P500 fell 0.50% while Nasdaq 100 slid around 1.40%. Nvidia tumbled 7% to its 100-DMA. But, Nasdaq futures are in a better shape this morning following a 7.5% rally from AMD after raising its forecast for AI accelerators. Microsoft, on the other hand, didn't blow anyone's mind when it reported earnings yesterday. The overall revenue rose by a slightly better-than-expected 15%, but revenue from Azure, its cloud computing platform that's the main growth engine, grew only 29%, down from 31% in the previous period. About 8 percentage points of that increase was due to AI, up from 7 percentage points, but it was not enough. The market first sent Microsoft shares 9% down, the price than recovered to settle with around 3% loss. Due today after the bell, Meta's results will be important for those looking for hints that all that massive AI spending is bearing fruits. Meta had said last quarter that it needed to spend more on AI to get to a level of play that will generate revenue. Hopefully, that timeline doesn't extend at this quarter's announcement. Zuckerberg knows that investors' patience is wearing thin as Meta trades some 15% below its July peak.\n\nBottom?\n\nUS crude tumbled to $75pb level yesterday, unable to recover from the negativeness of the sluggish Chinese growth. But the rising geopolitical tensions and a major decline of nearly 4.5-mio-barrels in the US oil inventories last week help to bring the dip buyers in near the $75pb level. I believe that we may have hit a bottom near the $75pb this week. And I also believe that the lower the prices will go the higher the chance of a delay from OPEC to exit its production cut strategy.\n\nNote that I will be on holiday for the next two weeks.

It also affects inflation in a broad-based and sustained way, beyond the direct impact on import prices.\"\n\nIn Q1 2024, private consumption fell by 0.7%, contributing to a 0.5% contraction in the Japanese economy.\n\nIt is a crucial day for the US dollar, with the FOMC interest rate decision and press conference in focus.\n\nEconomists predict the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged, putting the FOMC press conference under the spotlight.\n\nFed Chair Powell's stance on inflation, the labor market, and the timing of Fed rate cuts will be critical. Concerns about the labor market and a declaration of victory in the inflation battle could signal September and December rate cuts.\n\nA more dovish Fed rate path would support a USD/JPY drop below 150, while concerns about inflation could push the USD/JPY above 155.\n\nIn July, Fed Chair Powell said Q2 inflation numbers raised confidence that inflation was returning to the 2% target.\n\nWall Street Journal Chief Economics Correspondent Nick Timiraos commented on the looming Fed interest rate decision,\n\n\" The big question is where the committee and chair sets the bar for a September cut. The cleanest signal probably comes from Powell's press conference because it's much easier to convey nuance there, but...\"\n\nUSD/JPY trends will hinge on the Bank of Japan and the Fed's monetary policy decisions and forward guidance. Aggressive BoJ cuts to JGB purchases and support for multiple rate hikes would bring sub-150 into play.

already logged the gains it will see this year, but the benchmark still presents ample opportunities for investors.\n\nWhile neutral on the index overall, she says there's potential for strong returns

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $66,300, down from this week's high of $70,000 while Ethereum was at $3,320.\n\nThe market cap of all cryptocurrencies was down by just 0.78% to $2.38 trillion. Even some of the best-performing altcoins of the day like Mog Coin (MOG), Kaspa (KAS), and Ripple (XRP) were up by less than 6%.\n\nEconomists expect the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged between 5.50% and 5.25% in this meeting. According to Polymarket, only 4% of participants in the $2.4 million pool expect the bank to slash rates by 25 basis points.\n\nNonetheless, this will be an important meeting since the bank could provide guidance on when rate cuts will start.\n\nWith inflation falling for three consecutive months and the unemployment rate rising, the Fed could point to a September cut. The alternative scenario is where the bank maintains a vague data-dependence posture. In this case, it will watch Friday's non-farm payrolls data for cues on the labor market and the next consumer price index report. It will then provide guidance on a September cut at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nAll assets are impacted by the actions of the FOMC. For example, in 2020 and 2021, BTC and other altcoins soared as the bank slashed rates to zero. They then reversed in 2022 as the bank started its benchmark rates.\n\nOne reason Bitcoin and other coins could do well when the Fed starts cutting interest rates is that investors have packed trillions in low-risk assets. Money market funds have accumulated over $6.1 trillion in assets as investors benefit from the average return of 5%.\n\nThese assets will be less attractive when interest rates start moving downwards. As a result, there are chances of a rotation to riskier assets like stocks, crypto, and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nStill, for this meeting, the impact on cryptocurrencies may be limited since the rate pause has been priced in.

The longer the Fed waits to lower the policy rate, though, the more anxious they will become over possible cracks \"because recessions are nonlinear and hard to stop once they start,\" he said.\n\nThe cracks are hard to see so far, particularly on the real-economy side, with unemployment, at 4.1%, higher than it has been since the Fed's rate hikes began but still low by historical standards, and inflation coming down slowly toward the Fed's 2% goal.\n\nThe U.S. household debt delinquency rate rose to 3.2% during the first quarter versus 3.1% in the final three months of last year, New York Fed data shows. That's below the 4.7% seen at the end of 2019 before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStill, credit-card borrowers who have reached their borrowing limits - this group tends to be disproportionately younger and lower-income - have seen a particularly sharp rise in delinquency rates, New York Fed researchers found.\n\n\"It does seem as though lower-income households are more strained in their personal finances and that will have a ripple effect,\" Tang said. \"September would not be too late to start easing the policy rate; actual interest rates will start to fall beforehand and this way the Fed can be a bit more sure about inflation before it begins.\"\n\n(Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Dan Burns and Paul Simao)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Here's what top experts say | Stock Market News", "body": "The Federal Reserve has maintained a firm stance on achieving its 2 per cent inflation target. While inflation remains a key focus, the Fed now considers risks to employment to be equally significant.\n\nThe start of the interest rate reduction cycle in the US may not be far, thanks to easing inflation. Addressing the press after the monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, July 31, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the first interest rate cut could occur as early as September. However, he added a caveat, stating that this would depend on data showing inflation moving sustainably towards the 2 per cent target.\n\nFor the past year, benchmark interest rates in the US have remained in the 5.25-5.50 per cent range. The Federal Reserve has maintained a firm stance on achieving its 2 per cent inflation target. While inflation remains a key focus, the Fed now considers risks to employment to be equally significant.\n\n\"If we were to see inflation moving down ... more or less in line with expectations, growth remains reasonably strong, and the labour market remains consistent with current conditions, then I think a rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting,\" Reuters quoted Powell saying so.\n\nUS Fed rate cuts could inject fresh momentum into the market, which is already at record highs but is struggling to maintain gains due to valuation concerns and the absence of new catalysts.\n\nMint consulted several experts to gain insights into how Fed rate cuts might impact various asset classes and to determine the strategies investors should adopt. Here's what they said:\n\nUS bond prices have risen, and the 10-year yield has fallen to 4.05 per cent, which is positive for capital flows to emerging markets like India.\n\nThe decline in the dollar index is positive for gold. Indian market is now outperforming other markets in terms of rise in market cap, which is mainly driven by the rise in the broader market.\n\nThe market's concern is about valuations.\n\nThe Nifty 50 is trading around 22 times FY25 earnings, which is not excessive given India's long-term growth prospects.\n\nHowever, the valuations in the broader market, driven by liquidity, are hard to justify.\n\nA rate cut by the Federal Reserve boosts the equity and gold markets because lower interest rates result in cheaper business borrowing, facilitating easier expansion and reduced carrying costs.\n\nThis leads to increased profitability. Consequently, stock and commodities prices rise as investors perceive higher potential returns due to improved business prospects.\n\nHowever, interest rates and bond prices are correlated; bond prices decline when interest rates are cut.\n\nThe anticipated rate cut in September has already been factored into today's market prices.\n\nTherefore, investors and traders should now focus on the significantly escalating international geopolitical tensions.\n\nWe recommend that investors begin to book profits or implement strict stop-loss measures, as the upcoming weeks are expected to be highly volatile for global equity and commodities markets.\n\nThat signal is tempered by a notably less dovish policy statement containing only subtle hints of an impending rate cut.\n\nIt impacted the markets in a positive way, both for equities and gold.\n\nWe believe the financial markets have already discounted the prospective rate cut in September.\n\nHence, investors should take advantage of this policy by booking profits in equities.\n\nThey should buy long-term government bond funds as interest rates will fall significantly over the next 15 months.\n\nThey should also invest in gold on every dip.\n\nWe expect equities to outperform as some allocation (both existing and incremental) in debt instruments moves towards high-yield assets.\n\nWe anticipate bond yields will ease further as the case for multiple rate cuts becomes stronger in the future.\n\nWe advise investors to gradually increase their allocation towards equities with a medium -- to long-term perspective.\n\nRead all

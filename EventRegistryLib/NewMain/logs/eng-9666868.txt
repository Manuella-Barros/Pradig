Air defenses intercepted all the drones and five cruise missiles, it said.\n\nThe attack hit power structures in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv and Vinnytsia regions of Ukraine, causing \"extensive damage,\" according to national power company Ukrenergo. Seven workers were injured, it said.\n\nUkrenergo announced extended blackouts across the country despite electricity imports and help with emergency supplies from European countries.\n\nPrivate energy company DTEK said one of its power plants was hit in the overnight attack but did not specify its location. Three company employees were injured and the plant's equipment was severely damaged, DTEK said on social media.\n\nAmong the most damaging recent strikes on Ukraine's energy supply were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.\n\nRolling blackouts have affected Ukrainian households and industry.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the strikes aimed at Ukrainian energy facilities that are needed to produce weapons and military equipment. Ukraine, which is heavily dependent on Western military aid, is developing a small but fast-growing defense industry.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, authorities in two regions reported fires at oil storage depots after drone attacks, two days after a Ukrainian strike started a huge blaze at another refinery.\n\nUkraine has in recent months stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals in an effort to disrupt the Kremlin's war machine.\n\nThe overnight drone attacks were carried out by Ukraine's Security Service, known by its acronym SBU, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press.\n\nThe attacks triggered fires at the facilities, which processed and stored crude oil and its derivatives used to supply the Russian army, the official said.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.\n\nThe head of Russia's Adygea region, Murat Kumpilov, said a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in the town of Enem that was later extinguished.\n\nThe governor of the Tambov region, Maxim Yegorov, said an oil reservoir went ablaze at an oil depot there.\n\nKrasnodar region Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said a drone hit a private house in the town of Slavyansk, killing a woman.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said air defenses downed 15 Ukrainian drones over three regions but didn't mention any damage. The ministry said it has shot down more than 26,000 Ukrainian drones since the start of the war.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on the latest barrage but Moscow insists that its forces do not target civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry has, however, acknowledged retaliatory attacks on energy sites in response to a wave of Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian oil facilities, mainly storage sites.\n\nIn the latest Ukrainian attack on Russian territory, the governor of Russia's Krasnodar region, near the annexed Crimean peninsula, announced one woman had been killed in a drone attack targeting oil facilities.\n\nAmong the areas struck was the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban in Krasnodar region, where the woman was killed, governor Venyamin Kondratyev said.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said it had downed 15 Ukrainian drones that also targeted oil storage depots in the southern Adygea republic and in the Tambov region.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Ukraine but sources in its security services have claimed responsibility for previous, similar attacks, with the stated aim of hurting Russian oil revenues and emptying its war chest.\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia had launched nine missiles and 27 Iranian-designed attack drones, and that air defense systems had downed all the projectiles except four missiles.\n\nIt also confirmed that \"critical infrastructure\" facilities were targeted, including in the Dnipropetrovsk region, one of the regions in which DTEK operates.\n\nIt said air defense systems were also activated in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv and Kyiv, among others.\n\nThe energy ministry said a total of seven employees at energy facilities had been wounded and that more than 200,000 people had been temporarily cut off in the Vinnytsia region.\n\n\"There will be no outages for critical infrastructure companies,\" it added.\n\nRussia has meanwhile stepped up fatal artillery attacks on embattled frontline regions of Ukraine, in the south and the east of the country.\n\nThe governor of the southern Kherson region announced on Thursday morning that one person had been killed and three wounded over the last 24 hours.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a northeastern region where Russia recently launched a surprise ground offensive, the governor said one woman had been killed by Russian fire.\n\nAnd in the eastern Donetsk region, the governor said two people had been killed, including one in the frontline town of Toretsk where Russian forces have gained ground after a long lull in fighting there.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said on Thursday Russian forces were trying to dislodge its troops from the nearby villages of Shumy and New York.", "source": {"uri":

Air defences intercepted all the drones and five cruise missiles, it said.\n\nThe attack hit power structures in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv and Vinnytsia regions of Ukraine, causing \"extensive damage,\" according to national power company Ukrenergo. Seven workers were injured, it said.\n\nUkrenergo announced extended blackouts across the country despite electricity imports and help with emergency supplies from European countries.\n\nPrivate energy company DTEK said one of its power plants was hit in the overnight attack but did not specify its location. Three company employees were injured and the plant's equipment was severely damaged, DTEK said on social media.\n\nAmong the most damaging recent strikes on Ukraine's energy supply were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.\n\nRolling blackouts have affected Ukrainian households and industry.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, authorities in two regions reported fires at oil storage depots after drone attacks, two days after a Ukrainian strike started a huge blaze at another refinery.\n\nUkraine has in recent months stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals in an effort to disrupt the Kremlin's war machine.\n\nMurat Kumpilov, head of Russia's Adygea region, said a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in the town of Enem that was later extinguished.\n\nThe head of the Tambov region, Maxim Yegorov, said an oil reservoir went ablaze at an oil depot there.\n\nKrasnodar region Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said a drone hit a private house in the town of Slavyansk, killing a woman.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said air defences downed 15 Ukrainian drones over three regions but didn't

The attack affected electricity for over 218,000 consumers and wounded seven workers. Ukraine's air force shot down most of the missiles and drones, but rolling blackouts are expected to increase.\n\nRussia launched a new barrage of missiles and drones at Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday, causing \"significant\" damage to a thermal power plant and maintaining pressure on the electricity grid, Ukrainian officials said. The attack on energy infrastructure in four regions damaged equipment, wounded seven workers and cut off electricity to more than 218,000 consumers, the energy ministry said.\n\nThe attacks have knocked out half Ukraine's energy generating capacity since March and forced rolling blackouts, Kyiv says. Moscow says energy facilities are a legitimate military target and that some of the strikes were retaliation for Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory. Officials in Kyiv have for months been appealing to Ukraine's allies to supply more air defences against the air strikes carried out by Russia throughout the nearly 28-month-old full-scale invasion.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said it shot down five out of nine missiles and all 27 drones launched by Russia over 10 Ukrainian regions during Thursday's attack. Despite the military's readout, private power company DTEK said one of its thermal power plants suffered significant damage from the drone attack. The strikes, it said, amounted to the seventh large-scale attack on its infrastructure since March 22.\n\nNational grid operator Ukrenergo said the attack would lead to an increase in the quantity of scheduled blackouts on Thursday. The military said the attack mostly targeted eastern Ukraine and in particular the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nThe region's governor said five drones and four missiles were shot down over the region. Three men were wounded in the attack, which also damaged seven homes, he said. Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said air defences shot down all incoming aerial targets on their approach to the capital, and no damage or injuries were reported in the city.\n\nAir defences also downed four drones over the central region of Vinnytsia, where debris damaged a critical infrastructure object, the regional governor said without identifying it.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thermal power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drone warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_blackout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rolling blackout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblasts_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oblasts of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrenergo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrenergo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serhiy_Popko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serhiy Popko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTEK", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DTEK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnipropetrovsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dnipropetrovsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dnipropetrovsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinnytsia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vinnytsia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vinnytsia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/30_05_2024_23_33_34_4148777.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666868", "eventUri": "eng-9666868", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-22", "textStart": 1605, "textEnd": 1613}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Air defences intercepted all the drones and five cruise missiles, it said.\n\nThe attack hit power structures in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv and Vinnytsia regions of Ukraine, causing \"extensive damage\", according to national power company Ukrenergo.

Three company employees were injured and the plant's equipment was severely damaged, DTEK said on social media.\n\nAmong the most damaging recent strikes on Ukraine's energy supply were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.\n\nRolling blackouts have affected Ukrainian households and industry.\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement that the strikes aimed at Ukrainian energy facilities that are needed to produce weapons and military equipment. Ukraine, which is heavily dependent on Western military aid, is developing a small but fast-growing defence industry.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, authorities in two regions reported fires at oil storage depots after drone attacks, two days after a Ukrainian strike started a huge blaze at another refinery.\n\nUkraine has in recent months stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals in an effort to disrupt the Kremlin's war machine.\n\nThe overnight drone attacks were carried out by Ukraine's Security Service, known by its acronym SBU, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press.\n\nThe attacks triggered fires at the facilities, which processed and stored crude oil and its derivatives used to supply the Russian army, the official said.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.\n\nThe head of Russia's Adygea region, Murat Kumpilov, said a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in the town of Enem that was later extinguished.\n\nThe governor of the Tambov region, Maxim Yegorov, said an oil reservoir went ablaze at an oil depot there.\n\nKrasnodar region Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said a drone hit a private house in the town of Slavyansk, killing a woman.\n\nRussia's Defence Ministry said air defences downed 15 Ukrainian drones over three regions but didn't mention any damage.

Moscow has said energy facilities are a legitimate military target and that some of the strikes were retaliation for Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv have for months been appealing to Ukraine's allies to supply more air defences against the air strikes carried out by Russia throughout the nearly 28-month-old full-scale invasion.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said it shot down five out of nine missiles and all 27 drones launched by Russia over 10 Ukrainian regions during today's attack.\n\nPrivate power company DTEK said one of its thermal power plants suffered significant damage during what it said was the seventh large-scale attack on its infrastructure since March 22.\n\n\"Enemy missiles hit a DTEK power station already damaged in previous attacks... We urgently need to close our skies or Ukraine faces a serious crisis this winter. My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" said the company's CEO, Maxim Timchenko.\n\nNational grid operator Ukrenergo said the attack would lead to an increase in scheduled blackouts today.\n\nThe military said the attack mostly targeted eastern Ukraine and in particular the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nDnipropetrovsk's governor said five drones and four missiles were shot down over the region. Three men were wounded in the attack, which also damaged seven homes, he said.\n\nSerhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said air defences shot down all incoming aerial targets on their approach to the capital, and no damage or injuries were reported in the city.\n\nAir defences also downed four drones over the central region of Vinnytsia, where debris damaged a critical

target civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry, however, confirmed it had carried out \"precision\" strikes on energy facilities that support military production, as a response to Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil facilities.\n\nIn the latest Ukrainian attack on Russian territory, the governor of the Krasnodar region -- near Ukraine's Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula -- announced that one woman had been killed in a drone attack targeting oil facilities.\n\nALSO READ: Ukraine's Azov hails US lifting weapons ban\n\nAmong the areas struck was the city of

storage depots in the southern Adygea republic and in the Tambov region.\n\nA source in the Ukrainian security services told AFP drones deployed by the Security Services of Ukraine (SBU) were behind attacks in the two Russian regions.\n\n\"These facilities processed and stored raw materials and finished products, which were later used by the Russian army,\" the source said, vowing more attacks on Russian oil facilities, with the aim of denting the Kremlin's war chest.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said that Russia had launched nine missiles and 27 Iranian-designed attack drones, and that air defence systems had downed all the projectiles except four missiles.\n\nIt said air defence systems were also activated in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv and Kyiv, among others.\n\nThe energy ministry said a total of seven employees at energy facilities had been wounded and that more than 200,000 people had been temporarily cut off in the Vinnytsia region.\n\n\"There will be no outages for critical infrastructure companies,\" it added.\n\nRussia has meanwhile stepped up fatal artillery attacks on embattled frontline regions in the south and east of Ukraine.\n\nALSO READ: Russia says captured two villages in eastern Ukraine\n\nThe governor of the southern Kherson region announced on Thursday morning that two people had been killed and three wounded in recent Russian attacks.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a northeastern region where Russia recently launched a surprise ground offensive, the governor said one woman had been killed by Russian fire.\n\nAnd in the Donetsk region, the governor said two people had been killed earlier, including one in the frontline town of Toretsk, where Russian forces have gained ground after a long lull in fighting

My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on the latest barrage but Moscow insists that its forces do not target civilian infrastructures.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has, however, acknowledged retaliatory attacks on energy sites in response to a wave of Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian oil facilities, mainly storage sites.\n\nIn the latest Ukrainian attack on Russian territory, the governor of Russia's Krasnodar region, which borders the annexed Crimean peninsula, announced one woman had been killed in a drone attack targeting oil facilities.\n\nAmong the areas struck was the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban in Krasnodar region, where the woman was killed, governor Venyamin Kondratyev said.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said it had downed 15 Ukrainian drones that also targeted oil storage depots in the southern Adygea republic and in the Tambov region.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Ukraine but sources in its security services have claimed responsibility for previous similar attacks, with the aim of hurting Russian oil revenues.\n\n'Critical infrastructure'\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia had launched nine missiles and 27 Iranian-designed attack drones, and that air defence systems had downed all the projectiles except four missiles.\n\nIt also confirmed that \"critical infrastructure\" facilities were targeted, including in the Dnipropetrovsk region, one of the regions in which DTEK operates.\n\nIt said air defence systems were also activated in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv and Kyiv, among others.\n\nRussia has meanwhile stepped up fatal artillery attacks on embattled frontline regions of Ukraine, in the south and the east of the country.\n\nThe governor of the southern Kherson region announced on Thursday morning that one person had been killed and three wounded over the last 24 hours.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a northeastern region where Russia recently launched a surprise ground offensive, the governor said one woman had been killed by Russian fire.\n\nAnd in the eastern Donetsk region, the governor said two people had been killed, one in the frontline town of Toretsk where Russian forces have gained ground after attacking following a long lull in fighting there.", "source":

Air defenses intercepted all the drones and five cruise missiles, it said.\n\nThe attack hit power structures in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv and Vinnytsia regions of Ukraine, causing \"extensive damage,\" according to national power company Ukrenergo. Seven workers were injured, it said.\n\nUkrenergo announced extended blackouts across the country despite electricity imports and help with emergency supplies from European countries.\n\nPrivate energy company DTEK said one of its power plants was hit in the overnight attack but did not specify its location. Three company employees were injured and the plant's equipment was severely damaged, DTEK said on social media.\n\nAmong the most damaging recent strikes on Ukraine's energy supply were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.\n\nRolling blackouts have affected Ukrainian households and industry.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, authorities in two regions reported fires at oil storage depots after drone attacks, two days after a Ukrainian strike started a huge blaze at another refinery.\n\nUkraine has in recent months stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals in an effort to disrupt the Kremlin's war machine.\n\nMurat Kumpilov, head of Russia's Adygea region, said a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in the town of Enem that was later extinguished.\n\nThe head of the Tambov region, Maxim Yegorov, said an oil reservoir went ablaze at an oil depot there.\n\nKrasnodar region Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said a drone hit a private house in the town of Slavyansk, killing a woman.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said air defenses downed 15 Ukrainian drones over three regions but didn't mention any damage.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"},

My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on the latest barrage but Moscow says its forces do not target civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has, however, acknowledged retaliatory attacks on energy sites in response to a wave of Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian oil facilities, mainly storage sites.\n\nIn the latest Ukrainian attack on Russian territory, the governor of the Krasnodar region -- near Ukraine's Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula -- announced one woman had been killed in a drone attack targeting oil facilities.\n\nAmong the areas struck was the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban in Krasnodar region, where the woman was killed, governor Venyamin Kondratyev said.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said it had downed 15 Ukrainian drones that also targeted oil storage depots in the southern Adygea republic and in the Tambov region.\n\nA source in the Ukrainian security services told AFP drones deployed by the Security Services of Ukraine (SBU) were behind attacks in the two Russian regions.\n\n\"These facilities processed and stored raw materials and finished products, which were later used by the Russian army,\" the source said, vowing more attacks on Russian oil facilities, with the aim of denting the Kremlin's war chest.\n\n'CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE'\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said that Russia had launched nine missiles and 27 Iranian-designed attack drones, and that air defence systems had downed all the projectiles except four missiles.\n\nIt said air defence systems were also activated in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv and Kyiv, among others.\n\nThe energy ministry said a total of seven employees at energy facilities had been wounded and that more than 200,000 people had been temporarily cut off in the Vinnytsia region.\n\n\"There will be no outages for critical infrastructure companies,\" it added.\n\nRussia has meanwhile stepped up fatal artillery attacks on embattled frontline regions in the south and east of Ukraine.\n\nThe governor of the southern Kherson region announced on Thursday morning that two people had been killed and three wounded in recent Russian attacks.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a northeastern region where Russia recently launched a surprise ground offensive, the governor said one woman had been killed by Russian fire.\n\nAnd in the eastern Donetsk region, the governor said two people had been killed, including one in the frontline town of Toretsk, where Russian forces have gained ground after a long lull in fighting there.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said Russian forces were trying to dislodge its troops from the nearby villages of Shumy and New York.", "source": {"uri": "ewn.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "EWN Traffic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@ewn.co.za", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type":

Moscow says energy facilities are a legitimate military target and that some of the strikes were retaliation for Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv have for months been appealing to Ukraine's allies to supply more air defenses against the air strikes carried out by Russia throughout the nearly 28-month-old full-scale invasion.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said it shot down five out of nine missiles and all 27 drones launched by Russia over 10 Ukrainian regions during Thursday's attack.\n\nDespite the military's readout, private power company DTEK said one of its thermal power plants suffered significant damage from the drone attack. The strikes, it said, amounted to the seventh large-scale attack on its infrastructure since March 22.\n\nNational grid operator Ukrenergo said the attack would lead to an increase in the quantity of scheduled blackouts on Thursday.\n\nThe military said the attack mostly targeted eastern Ukraine and in particular the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nThe region's governor said five drones and four missiles were shot down over the region. Three men were wounded in the attack, which also damaged seven homes, he said.\n\nSerhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said air defenses shot down all incoming aerial targets on their approach to the capital, and no damage or injuries were reported in the city.\n\nAir defenses also downed four drones over the central region of Vinnytsia, where debris damaged a critical infrastructure object, the regional governor said without identifying it.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblasts_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oblasts of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_blackout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling blackout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrenergo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrenergo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drone warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serhiy_Popko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serhiy Popko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTEK", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DTEK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnipropetrovsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dnipropetrovsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dnipropetrovsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinnytsia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vinnytsia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vinnytsia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2024/06/20/4425886-187832459.jpg?itok=DGEbUzyN", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666868", "eventUri": "eng-9666868", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-22", "textStart": 1413, "textEnd": 1421}], "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on the latest barrage but Moscow insists that its forces do not target civilian infrastructures.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has, however, acknowledged retaliatory attacks on energy sites in response to a wave of Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian oil facilities, mainly storage sites.\n\nIn the latest Ukrainian attack on Russian territory, the governor of Russia's Krasnodar region, which borders the annexed Crimean peninsula, announced one woman had been killed in a drone attack targeting oil facilities.\n\nAmong the areas struck was the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban in Krasnodar region, where the woman was killed, governor Venyamin Kondratyev said.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said it had downed 15 Ukrainian drones that also targeted oil storage depots in the southern Adygea republic and in the Tambov region.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Ukraine but sources in its security services have claimed responsibility for previous similar attacks, with the aim of hurting Russian oil revenues.\n\n- 'Critical infrastructure' -\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia had launched nine missiles and 27 Iranian-designed attack drones, and that air defence systems had downed all the projectiles except four missiles.\n\nIt also confirmed that \"critical infrastructure\" facilities were targeted, including in the Dnipropetrovsk region, one of the regions in which DTEK operates.\n\nIt said air defence systems were also activated in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv and Kyiv, among others.\n\nRussia has meanwhile stepped up fatal artillery attacks on embattled frontline regions of Ukraine, in the south and the east of the country.\n\nThe governor of the southern Kherson region announced on Thursday morning that one person had been killed and three wounded over the last 24 hours.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a northeastern region where Russia recently launched a surprise ground offensive, the governor said one woman had been killed by Russian fire.\n\nAnd in the eastern Donetsk region, the governor said two people had been killed, one in the frontline town of Toretsk where Russian forces have gained ground after attacking following a long lull in fighting there.", "source": {"uri":

My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on the latest barrage but Moscow insists that its forces do not target civilian infrastructures.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has, however, acknowledged retaliatory attacks on energy sites in response to a wave of Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian oil facilities, mainly storage sites.\n\nIn the latest Ukrainian attack on Russian territory, the governor of Russia's Krasnodar region, which borders the annexed Crimean peninsula, announced one woman had been killed in a drone attack targeting oil facilities.\n\nMore from this section Inaugural Black Legacy Awards and Juneteenth Awards Dinner held in Hempstead Boeing's Safety Concerns: Passenger Trust Dwindles France tries suspects over false Brigitte Macron transgender claim\n\nAmong the areas struck was the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban in Krasnodar region, where the woman was killed, governor Venyamin Kondratyev said.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said it had downed 15 Ukrainian drones that also targeted oil storage depots in the southern Adygea republic and in the Tambov region.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Ukraine but sources in its security services have claimed responsibility for previous similar attacks, with the aim of hurting Russian oil revenues.\n\n- 'Critical infrastructure' -\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia had launched nine missiles and 27 Iranian-designed attack drones, and that air defence systems had downed all the projectiles except four missiles.\n\nIt also confirmed that \"critical infrastructure\" facilities were targeted, including in the Dnipropetrovsk region, one of the regions in which DTEK operates.\n\nIt said air defence systems were also activated in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv and Kyiv, among others.\n\nRussia has meanwhile stepped up fatal artillery attacks on embattled frontline regions of Ukraine, in the south and the east of the country.\n\nThe governor of the southern Kherson region announced on Thursday morning that one person had been killed and three wounded over the last 24 hours.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a northeastern region where Russia recently launched a surprise ground offensive, the governor said one woman had been killed by Russian fire.\n\nAnd in the eastern Donetsk region, the governor said two people had been killed, one in the frontline town of Toretsk where Russian forces have gained ground after attacking following a long lull in fighting there.\n\nbur-jbr/brw/gil", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daria_andriievska@reformer.com", "name":

Three company employees were injured and the plant's equipment was severely damaged, DTEK said on social media.\n\nAmong the most damaging recent strikes on Ukraine's energy supply were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.\n\nRolling blackouts have affected Ukrainian households and industry.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, authorities in two regions reported fires at oil storage depots after drone attacks, two days after a Ukrainian strike started a huge blaze at another refinery.\n\nUkraine has in recent months stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals in an effort to disrupt the Kremlin's war machine.\n\nMurat Kumpilov, head of Russia's Adygea region, said a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in the town of Enem that was later extinguished.\n\nThe head of the Tambov region, Maxim Yegorov, said an oil reservoir went ablaze at an oil depot there.\n\nKrasnodar region governor Veniamin Kondratyev said a drone hit a private house in the town of Slavyansk, killing a woman.\n\nRussia's

Air defenses intercepted all the drones and five cruise missiles, it said.\n\nThe attack hit power structures in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv and Vinnytsia regions of Ukraine, according to national power company Ukrenergo.\n\nPrivate energy company DTEK said one of its power plants was hit in the overnight attack but did not specify its location. Three company employees were injured and the plant's equipment was severely damaged, DTEK said on social media.\n\nAmong the most damaging recent strikes on Ukraine's energy supply were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.\n\nRolling blackouts have affected Ukrainian households and industry.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, authorities in two regions reported fires at oil storage depots after drone attacks, two days after a Ukrainian strike started a huge blaze at another refinery.\n\nUkraine has in recent months stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals in an effort to disrupt the Kremlin's war machine.\n\nMurat Kumpilov, head of Russia's Adygea region, said a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in the town of Enem that was later extinguished.\n\nThe head of the Tambov region, Maxim Yegorov, said an oil reservoir went ablaze at an oil depot there.\n\nKrasnodar region Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said a drone hit a private house in the town of Slavyansk, killing a woman.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said air defenses downed 15 Ukrainian drones over three regions but didn't mention any damage.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on the latest barrage but Moscow insists that its forces do not target civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry has, however, acknowledged retaliatory attacks on energy sites in response to a wave of Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian oil facilities, mainly storage sites.\n\nIn the latest Ukrainian attack on Russian territory, the governor of Russia's Krasnodar region, near the annexed Crimean peninsula, announced one woman had been killed in a drone attack targeting oil facilities.\n\nAmong the areas struck was the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban in Krasnodar region, where the woman was killed, governor Venyamin Kondratyev said.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said it had downed 15 Ukrainian drones that also targeted oil storage depots in the southern Adygea republic and in the Tambov region.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Ukraine but sources in its security services have claimed responsibility for previous, similar attacks, with the stated aim of hurting Russian oil revenues and emptying its war chest.\n\n'Critical infrastructure'\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia had launched nine missiles and 27 Iranian-designed attack drones, and that air defense systems had downed all the projectiles except four missiles.\n\nIt also confirmed that \"critical infrastructure\" facilities were targeted, including in the Dnipropetrovsk region, one of the regions in which DTEK operates.\n\nIt said air defense systems were also activated in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv and Kiev, among others.\n\nThe energy ministry said a total of seven employees at energy facilities had been wounded and that more than 200,000 people had been temporarily cut off in the Vinnytsia region.\n\n\"There will be no outages for critical infrastructure companies,\" it added.\n\nRussia has meanwhile stepped up fatal artillery attacks on embattled frontline regions of Ukraine, in the south and the east of the country.\n\nThe governor of the southern Kherson region announced on Thursday morning that one person had been killed and three wounded over the last 24 hours.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a northeastern region where Russia recently launched a surprise ground offensive, the governor said one woman had been killed by Russian fire.\n\nAnd in the eastern Donetsk region, the governor said two people had been killed, including one in the frontline town of Toretsk where Russian forces have gained ground after a long lull in fighting there.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said on Thursday Russian forces were trying to dislodge its troops from the nearby villages of Shumy and New York.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc",

Since the February 2022 invasion, Ukraine's energy sector has sustained billions in direct losses. This overview details significant attacks from March to June 2023, highlighting the extensive damage and resilience of Ukraine's power grid.\n\nRussia renewed a campaign of aerial attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities in March, which Kyiv says has knocked out half of its power generating capacity and forced Ukraine to introduce rolling blackouts in the capital and across the country. Russia says energy infrastructure is a legitimate military target and denies targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure. The attacks have spurred concerns about the resilience of the ailing power system this winter.\n\nThe Kyiv School of Economics estimates Ukraine's energy sector has sustained $16.1 billion in direct losses since Russia's February 2022 invasion, including $8.5 billion from the destruction of electricity generating plants, $2.1 billion from disruption to transmission facilities and $3.3 billion from damaged oil and gas infrastructure. Ukrainian authorities often do not disclose which plants have been hit or how badly for security reasons.\n\nHere is an overview of each attack this year. MARCH 22\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine with 88 missiles and 63 Shahed drones, of which only 37 and 55 were shot down, according to Kyiv. The wave was described by officials as Russia's largest airstrike on its energy infrastructure in two years of war. The attack struck Ukraine's largest dam, the DniproHES hydroelectric power facility in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, eight times. At least five people were killed and more than a million others were left without power.\n\nPrime Minister Denys Shmyhal said around 20 substations and electricity stations had also been hit. DTEK energy group said it lost 50% of its generating capacity in the attack. The 10-unit Zmiivska thermal plant in northeastern Kharkiv region was destroyed.\n\nMARCH 24 An underground natural gas storage site in western Ukraine was attacked, energy company Naftogaz said.\n\nMARCH 29 A major Russian missile and drone attack hit thermal and hydro power plants in central and western Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said its air force had intercepted 58 of 60 drones and 26 of 39 missiles of various types in the attack. Five of the six DTEK power stations sustained serious damage, the company said. The Kaniv hydroelectric power plant was among the targets along with the Dniester hydroelectric plant.\n\nAPRIL 10 A Russian missile and drone attack damaged energy facilities in the Black Sea region of Odesa and the nearby city of Mykolaiv, causing blackouts. The Air Force said Russia launched 17 drones and three missiles in the attacks. Fourteen drones and two of the missiles were downed, Ukraine said.\n\nAPRIL 11 Russian overnight strikes completely destroyed the large Trypilska thermal power plant outside Kyiv, a major supplier for the regions of Kyiv, Cherkasy and Zhytomyr. The Trypilska plant was the biggest energy facility near Kyiv and was built to have a capacity of 1,800 megawatts. The Air Force commander said Ukraine shot down 18 incoming missiles and 39 drones. A total of 82 missiles and drones were used in total.\n\nAPRIL 12 Attacks by Russian drones caused a fire at an energy facility in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region and damaged critical infrastructure in the southern Kherson region. Ukraine said it shot down 16 of 17 incoming drones. Russia also used a Kh-59 guided air missile for the attack, Kyiv said.\n\nAPRIL 27 Russian missiles pounded power facilities in central and western Ukraine, officials said. Ukrainian air defences brought down 21 of the 34 incoming missiles. DTEK said four of its six thermal power plants were attacked again.\n\nMAY 8 Russia hit critical energy infrastructure in the Stryi district, where Ukraine has a major underground gas storage site, and a power generation facility in Chervonohrad district in western Ukraine. Air defences brought down 39 of the 55 incoming missiles and 20 of 21 drones, Ukraine said.\n\nMAY 31 A Russian missile attack destroyed a power facility and damaged the power grid in Kyiv, DTEK said. Russia launched 53 missiles and 46 drones. Ukrainian air defences destroyed 35 missiles and all drones.\n\nJUNE 1 Russia launched a barrage of missiles and drones that damaged energy facilities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine. The attack damaged energy facilities in the east, centre, and west, grid operator Ukrenergo said. The Air Force said it shot down 35 of 53 Russian missiles and 46 of 47 attack drones in the attack. DTEK said two of its thermal power plants had been hit and equipment \"seriously damaged\".\n\nJUNE 20 A missile and drone attack hit energy infrastructure in four eastern and central regions, Ukrenergo said.

My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on the latest barrage but Moscow insists that its forces do not target civilian infrastructures.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has, however, acknowledged retaliatory attacks on energy sites in response to a wave of Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian oil facilities, mainly storage sites.\n\nIn the latest Ukrainian attack on Russian territory, the governor of Russia's Krasnodar region, which borders the annexed Crimean peninsula, announced one woman had been killed in a drone attack targeting oil facilities.\n\nAmong the areas struck was the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban in Krasnodar region, where the woman was killed, governor Venyamin Kondratyev said.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said it had downed 15 Ukrainian drones that also targeted oil storage depots in the southern Adygea republic and in the Tambov region.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Ukraine but sources in its security services have claimed responsibility for previous similar attacks, with the aim of hurting Russian oil revenues.\n\n- 'Critical infrastructure' -\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia had launched nine missiles and 27 Iranian-designed attack drones, and that air defence systems had downed all the projectiles except four missiles.\n\nIt also confirmed that \"critical infrastructure\" facilities were targeted, including in the Dnipropetrovsk region, one of the regions in which DTEK operates.\n\nIt said air defence systems were also activated in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv and Kyiv, among others.\n\nRussia has meanwhile stepped up fatal artillery attacks on embattled frontline regions of Ukraine, in the south and the east of the country.\n\nThe governor of the southern Kherson region announced on Thursday morning that one person had been killed and three wounded over the last 24 hours.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a northeastern region where Russia recently launched a surprise ground offensive, the governor said one woman had been killed by Russian fire.\n\nAnd in the eastern Donetsk region, the governor said two people had been killed, one in the frontline town of Toretsk where Russian forces have gained ground after attacking following a long lull in fighting there.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com",

Moscow has said energy facilities are a legitimate military target and that some of the strikes were retaliation for Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv have for months been appealing to Ukraine's allies to supply more air defences against the air strikes carried out by Russia throughout the nearly 28-month-old full-scale invasion.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said it shot down five out of nine missiles and all 27 drones launched by Russia over 10 Ukrainian regions during Thursday's attack.\n\nPrivate power company DTEK said one of its thermal power plants suffered significant damage during what it said was the seventh large-scale attack on its infrastructure since March 22.\n\n\"Enemy missiles hit a DTEK power station already damaged in previous attacks... We urgently need to close our skies or Ukraine faces a serious crisis this winter. My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" said the company's CEO, Maxim Timchenko.\n\nNational grid operator Ukrenergo said the attack would lead to an increase in scheduled blackouts on Thursday.\n\nThe military said the attack mostly targeted eastern Ukraine and in particular the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nDnipropetrovsk's governor said five drones and four missiles were shot down over the region. Three men were wounded in the attack, which also damaged seven homes, he said.\n\nSerhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said air defences shot down all incoming aerial targets on their approach to the capital, and no damage or injuries were reported in the city.\n\nAir defences also downed four drones over the central region of Vinnytsia, where debris damaged a critical infrastructure object, the regional governor said without identifying it.\n\nReporting by Anastasiia Malenko and Tom Balmforth; Editing by Christian Schmollinger, Stephen Coates, Timothy Heritage and

Air defences intercepted all the drones and five cruise missiles, it added.\n\nThe attack hit power structures in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv and Vinnytsia regions of Ukraine, causing \"extensive damage\", according to the national power company Ukrenergo. Seven workers were injured, it said.\n\nUkrenergo announced extended blackouts across the country despite receiving electricity imports and help with emergency supplies from European countries.\n\nPrivate energy company DTEK said one of its power plants was hit in the overnight attack but did not specify its location.\n\nThree company employees were injured and the plant's equipment was severely damaged, DTEK said on social media.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, authorities in two regions reported fires at oil storage depots after drone attacks, two days after a Ukrainian strike started a huge blaze at another refinery.\n\nThe overnight drone attacks were carried out by Ukraine's Security Service, known by its acronym SBU, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nThe attacks triggered fires at the facilities, which processed and stored crude oil and its derivatives used to supply the Russian army, the official said.\n\nThe head of Russia's Adygea region, Murat Kumpilov, said a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in the town of Enem that was later extinguished.\n\nThe governor of the Tambov region, Maxim Yegorov, said an oil reservoir was set ablaze at an oil depot there.\n\nKrasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said a drone hit a private house in the town of Slavyansk, killing a woman.\n\nRussia's Ministry of Defence said air defences downed 15 Ukrainian drones over three regions but did not mention any damage.\n\nThe ministry said it has shot down more than 26,000 Ukrainian drones since the start of the war.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot", "type":

The attacks have spurred concerns about the resilience of the ailing power system this winter.\n\nThe Kyiv School of Economics estimates Ukraine's energy sector has sustained $16.1 billion in direct losses since Russia's February 2022 invasion, including $8.5 billion from the destruction of electricity generating plants, $2.1 billion from disruption to transmission facilities and $3.3 billion from damaged oil and gas infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian authorities often do not disclose which plants have been hit or how badly for security reasons.\n\nHere is an overview of each attack this year.\n\nMARCH 22\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine with 88 missiles and 63 Shahed drones, of which only 37 and 55 were shot down, according to Kyiv. The wave was described by officials as Russia's largest airstrike on its energy infrastructure in two years of war.\n\nThe attack struck Ukraine's largest dam, the DniproHES hydroelectric power facility in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, eight times. At least five people were killed and more than a million others were left without power.\n\nPrime Minister Denys Shmyhal said around 20 substations and electricity stations had also been hit.\n\nDTEK energy group said it lost 50% of its generating capacity in the attack. The 10-unit Zmiivska thermal plant in northeastern Kharkiv region was destroyed.\n\nMARCH 24\n\nAn underground natural gas storage site in western Ukraine was attacked, energy company Naftogaz said.\n\nMARCH 29\n\nA major Russian missile and drone attack hit thermal and hydro power plants in central and western Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said its air force had intercepted 58 of 60 drones and 26 of 39 missiles of various types in the attack. Five of the six DTEK power stations sustained serious damage, the company said. The Kaniv hydroelectric power plant was among the targets along with the Dniester hydroelectric plant.\n\nAPRIL 10\n\nA Russian missile and drone attack damaged energy facilities in the Black Sea region of Odesa and the nearby city of Mykolaiv, causing blackouts. The Air Force said Russia launched 17 drones and three missiles in the attacks. Fourteen drones and two of the missiles were downed, Ukraine said.\n\nAPRIL 11\n\nRussian overnight strikes completely destroyed the large Trypilska thermal power plant outside Kyiv, a major supplier for the regions of Kyiv, Cherkasy and Zhytomyr. The Trypilska plant was the biggest energy facility near Kyiv and was built to have a capacity of 1,800 megawatts. The Air Force commander said Ukraine shot down 18 incoming missiles and 39 drones. A total of 82 missiles and drones were used in total.\n\nAPRIL 12\n\nAttacks by Russian drones caused a fire at an energy facility in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region and damaged critical infrastructure in the southern Kherson region. Ukraine said it shot down 16 of 17 incoming drones. Russia also used a Kh-59 guided air missile for the attack, Kyiv said.\n\nAPRIL 27\n\nRussian missiles pounded power facilities in central and western Ukraine, officials said. Ukrainian air defences brought down 21 of the 34 incoming missiles. DTEK said four of its six thermal power plants were attacked again.\n\nMAY 8\n\nRussia hit critical energy infrastructure in the Stryi district, where Ukraine has a major underground gas storage site, and a power generation facility in Chervonohrad district in western Ukraine. Air defences brought down 39 of the 55 incoming missiles and 20 of 21 drones, Ukraine said.\n\nMAY 31\n\nA Russian missile attack destroyed a power facility and damaged the power grid in Kyiv, DTEK said. Russia launched 53 missiles and 46 drones. Ukrainian air defences destroyed 35 missiles and all drones.\n\nJUNE 1\n\nRussia launched a barrage of missiles and drones that damaged energy facilities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine. The attack damaged energy facilities in the east, centre, and west, grid operator Ukrenergo said. The Air Force said it shot down 35 of 53 Russian missiles and 46 of 47 attack drones in the attack. DTEK said two of its thermal power plants had been hit and equipment \"seriously damaged\".\n\nJUNE 20\n\nA missile and drone attack hit energy infrastructure in four eastern and central regions, Ukrenergo said. DTEK said one of its thermal power plants was seriously damaged. The attack injured three power workers and caused blackouts in some areas. The air force said it shot down five out of nine missiles and all 27 drones fired in the attack.

The strikes, it said, amounted to the seventh large-scale attack on its infrastructure since March 22.\n\nNational grid operator Ukrenergo said the attack would lead to an increase in the quantity of scheduled blackouts on Thursday.\n\nThe military said the attack mostly targeted eastern Ukraine and in particular the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nThe region's governor said five drones and four missiles were shot down over the region. Three men were wounded in the attack, which also damaged seven homes, he said.\n\nSerhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said air defences shot down all incoming aerial targets on their approach to the capital, and no damage or injuries were reported in the city.\n\nAir defences also downed four drones over the central region of Vinnytsia, where debris damaged a critical infrastructure object, the regional governor said without identifying it.\n\n(Reporting by Anastasiia Malenko and Tom Balmforth;

It said three workers were injured in the attack.\n\nThe latest wave of Russian strikes has also increased the number of scheduled power outages for domestic consumers, Ukrenerho said, adding, however, that electricity supply for critical infrastructure will not be restricted.\n\nSeparately, the air force reported that Russia attacked Ukraine with nine missiles and 27 drones. Ukrainian air defenses shot down all the drones and five missiles, the military said.\n\nRussia has systematically targeted Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure, causing enormous damage and limiting electricity supply for the civilian population, prompting regular blackouts.\n\nIn return, Ukrainian drones have struck deeper inside Russia, damaging energy facilities critical for Moscow's military effort, mainly oil installations.\n\nOn June 20, drones belonging to Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) struck a fuel and lubricants warehouse in Russia's Tambov region, some 400 kilometers southeast of Moscow, and a LUKoil oil depot in the North Caucasus region of Adygea, setting both on fire, a Ukrainian security source told RFE/RL.\n\nThe Baza channel, which is linked to Russian security services, confirmed that a fire had broken out at the Platonov oil depot in Tambov.\n\nVeniamin Kondratyev, the governor of the Russian region of Krasnodar, said a private house was completely destroyed, and a local resident was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban.\n\nThe SBU told RFE/RL that its drones had carried out almost three dozen

Three company employees were injured and the plant's equipment was severely damaged, DTEK said on social media.\n\nAmong the most damaging recent strikes on Ukraine's energy supply were an April barrage that damaged Kyiv's largest thermal power plant and a massive attack on May 8 that targeted power generation and transmission facilities in several regions.\n\nRolling blackouts have affected Ukrainian households and industry.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, authorities in two regions reported fires at oil storage depots after drone attacks, two days after a Ukrainian strike started a huge blaze at another refinery.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nUkraine has in recent months stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals in an effort to disrupt the Kremlin's war machine.\n\nMurat Kumpilov, head of Russia's Adygea region, said a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in the town of Enem that was later extinguished.\n\nThe head of the Tambov region, Maxim Yegorov, said an oil reservoir went ablaze at an oil depot there.\n\nKrasnodar region Gov.

rolling blackouts and import supplies from neighbouring EU states.\n\n\"The enemy attacked a number of energy infrastructure facilities,\" the energy ministry said, adding that the barrage of Russian projectiles targeted energy-linked sites in four regions, including the capital, without elaborating.\n\nAFP journalists in the capital heard air raid sirens ringing out over the capital in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nDTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said the aerial attacks had caused \"serious damage\" at one of its thermal power plants, and that three of its employees had been wounded in the attack.\n\n\"This is already the seventh mass attack on the company's thermal power plant in the last three months,\" the company said.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that those attacks have halved generator capacity in the war-battered country compared to one year ago and urged allies to send more air defence systems to protect vital infrastructure.", "source": {"uri":

My plea to allies is to help us defend our energy system and rebuild in time,\" he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on the latest barrage but Moscow says its forces do not target civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has, however, acknowledged retaliatory attacks on energy sites in response to a wave of Ukrainian cross-border attacks on Russian oil facilities, mainly storage sites.\n\n\"These facilities processed and stored raw materials and finished products, which were later used by the Russian army,\" the source said, vowing more attacks on Russian oil facilities, with the aim of denting the Kremlin's war chest.\n\nThe energy ministry said a total of seven employees at energy facilities had been wounded and that more than 200,000 people had been temporarily cut off in the Vinnytsia region.\n\n\"There will be no outages for critical infrastructure companies,\" it added.\n\nRussia has meanwhile stepped up fatal artillery attacks on

The assault damaged infrastructure in Vinnytsia, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and Kyiv regions, according to the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\nThe attack involved a combination of missiles and drones, including:\n\n\"The enemy's air attack was repelled by fighter aircraft, anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare equipment of the Air Forces, and mobile fire groups of the Defense Forces of Ukraine,\" the report indicates.\n\nUkraine's energy operator, Ukrenergo, has reported significant damage to the country's civil energy infrastructure. Efforts are ongoing to assess the full impact.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said this month the aerial bombardments have halved the country's electricity production compared to a year ago, disrupting and limiting supplies for millions.\n\nIn Vinnytsia, regional head Serhii Borzov confirmed a critical infrastructure site was hit by drones. While there were no injuries, emergency measures were promptly implemented.\n\nKyiv also came under attack. According to the Kyiv City Military Administration, Shahed drones attempted to strike from the northeast but were intercepted by air defence forces. No casualties or significant damage were reported in the capital.\n\nDTEK, a major energy company, reported that one of its thermal power plants was struck, injuring three employees and causing severe equipment damage.\n\nThis marks the seventh major attack on DTEK facilities in the past three months, with over 180 attacks since the invasion began, resulting in 53 injuries and three fatalities among workers.\n\nA senior Ukrainian energy official has recently warned that scheduled power outages and emergency blackouts will intensify over the coming weeks, after a string of Russian attacks crippled Ukrainian electricity generation.\n\n\"Over the next few weeks, the situation will be much tougher than it is today,\" the head of national grid operator Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kydrytsky said in an interview late on Sunday.\n\nHe said periods during which Ukrainians might not have power were likely to be extended by up to 12 hours per day and that outages could become more \"stringent\".\"This situation will continue until the end of July,\" he said in the interview, broadcast on state media.\n\nOleksandr Kharchenko, the chairman of the Center for Energy Research, noted that Ukraine's energy infrastructure is currently operating at a critically low capacity, suggesting potential winter blackouts lasting up to 20 hours without light or heating under the worst conditions.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label":

All 27 drones and five missiles were shot down by the air defense.\n\nThe Ukrenergo said it would expand power limitation restrictions in the wake of the attacks. The power cuts, however, will not apply to critical infrastructure facilities.\n\nSince March 22, Russia carried out seven major missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's power generation and transmission infrastructure. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrenergo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukrenergo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv Oblast"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblasts_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblasts of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnipropetrovsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dnipropetrovsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dnipropetrovsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_combat_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned combat aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K720_Iskander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "9K720 Iskander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666868", "eventUri": "eng-9666868", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 6, "textEnd": 13}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-22", "textStart": 1228, "textEnd": 1236}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

He emphasized that planned deliveries to Taiwan and Israel will not be affected by this move, and that the other nations waiting for their shipments were \"broadly supportive\" when they were informed of Washington's decision.\n\n\"Obviously more is needed and it's needed now,\" Kirby told journalists during a phone briefing with journalists. \"So, as a result, the United States government has made the difficult but necessary decision to reprioritize near-term planned deliveries of foreign military sales to other countries of, particularly, Patriot and NASAMS missiles to go to Ukraine instead.\"\n\nA massive overnight Russian missile and drone attack damaged energy facilities throughout Ukraine, a day after the country announced rolling blackouts because of war-related power shortages.\n\nUkraine's national power provider Ukrenergo said early Thursday an overnight attack on a thermal plant caused serious damage and wounded three workers.\n\n'Equipment at facilities in Vinnytsia, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kyiv regions got damaged,' the Ukrenergo statement added.\n\nA seller shines a flashlight during a power outage in an underground shopping mall in central Kyiv, Ukraine, June 19, 2024.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukrenergo announced hourly rolling blackouts would be implemented throughout the country. Russian drone and missile strikes have cut Ukraine's power-generating capabilities to half of what they were last year, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month.\n\nIn his daily address, Zelenskyy said government officials were looking for ways to improve the situation.\n\n'We are preparing solutions that will ensure a more reliable passage of the heating season and give people more opportunities to get through this extremely difficult period, in terms of energy shortages and outages,' he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said it shot down five out of nine missiles and all 27 drones launched by Russia over 10 Ukrainian regions during Thursday's attack.\n\nThe military said Russia mostly targeted eastern Ukraine, specifically the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nDnipropetrovsk's governor said three men were injured in the attack, which also damaged seven homes.\n\nIn Russia, the governor of the southern Krasnodar region said an overnight Ukrainian drone attack targeted oil storage facilities.\n\nGovernor Venyamin Kondratyev said a woman was killed in an attack on the city of Slavyansk-na-Kubani.\n\nRussia's defense agreement with North Korea this week, prompted a bipartisan group of US Senators to renew calls to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n'This is one of the most important decisions our generation of politicians will make, because if we made Russia state sponsored terrorism, it would change the momentum in Ukraine overnight. It would be a morale boost to the Ukrainians. It would make it hard for anybody to do business with Russia, and it would further isolate this regime,' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters Thursday.\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he had spoken with the Biden administration about the effort to secure the designation but has not discussed it since the announcement of Russia's security partnership.\n\n\"It is deeply scary, because it signals cooperation, not only against Ukraine, but against the United States,\" Blumenthal said.\n\nMaterial from Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.",

Earlier on Thursday, an official in the Adigeia region in the Caucasus also reported a fire in a fuel depot.\n\nOn Tuesday, drones struck a depot in the town of Azov, near Rostov-on-Don, and the fire was still raging on Wednesday. According to intelligence sources in kyiv, all these attacks were carried out by the SBU, the Ukrainian secret service.\n\nUkraine increases drone attacks against Russian fuel depots after reducing operations targeting refineries, the impact of which on markets and global oil prices was potentially more important. Russia has around thirty large refineries and hundreds of fuel depots.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday called for installing solar panels \"in every school and hospital as soon as possible\", with Ukraine experiencing increasing electricity shortages due to Russian strikes on its energy infrastructure.\n\n\"Solar panels, smart meters and energy storage units must be installed in every school and hospital as soon as possible. Regional military administrations have been tasked with overseeing these measures at the local level\", the president said in a statement on social media.\n\nThe United States \"has made the difficult but necessary decision\"to now give priority to Ukraine over other allies in terms of delivering missiles for anti-aircraft defense, a White House spokesperson said Thursday.\n\nConsequently, exports to other countries of Patriot and NASAMS missiles in particular will \"delayed\", said John Kirby, spokesperson for the National Security Council.\n\nRussian missiles and drones damaged energy infrastructure in several Ukrainian regions on Thursday, as Moscow continued its campaign of systematic destruction of the country's power grid, Ukraine's Energy Ministry said.\n\nAccording to the ministry, three employees were injured in the attack, which led to power outages in some regions. Ukrainian private company DTEK said one of its thermal power plants was seriously damaged. According to Kiev, massive drone and missile attacks carried out since this winter by Russia, taking advantage of delays in the delivery of Western weapons to Ukraine, have knocked out about half of the country's electricity-generating capacity.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said it shot down five of the nine missiles and 27 drones fired by Russia on Thursday. She specified that ten regions had been targeted, particularly that of Dnipropetrovsk where the three employees were injured. According to the head of kyiv's military administration, Serhi Popko, all projectiles aimed at the capital were intercepted and no damage was reported.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned Thursday that South Korea's direct arms shipment to Ukraine would be a \"very serious error\", threatening Seoul with retaliatory measures in the event of such a decision.\n\n\"Providing lethal weapons to the war zone in Ukraine would be a very serious mistake.

Reacting to this announcement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Bucharest for a decision which will \"enable to better protect our people and our critical infrastructure\" .\n\nAt the

They will also instruct officials in Brussels to use the cash to provide loans to Ukraine worth \"approximately\" \u20ac50 billion \"to support Ukraine's current and future military, budget and reconstruction needs.\"\n\nThe cash and military support is much needed in Ukraine, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging allies to step up in the face of more and more strikes on critical infrastructure.\n\nOver the past three months, Russia has switched tactics from targeting electricity substations, which Ukraine had become adept at quickly repairing, to trying to flatten entire power stations. The steady barrage of rockets and drones has destroyed a significant share of power generation in several Ukrainian regions, turning the country from a net exporter of electricity into being dependent on the EU to keep the lights on.\n\nOn Wednesday night, state energy firm Ukrenergo reported that Russian strikes had damaged energy infrastructure in four regions, including Kyiv, sparking new blackouts. DTEK, the country's largest private electricity firm, said that one of its thermal power plants had been seriously damaged.\n\nUkraine has been calling for additional support in repairing its crippled generating facilities ahead of peak power usage seasons in the summer and winter.\n\n\"We have power outages virtually every day while consumption is quite low, even before winter heating season has arrived,\" Ukrenergo chief Volodymyr Kudrytskyi told POLITICO.\n\n\"The road to save the Ukrainian energy sector and protect millions of people from being disconnected is to unlock investments from Western countries and Western companies to Ukraine,\" he added. \"We're not asking for humanitarian support, we're asking them to come to Ukraine and earn money, while increasing our production

Authorities reported three injured workers at one of the affected facilities. In Odesa and the surrounding region, an air alert was declared, with city officials warning of a potential ballistic missile attack. However, there were no reports of destruction or casualties in Kyiv, as air defenses successfully intercepted all drones, according to the air force.\n\nVolodymyr Kudrytsky, head of the Ukrainian energy company Ukrenergo, stated that the country's energy system will face significant challenges in the coming weeks. Power outages will persist, affecting daily life. Alexander Kharchenko, director of the Center for Energy Research, warned that Ukrainians could experience power shortages for at least two more winters. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky reassured citizens that the authorities are working tirelessly to ensure electricity and heating throughout the winter.\n\nIn response, Ukraine conducted a series of drone strikes targeting oil storage facilities in Russia. These attacks resulted in fires at two oil warehouses, one in the North Caucasus region of Adygea and another in the Tambov region, approximately 500 kilometers south of Moscow.

Critical infrastructure would not be impacted, it added.\n\nUkrainian officials have been forced to ramp up imports of electricity from neighbouring European Union countries to make up the shortfalls and have urged allies to help restore the embattled energy sector.\n\nKyiv has also called on its allies to bolster Ukrainian air defence systems to protect critical infrastructure from Russian missile and drone barrages.\n\nUkrenergo had warned this week that the outages were likely to become more serious in coming weeks.

that scheduled power outages and emergency blackouts will intensify over the coming weeks, after a string of Russian attacks crippled Ukrainian electricity generation.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said this month the aerial bombardments have halved the country's electricity production compared to a year ago, disrupting and limiting supplies for millions.\n\n\"Over the next few weeks, the situation will be much tougher than it is today,\" the head of national grid operator Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kydrytsky said in an interview late on Sunday.\n\nHe said periods during which Ukrainians might not have power were likely to be extended by up to 12 hours per day and that outages could become more \"stringent\".\n\n\"This situation will continue until the end of July,\" he said in the interview, broadcast on state media.\n\nIn addition to systematic strikes on thermal and hydroelectric plants, he said there could be more outages due to maintainance work on nuclear plants and to weather conditions.\n\nScheduled outages could also be imposed during peak consumption periods and be \"quite serious\", Kydrytsky said.\n\nUkrainian officials have been forced to ramp up imports of electricity from neighbouring European Union countries to make up the shortfalls and have urged allies to help restoring the embattled energy sector.\n\nKyiv has also called on its allies to bolster Ukrainian air defence systems to safeguard critical infrastructure from Russian missile and drone barrages.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors":

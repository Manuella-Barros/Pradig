I knew if I kept the ball low on his backhand side and just kind of worked my way into the court, it would be the right thing to do. I think I did this thing very, very well today.\"\n\nDimitrov will bid for a place in the semi-finals for the second straight year when he faces Japan's Yuichi Sugita, who reached his first Masters 1000 quarter-final.\n\nThe unseeded Sugita overcame Russian Karen Khachanov 6-7 (0), 6-3, 6-3 before a thunderstorm forced play to be suspended for more than two hours.\n\nThe 28-year-old Japanese captured his first ATP World Tour title at the Antalya Open in July, adding to three ATP Challenger Tour events won in 2017.\n\n\"He's been playing really well,\" said Dimitrov. \"He's going to be definitely a tough opponent to play.\"\n\nDimitrov got off to a great start by opening up a 3-0 lead against Del Potro.\n\nDel Potro mirrored Dimitrov by winning the first three games of the second set but could not convert three set point chances at 5-4, before the Argentine began to struggle in the heat.\n\nA doctor was called at the 6-5 changeover, but Del Potro was determined to finish the match.\n\nDimitrov improved to 31-14 for the season, which includes two ATP World Tour titles.\n\nIn later games, John Isner never dropped a service game on his way to a 7-6 (4), 7-5 win over fellow American Frances Tiafoe.\n\nIsner rocketed two aces to close out the match and punch his card to the quarterfinals, where he will face another American in Jared Donaldson.\n\nDonaldson, who defeated Nikoloz Basilashvili in straight sets on Thursday, will be one of four unseeded players in the quarters following a series of upsets early in the tournament.\n\nThird seed Dominic Thiem needed two tie

I knew if I keep the ball low on his backhand side and just kind of work my way into the court, it would have been the right thing to do.I think I did this thing very, very well today. The short slice really made him very uncomfortable, and he was giving me a lot of short balls, so I could start moving him with my forehand. It was also a bit of a mind game, because we know our game pretty well.\"\n\nDimitrov, who made the semifinals a year ago, now faces the surprising Yuichi Sugita. The Japanese star stunned Jack Sock then on Thursday knocked out young Russian Karen Khachanov 6-7(0), 6-3, 6-3.\n\nIn an American generational showdown, John Isner took down Frances Tiafoe 7-6(4), 7-5. The 2013 finalist now meets a third straight wildcard countryman in Jared Donaldson on Friday in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe 20-year-old Donaldson reached his first career ATP final defeating Nikolaz Basilishvili 6-4, 7-6(4).\n\n\"I played Jared once,\" said Isner. \"It was on grass a couple years ago, so it's been a while since we played. I can't really take much stock into that match. He was two years younger than he is now. He's playing some very good tennis. It's very impressive to see. He works really hard.\n\n\"I don't know if you guys agree, maybe he doesn't quite get the credit that some of the other young guys that he's with, and he's the highest-ranked one right now. He's certainly doing all the right things. I see him on the practice court. I see him working on his game, doing stuff in the gym. He has a good team around him. I think Jan-Michael Gambill is obviously doing a very good job for him.\n\n\"Tomorrow's match will be tough, but I'm playing well, and I expect it to be a very tough match for him, as well. Just look forward to it. It's going to be a good match.\"\n\nDavid Ferrer continued his return to form topping countryman Pablo Carreno Busta 6-4, 6-4. Next for Ferrer is No. 3 seed Dominic Thiem who was a 7-6, 7-6 victory over Adrian Mannarino.\n\n\"Against Ferrer it's going to be a long and physically tough match,\" said Thiem. \"He's playing way better again, including a great match against Federer last week. It's going to be really tough but I've got some more confidence again and I hope I'm ready.\"\n\nIn the evening, Nick Kyrgios and Ivo Karlovic were suspended at 4-3 in the first set while Rafael Nadal and Albert Ramos-Vinolas never got on the court as continued rain forced the cancellation of all play just after 11pm.\n\nSo tomorrow, Nadal is looking to have to win two matches to keep his hopes for a second Cincinnati title alive.\n\nNot Before 9:00 pm\n\nATP - [1] R. Nadal (ESP) or A. Ramos-Vinolas (ESP) vs N. Kyrgios (AUS) or I.

{"id": 243274616, "title": "President Biden concedes missteps, vows to press on despite calls to quit", "text": "By Skylar Woodhouse and Akayla GardnerPresident Joe Biden said he is committed to winning the November election, brushing aside mounting calls from prominent Democrats to step aside following his disastrous debate against Republican Donald Trump. Biden, 81, on Friday acknowledged limitations caused by his age and his sputtering performance the day prior against Trump. But he declared he was up to the task of serving another four years in the White House. \u201cI give you my word: I would not be running again if I didn\u2019t believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job,\u201d the president said at a campaign rally in North Carolina. \u201cI intend to win this state in November.\u201dThe president told supporters \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man, to state the obvious,\u201d leading the crowd to cheer in support of him.\u201cI don\u2019t walk as easy as I used to. I don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I know what I do know \u2014 I know how to tell the truth, I know right from wrong and I know how to do this job.\u201dAt a political fundraiser later Friday at an LGBTQ gala in Manhattan, Biden again defended his candidacy.\u201cI know how to get things done, and I know what millions of Americans know \u2014 when you get knocked down you get back up,\u201d the president said. Several Democratic lawmakers and donors \u2014 as well as some of Biden\u2019s favorite television hosts and columnists \u2014 have said publicly and privately that the oldest president in US history should exit the race after delivering a debate performance that cemented public perceptions that he is not capable of handling the rigors of a second term as commander-in-chief. Trump attempted to harness momentum following the debate with his own rally in Virginia, ridiculing Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u201cDespite the fact that Crooked Joe Biden spent the entire week at Camp David resting, working, studying \u2014 he studied very hard. He studied so hard that he didn\u2019t know what the hell he was doing,\u201d the former president said. \u201cMany people are saying that after last night\u2019s performance that Joe Biden is leaving the race. But the fact is, I don\u2019t really believe that because he does better in polls than any of the Democrats they\u2019re talking about.\u201dBiden\u2019s comments, however, made it clear he will not accede to pressure to make way for another Democratic nominee. His comments also signaled he is unlikely to drastically change his campaign\u2019s approach, despite committing one of the biggest missteps in modern political history at Thursday\u2019s debate. Former President Barack Obama, who discouraged Biden from running for president after the death of his son in 2015, on Friday offered his full backing to his onetime No. 2. Obama, among the most popular Democrats, has campaigned for Biden in the last two elections. \u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\u201d Obama said in a statement, referring to his shaky first debate in 2012. \u201cThis election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.\u201dFirst lady Jill Biden, speaking at a fundraiser in Greenwich Village hosted by author Adriana Trigiani, acknowledged the debate was on the minds of attendees \u2014 but relayed the private support she had offered her husband.\u201cAs Joe said earlier today, he\u2019s not a young man. And you know, after last night\u2019s debate, he said, \u2018You know, Jill, I don\u2019t know what happened. I didn\u2019t feel that great.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Look, Joe, we are not going to let 90 minutes define the four years that you\u2019ve been president,\u2019\u201d the first lady said.The president displayed more energy on Friday, though bouts of coughing interrupted his speech \u2014 the result of what people familiar with the matter said was a cold. Biden seized on opportunities he missed during the debate to land punches against Trump on abortion rights, the former president\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election and his felony conviction in a New York hush-money case. \u201cI thought to myself Donald Trump isn\u2019t just a convicted felon, Donald Trump is a one-man crime wave,\u201d Biden said. The president said \u201cAmerica itself is at stake\u201d in the November election, citing Trump\u2019s pledge to carry out retribution on his political enemies if he wins another term. \u201cDonald Trump will destroy democracy. I will defend it,\u201d Biden said. Both Biden and Trump chose to campaign after the debate in states that are stretches to win, signaling they want to expand the map of competitive areas this fall. No Democratic presidential nominee has won North Carolina since 2008 and a Republican hasn\u2019t prevailed in Virginia in two decades.\u201cIf we win here, we win the election,\u201d Biden said.", "summary": "Trump attempted to harness momentum following the debate with his own rally in Virginia, ridiculing Biden's debate performance", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/president-biden-concedes-missteps-vows-to-press-on-despite-calls-to-quit-124062900075_1.html", "image": "https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-06/29/full/1719629405-0833.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:00:26", "author": "Bloomberg", "authors": ["Bloomberg"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.311}

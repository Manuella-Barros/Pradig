{"id": 243265438, "title": "Today in Politics: Amit Shah kicks off BJP\u2019s Assembly poll preparations with Haryana meeting", "text": "On Saturday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah is set to begin a series of meetings as part of the BJP\u2019s preparations for the coming Assembly elections in Haryana, Jharkhand and Maharashtra, expected to be held at the end of the year. First, Shah is set to chair an organisational meeting in Haryana\u2019s Panchkula to discuss the Assembly polls and the party\u2019s strategy. \u201cThe BJP is moving forward strongly with the goal of forming the government for the third time in Haryana. Union Home Minister Amit Shah is coming to Panchkula on June 29 to hold a state executive meeting,\u201d a party statement said. In 2019, months after the BJP won the Lok Sabha elections in a landslide, the party struggled in the Assembly polls and fell short of the majority mark in the 90-member House. The party had then needed the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) to form the government. However, there has since been more upheaval in the state for the BJP \u2013 ahead of these Lok Sabha elections, the BJP and JJP broke ties and the saffron party replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as the Chief Minister with Nayab Singh Saini, keeping caste equations in mind. Moreover, the Lok Sabha polls saw the BJP\u2019s tally get halved \u2013 the party had swept the state\u2019s 10 parliamentary seats in 2019 and fell to five seats this year, with the Congress winning the remaining five. After Haryana, Shah is expected to hold similar meetings in Maharashtra and Jharkhand following the conclusion of the ongoing Parliament session on July 4. Meanwhile, CM Nitish Kumar is set to chair a national executive meeting of the Janata Dal (United), which recently returned to the NDA fold ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, in New Delhi on Saturday. Party insiders said during the meeting, various topics including an analysis of the Lok Sabha elections, strategies for the Assembly polls in 2025, and the party\u2019s demand for Bihar to get special category status will be discussed. All-party meet in Maharashtra on reservation With the Assembly\u2019s Monsoon Session underway, an all-party meeting has been scheduled at the Vidhan Bhavan on Saturday to discuss the ongoing Maratha and Other Backward Class (OBC) reservation issue. The controversial draft notification on the issuance of Kunbi certificates to Marathas and their blood relations had been aggressively opposed by OBC leaders, two of whom went on a hunger strike for 10 days before meeting government officials. Reservation politics has led to a sharp polarisation between Marathas and OBCs in the state, especially in the Marathwada region. Amid the Marathas\u2019 call for a reservation within the OBC category, the OBC agitation against it has been gaining momentum in the state recently. AAP nationwide protests The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will hold a protest across the country on Saturday against the arrest of party national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by the CBI in connection with the excise policy case. Kejriwal was arrested on Wednesday. \u201cThe AAP workers across the country will hold massive \u2018dharna\u2019 against the BJP for misuse of investigation agencies and Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s arrest on Saturday,\u201d said AAP national general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak, adding that the CBI arrest was a \u201cploy\u201d to keep Kerjiwal in jail at a time when the BJP \u201cfelt that Kejriwal was going to get bail from the Supreme Court\u201d. Karnataka CM to meeting PM On Saturday, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi during his three-day visit to the national capital to discuss state projects pending approval from the Centre with Union ministers. \u201cI will be meeting the Road Transport Minister (Nitin Gadkari), also Prime Minister and the Home Minister (Amit Shah). Will also try to meet the Finance Minister (Nirmala Sitharaman). The Home Minister has still not given the time and he might give today. Will also try to meet Railway Minister (Ashwini Vaishnaw) and Jal Shakti Minister (C R Paatil),\u201d Siddaramaiah told reporters on Thursday.

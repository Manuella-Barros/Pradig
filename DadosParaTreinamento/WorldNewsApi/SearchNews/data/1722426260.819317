{"id": 243323344, "title": "Dear Abby: Drug addiction, violence tearing our family apart", "text": "Dear Abby: My elderly father died recently. Although he had a variety of ailments, including heart disease, his death was unexpected. He spent many years of his life trying to save my drug-addicted, criminal sister from herself. Despite occasional periods of sobriety, she has invariably returned to her evil ways. Three days before Dad passed, he was again trying to bail her out of a situation involving people she knew who stole her car. While Dad was driving her, she lost her temper (again) and struck him multiple times as my mother (on the phone) begged her to stop. Dad died a few days later, perhaps not from the assault, but his body just said, \u201cEnough!\u201d My sister is now sinking her teeth into my mother like she did my dad, and I don\u2019t know what to do. I want Mom to cut her out of her life before this happens again, but Mom says, \u201cShe\u2019s still my daughter.\u201d Please advise. -- Better Sibling in New Jersey Dear Better Sibling: Your sister IS still your mother\u2019s daughter as she was her father\u2019s. Point out to Mom that in spite of all the years your father spent bailing your sister out, her behavior never improved. Often when we love someone, our instinct is to try to rescue them. Unfortunately, as your sister\u2019s addiction problem has proven, that rarely works. Please find where the chapters of Nar-Anon are located in your vicinity and invite your mother to go with you to some of the meetings. It is a 12-step program for family and friends of addicts. You can find the information at nar-anon.org. If you do, it could save not only your sister\u2019s life but also your mother\u2019s. Previously Dear Abby: What can I do?

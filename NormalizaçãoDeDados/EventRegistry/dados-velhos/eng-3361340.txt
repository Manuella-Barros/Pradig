Others expressed concerns that delaying further rate hikes could push inflation higher into dangerous territory.\n\nThe policy debate was revealed in minutes released Wednesday of the Fed's July 25-26 meeting. Officials eventually made a unanimous decision to keep its key policy rate unchanged.\n\nThe minutes also showed that several officials pushed for a July announcement that the Fed was ready to start reducing its massive bond holdings, a move that would likely mean slightly higher rates on mortgages and some other loans. Policymakers decided in the end to signal that it would come \"relatively soon.\"\n\nFinancial markets expect that announcement at next month's meeting, but analysts do not expect the Fed's next rate hike to come until December at the earliest. The latest reading of traders' expectations shows less than a 50-50 chance of a December hike, according to the CME Group. If inflation does not start moving higher again, they say it is likely the Fed will keep rates unchanged until next year.\n\nAt the July meeting, officials voted to keep the Fed's benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The Fed had raised rates at its March and June meetings even though inflation this year has slowed and is now further from the Fed's 2 percent goal than it was at the start of the year. In June, the Fed continued to signal that it expected to raise rates one more time this year.\n\nIn their July discussion, the minutes showed that some officials expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, even though unemployment has continued to decline. It is currently at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.\n\nOfficials worried about low inflation said that the Fed should delay any further rate hikes until it had greater assurance that the slowdown stemmed from temporary factors and that prices would climb more quickly in coming months.\n\nBut other officials worried that with the labor market already at full employment, waiting too long to raise rates again ran the risk of overshooting on the 2 percent inflation target. That would be \"costly to reverse,\" meaning that the Fed would have to raise rates more quickly and higher in the future, actions that could push the economy into a recession.\n\nThe inflation debate explored a number of issues, the minutes showed, including the possibility that long-held views on the relationship between tight labor markets and higher inflation may no longer be valid.\n\nThe Fed's next meeting is Sept. 19-20.\n\nIn an interview Monday with the Associated Press, William Dudley, head of the Fed's New York regional bank, said that the market's view that the announcement about bond reductions would come in September was \"reasonable.\"\n\nDudley said he did not expect much of an impact on financial markets because the action had been well-telegraphed by the Fed, unlike the \"taper tantrum\" incident that occurred in 2013 when bond rates temporarily spiked when markets were caught by surprise by comments from then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that the Fed was contemplating moves to reduce the size of its monthly purchases of bonds.\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet has soared five-fold -- to $4.5 trillion -- since the summer of 2008, just before the financial crisis erupted. The increase came as a result of purchases the Fed made of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The purchases were designed to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates as a way of giving the economy an extra boost after the Fed had cut its short-term rate to a record low near zero.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 100, "id": 623, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "wgt": 100, "id": 755, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "wgt": 100, "id": 1221, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303277", "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304020", "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304202", "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304730", "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "306369", "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312756", "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "314107", "label": {"eng": "Ben Bernanke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "316836", "label": {"eng": "CME Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "327901", "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_debate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "673274", "label": {"eng": "Policy debate"}}]}

It is currently at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.\n\nOfficials worried about low inflation said that the Fed should delay any further rate hikes until it had greater assurance that the slowdown stemmed from temporary factors and that prices would climb more quickly in coming months.\n\nBut other officials worried that with the labor market already at full employment, waiting too long to raise rates again ran the risk of overshooting on the 2 percent inflation target. That would be \"costly to reverse,\" meaning that the Fed would have to raise rates more quickly and higher in the future, actions that could push the economy into a recession.\n\nThe inflation debate explored a number of issues, the minutes showed, including the possibility that long-held views on the relationship between tight labor markets and higher inflation may no longer be valid.\n\nThe Fed's next meeting is Sept. 19-20.\n\nIn an interview Monday with the Associated Press, William Dudley, head of the Fed's New York regional bank, said that the market's view that the announcement about bond reductions would come in September was \"reasonable.\"\n\nDudley said he did not expect much of an impact on financial markets because the action had been well-telegraphed by the Fed, unlike the \"taper tantrum\" incident that occurred in 2013 when bond rates temporarily spiked when markets were caught by surprise by comments from then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that the Fed was contemplating moves to reduce the size of its monthly purchases of bonds.\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet has soared five-fold - to $4.5 trillion - since the summer of 2008, just before the financial crisis erupted. The increase came as a result of purchases the Fed made of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

Others expressed concerns that delaying further rate hikes could push inflation higher into dangerous territory.\n\nThe policy debate was revealed in minutes released Wednesday of the Fed's July 25-26 meeting. Officials eventually made a unanimous decision to keep its key policy rate unchanged.\n\nThe minutes also showed that several officials pushed for a July announcement that the Fed was ready to start reducing its massive bond holdings, a move that would likely mean slightly higher rates on mortgages and some other loans. Policymakers decided in the end to signal that it would come \"relatively soon.\"\n\nFinancial markets expect that announcement at next month's meeting, but analysts do not expect the Fed's next rate hike to come until December at the earliest. The latest reading of traders' expectations shows less than a 50-50 chance of a December hike, according to the CME Group. If inflation does not start moving higher again, they say it is likely the Fed will keep rates unchanged until next year.\n\nAt the July meeting, officials voted to keep the Fed's benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The Fed had raised rates at its March and June meetings even though inflation this year has slowed and is now further from the Fed's 2 percent goal than it was at the start of the year. In June, the Fed continued to signal that it expected to raise rates one more time this year.\n\nIn their July discussion, the minutes showed that some officials expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, even though unemployment has continued to decline. It is currently at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.\n\nOfficials worried about low inflation said that the Fed should delay any further rate hikes until it had greater assurance that the slowdown stemmed from temporary factors and that prices would climb more quickly in coming months.\n\nBut other officials worried that with the labor market already at full employment, waiting too long to raise rates again ran the risk of overshooting on the 2 percent inflation target. That would be \"costly to reverse,\" meaning that the Fed would have to raise rates more quickly and higher in the future, actions that could push the economy into a recession.\n\nThe inflation debate explored a number of issues, the minutes showed, including the possibility that long-held views on the relationship between tight labor markets and higher inflation may no longer be valid.\n\nThe Fed's next meeting is Sept. 19-20.\n\nIn an interview Monday with the Associated Press, William Dudley, head of the Fed's New York regional bank, said that the market's view that the announcement about bond reductions would come in September was \"reasonable.\"\n\nDudley said he did not expect much of an impact on financial markets because the action had been well-telegraphed by the Fed, unlike the \"taper tantrum\" incident that occurred in 2013 when bond rates temporarily spiked when markets were caught by surprise by comments from then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that the Fed was contemplating moves to reduce the size of its monthly purchases of bonds.\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet has soared five-fold - to $4.5 trillion - since the summer of 2008, just before the financial crisis erupted. The increase came as a result of purchases the Fed made of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

(Aug. 11) AP\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nWASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve policymakers were worried last month about inflation, but for two opposing reasons.\n\nOne group of Federal Reserve policymakers felt inflation was falling too low and argued for caution in raising interest rates. Others expressed concerns that delaying further rate hikes could push inflation higher into dangerous territory.\n\nThe policy debate was revealed in minutes released Wednesday of the Fed's July 25-26 meeting. Officials eventually made a unanimous decision to keep its key policy rate unchanged.\n\nThe minutes also showed that several officials pushed for a July announcement that the Fed was ready to start reducing its massive bond holdings, a move that would likely mean slightly higher rates on mortgages and some other loans. Policymakers decided in the end to signal that it would come \"relatively soon.\"\n\nFinancial markets expect that announcement at next month's meeting, but analysts do not expect the Fed's next rate hike to come until December at the earliest. The latest reading of traders' expectations shows less than a 50-50 chance of a December hike, according to the CME Group. If inflation does not start moving higher again, they say it is likely the Fed will keep rates unchanged until next year.\n\nAt the July meeting, officials voted to keep the Fed's benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 1% to 1.25%. The Fed had raised rates at its March and June meetings even though inflation this year has slowed and is now further from the Fed's 2% goal than it was at the start of the year. In June, the Fed continued to signal that it expected to raise rates one more time this year.\n\nIn their July discussion, the minutes showed that some officials expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, even though unemployment has continued to decline. It is currently at a 16-year low of 4.3%.\n\nOfficials worried about low inflation said that the Fed should delay any further rate hikes until it had greater assurance that the slowdown stemmed from temporary factors and that prices would climb more quickly in coming months.\n\nBut other officials worried that with the labor market already at full employment, waiting too long to raise rates again ran the risk of overshooting on the 2% inflation target. That would be \"costly to reverse,\" meaning that the Fed would have to raise rates more quickly and higher in the future, actions that could push the economy into a recession.\n\nThe inflation debate explored a number of issues, the minutes showed, including the possibility that long-held views on the relationship between tight labor markets and higher inflation may no longer be valid.\n\nThe Fed's next meeting is Sept. 19-20.\n\nIn an interview Monday with the Associated Press, William Dudley, head of the Fed's New York regional bank, said that the market's view that the announcement about bond reductions would come in September was \"reasonable.\"\n\nDudley said he did not expect much of an impact on financial markets because the action had been well-telegraphed by the Fed, unlike the \"taper tantrum\" incident that occurred in 2013 when bond rates temporarily spiked when markets were caught by surprise by comments from then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that the Fed was contemplating moves to reduce the size of its monthly purchases of bonds.\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet has soared five-fold -- to $4.5 trillion -- since the summer of 2008, just before the financial crisis erupted.

Officials eventually made a unanimous decision to keep its key policy rate unchanged.\n\nThe minutes also showed that several officials pushed for a July announcement that the Fed was ready to start reducing its massive bond holdings, a move that would likely mean slightly higher rates on mortgages and some other loans. Policymakers decided in the end to signal that it would come \"relatively soon.\"\n\nFinancial markets expect that announcement at next month's meeting, but analysts do not expect the Fed's next rate hike to come until December. If inflation does not start moving higher again, they say it is likely the Fed will keep rates unchanged until next year.\n\nAt the July meeting, officials voted to keep the Fed's benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent. The Fed had raised rates at its March and June meetings even though inflation this year has slowed and is now further from the Fed's 2 per cent goal than it was at the start of the year. In June, the Fed continued to signal that it expected to raise rates one more time this year.\n\nIn their July discussion, the minutes showed that some officials expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, even though unemployment has continued to decline. It is currently at a 16-year low of 4.3 per cent.\n\nOfficials worried about low inflation said that the Fed should delay any further rate hikes until it had greater assurance that the slowdown stemmed from temporary factors and that prices would climb more quickly in coming months.\n\nBut other officials worried that with the labour market already at full employment, waiting too long to raise rates again ran the risk of overshooting on the 2 per cent inflation target. That would be \"costly to reverse,\" meaning that the Fed would have to raise rates more quickly and higher in the future, actions that could push the economy into a recession.\n\nThe inflation debate explored a number of issues, the minutes showed, including the possibility that long-held views on the relationship between tight labour markets and higher inflation may no longer be valid.\n\nThe Fed's next meeting is Sept. 19-20.\n\nIn an interview Monday with the Associated Press, William Dudley, head of the Fed's New York regional bank, said that the market's view that the announcement about bond reductions would come in September was \"reasonable.\"\n\nDudley said he did not expect much of an impact on financial markets because the action had been well-telegraphed by the Fed, unlike the \"taper tantrum\" incident that occurred in 2013 when bond rates temporarily spiked when markets were caught by surprise by comments from then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that the Fed was contemplating moves to reduce the size of its monthly purchases of bonds.\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet has soared five-fold -- to $4.5 trillion -- since the summer of 2008, just before the financial crisis erupted. The increase came as a result of purchases the Fed made of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The purchases were designed to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates as a way of giving the economy an extra boost after the Fed had cut its short-term rate to a record low near zero.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 100, "id": 623, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "wgt": 100, "id": 755, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303277", "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304020", "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304202", "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304730", "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "306369", "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312756", "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "314107", "label": {"eng": "Ben Bernanke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "327901", "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_debate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "673274", "label": {"eng": "Policy debate"}}]}

Others expressed concerns that delaying further rate hikes could push inflation higher into dangerous territory. (Pictured, Fed chair Janet Yellen)\n\nThe policy debate was revealed in minutes released Wednesday of the Fed's July 25-26 meeting. Officials eventually made a unanimous decision to keep its key policy rate unchanged.\n\nThe minutes also showed that several officials pushed for a July announcement that the Fed was ready to start reducing its massive bond holdings, a move that would likely mean slightly higher rates on mortgages and some other loans. Policymakers decided in the end to signal that it would come \"relatively soon.''\n\nFinancial markets expect that announcement at next month's meeting, but analysts do not expect the Fed's next rate hike to come until December. If inflation does not start moving higher again, they say it is likely the Fed will keep rates unchanged until next year.\n\nAt the July meeting, officials voted to keep the Fed's benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The Fed had raised rates at its March and June meetings even though inflation this year has slowed and is now further from the Fed's 2 percent goal than it was at the start of the year. In June, the Fed continued to signal that it expected to raise rates one more time this year.\n\nIn their July discussion, the minutes showed that some officials expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, even though unemployment has continued to decline. It is currently at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.\n\nOfficials worried about low inflation said that the Fed should delay any further rate hikes until it had greater assurance that the slowdown stemmed from temporary factors and that prices would climb more quickly in coming months.\n\nBut other officials worried that with the labor market already at full employment, waiting too long to raise rates again ran the risk of overshooting on the 2 percent inflation target. That would be \"costly to reverse,'' meaning that the Fed would have to raise rates more quickly and higher in the future, actions that could push the economy into a recession.\n\nThe inflation debate explored a number of issues, the minutes showed, including the possibility that long-held views on the relationship between tight labor markets and higher inflation may no longer be valid.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "wgt": 100, "id": 364, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 100, "id": 623, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304730", "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312756", "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "327901", "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "338761", "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_debate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "673274", "label": {"eng": "Policy debate"}}]}

With the economy now much healthier, the Fed is ready to begin trimming its bond holdings.\n\nDudley also said that he would favor a third increase this year in the Fed's benchmark short-term rate if the economy remained strong. Many investors expect a modest rate hike in December, to follow the Fed's previous increases in March and June this year.\n\nSpeaking of the Fed's likely September announcement that it will begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, Dudley expressed confidence that investors would react calmly to the prospect of modestly higher rates on some consumer and business loans. He noted that the Fed spelled out to investors months ago the system it plans to use to reduce the portfolio gradually.\n\n\"The plan is out there,\" he said during an interview at the New York Fed. \"It's been generally well-received and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place.\"\n\nAs president of the Fed's New York regional bank, Dudley is an influential voice on interest-rate policy. He is vice chairman of the central bank's policy panel that sets interest rates and is a longtime close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nHis interview with the AP comes at a time when the Fed has essentially met one of its two mandates: To maximize employment. The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and job growth remains consistently solid.\n\nYet the Fed has so far failed to meet its second objective of keeping prices stable. Inflation has stayed chronically below the Fed's 2 percent target rate - a problem because consumers often delay purchases when they think prices will stay the same or even decline. In its latest reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge was just 1.4 percent year over year. Dudley said Monday that he still thinks inflation will rise toward the Fed's target level as the job market strengthens further and sluggish wage growth begins to pick up.\n\nOn other topics, Dudley:\n\n- Suggested that Gary Cohn, who leads President Donald Trump's National Economic Council and is close to Trump, would be a \"reasonable candidate\" to succeed Yellen as Fed chair if Trump chooses not to re-nominate Yellen when her term ends early next year. Dudley, who worked with Cohn as top officials at Goldman Sachs, said Cohn \"knows a lot about financial markets,\" and \"I don't think you have to have a Ph.D. in economics\" to lead the Fed. In a recent interview, Trump said he was considering both Yellen and Cohn for the top Fed job, along with some other candidates he would not name.\n\n- Expressed confidence that the Fed's political independence, long considered essential for it to carry out its functions, would remain respected during a Trump presidency. Trump may have the opportunity to install up to five members of the Fed's seven-member board over the next year, and the president has shown a tendency to expect loyalty from some people he has named to key positions. Trump had offered a harsh judgment of the Fed and of Yellen during the presidential campaign but has since avoided making critical comments. Dudley noted that the Trump administration has so far been \"very hands-off\" toward the Fed, \"very respectful of the monetary policy.\"\n\n- Said that even as stock prices set record highs and other assets surge as well, he isn't concerned that any potentially devastating asset bubbles might be forming, akin to the subprime mortgage bubble that triggered the 2008 crisis. Dudley said asset prices \"are pretty consistent with what we are seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy,\" which he said has been evolving without much volatility.\n\n-Acknowledged that policymakers need to be \"somewhat humble\" about how the forthcoming reduction in the Fed's bond portfolio might affect financial markets and loan rates. Dudley noted that the Fed has never before had to pare a balance sheet that has grown five-fold to $4.5 trillion. But he said officials have learned from the 2013 \"taper tantrum\" that rocked markets after a surprise announcement from the Fed, and has sought to telegraph all its actions well in advance.\n\nThe Fed's announcement that it will start paring its bond portfolio is expected to come after its next policy meeting ends Sept. 20. The meeting after that, in December, is when many Fed watchers expect the next increase in its key short-term rate, which remains in a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.\n\nYellen and other Fed officials have attributed the persistently low inflation rate, which slowed further in recent months, to such transitory events as a sharp drop in cellphone fees.\n\nDudley said that if the economy evolves during the rest of 2017 as he expects, with inflation rebounding, \"I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\"\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

With the economy now much healthier, the Fed is ready to begin selling some of those bonds.\n\nDudley also said that he would favor a third increase this year in the Fed's benchmark short-term rate if the economy remained strong. Many investors expect a modest rate hike in December, to follow the Fed's previous increases in March and June this year.\n\nSpeaking of the Fed's likely September announcement that it will begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, Dudley expressed confidence that investors would react calmly to the prospect of modestly higher rates on some consumer and business loans. He noted that the Fed spelled out to investors months ago the system it plans to use to reduce the portfolio gradually.\n\n\"The plan is out there,\" he said during an interview at the New York Fed. \"It's been generally well-received and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place.\"\n\nAs president of the Fed's New York regional bank, Dudley is an influential voice on interest-rate policy. He is vice chairman of the central bank's policy panel that sets interest rates and is a longtime close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nHis interview with the AP comes at a time when the Fed has essentially met one of its two mandates: To maximize employment. The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and job growth remains consistently solid.\n\nYet the Fed has so far failed to meet its second objective of keeping prices stable. Inflation has stayed chronically below the Fed's 2 percent target rate -- a problem because consumers often delay purchases when they think prices will stay the same or even decline. In its latest reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge was just 1.4 percent year over year. Dudley said Monday that he still thinks inflation will rise toward the Fed's target level as the job market strengthens further and sluggish wage growth begins to pick up.\n\nOn other topics, Dudley:\n\n-- Suggested that Gary Cohn, who leads President Donald Trump's National Economic Council and is close to Trump, would be a \"reasonable candidate\" to succeed Yellen as Fed chair if Trump chooses not to re-nominate Yellen when her term ends early next year. Dudley, who worked with Cohn as top officials at Goldman Sachs, said Cohn \"knows a lot about financial markets,\" and \"I don't think you have to have a Ph.D. in economics\" to lead the Fed. In a recent interview, Trump said he was considering both Yellen and Cohn for the top Fed job, along with some other candidates he would not name.\n\n-- Expressed confidence that the Fed's political independence, long considered essential for it to carry out its functions, would remain respected during a Trump presidency. Trump may have the opportunity to install up to five members of the Fed's seven-member board over the next year, and the president has shown a tendency to expect loyalty from some people he has named to key positions. Trump had offered a harsh judgment of the Fed and of Yellen during the presidential campaign but has since avoided making critical comments. Dudley noted that the Trump administration has so far been \"very hands-off\" toward the Fed, \"very respectful of the monetary policy.\"\n\n-- Said that even as stock prices set record highs and other assets surge as well, he isn't concerned that any potentially devastating asset bubbles might be forming, akin to the subprime mortgage bubble that triggered the 2008 crisis. Dudley said asset prices \"are pretty consistent with what we are seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy,\" which he said has been evolving without much volatility.\n\n-- Acknowledged that policymakers need to be \"somewhat humble\" about how the forthcoming reduction in the Fed's bond portfolio might affect financial markets and loan rates. Dudley noted that the Fed has never before had to pare a balance sheet that has grown five-fold to $4.5 trillion. But he said officials have learned from the 2013 \"taper tantrum\" that rocked markets after a surprise announcement from the Fed, and has sought to telegraph all its actions well in advance.\n\nThe Fed's announcement that it will start paring its bond portfolio is expected to come after its next policy meeting ends Sept. 20. The meeting after that, in December, is when many Fed watchers expect the next increase in its key short-term rate, which remains in a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.\n\nYellen and other Fed officials have attributed the persistently low inflation rate, which slowed further in recent months, to such transitory events as a sharp drop in cellphone fees.\n\nDudley said that if the economy evolves during the rest of 2017 as he expects, with inflation rebounding, \"I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\"", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri":

With the economy now much healthier, the Fed is ready to begin selling some of those bonds.\n\nDudley also said that he would favor a third increase this year in the Fed's benchmark short-term rate if the economy remained strong.

Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, speaks during a panel discussion at The Bank of England in London. In an interview with The Associated Press, Dudley indicated that the Fed will likely make an announcement at its September 2017 meeting that it is ready to start reducing its massive bond portfolio, a move expected to put upward pressure on long-term interest rates including home mortgages. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, Pool, File)\n\nSpeaking of the Fed's likely September announcement that it will begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, Dudley expressed confidence that investors would react calmly to the prospect of modestly higher rates on some consumer and business loans. He noted that the Fed spelled out to investors months ago the system it plans to use to reduce the portfolio gradually.\n\n\"The plan is out there,\" he said during an interview at the New York Fed. \"It's been generally well-received and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place.\"\n\nAs president of the Fed's New York regional bank, Dudley is an influential voice on interest-rate policy. He is vice chairman of the central bank's policy panel that sets interest rates and is a longtime close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nHis interview with the AP comes at a time when the Fed has essentially met one of its two mandates: To maximize employment. The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and job growth remains consistently solid.\n\nYet the Fed has so far failed to meet its second objective of keeping prices stable. Inflation has stayed chronically below the Fed's 2 percent target rate - a problem because consumers often delay purchases when they think prices will stay the same or even decline. In its latest reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge was just 1.4 percent year over year. Dudley said Monday that he still thinks inflation will rise toward the Fed's target level as the job market strengthens further and sluggish wage growth begins to pick up.\n\nOn other topics, Dudley:\n\n- Suggested that Gary Cohn, who leads President Donald Trump's National Economic Council and is close to Trump, would be a \"reasonable candidate\" to succeed Yellen as Fed chair if Trump chooses not to re-nominate Yellen when her term ends early next year. Dudley, who worked with Cohn as top officials at Goldman Sachs, said Cohn \"knows a lot about financial markets,\" and \"I don't think you have to have a Ph.D. in economics\" to lead the Fed. In a recent interview, Trump said he was considering both Yellen and Cohn for the top Fed job, along with some other candidates he would not name.\n\n- Expressed confidence that the Fed's political independence, long considered essential for it to carry out its functions, would remain respected during a Trump presidency. Trump may have the opportunity to install up to five members of the Fed's seven-member board over the next year, and the president has shown a tendency to expect loyalty from some people he has named to key positions. Trump had offered a harsh judgment of the Fed and of Yellen during the presidential campaign but has since avoided making critical comments. Dudley noted that the Trump administration has so far been \"very hands-off\" toward the Fed, \"very respectful of monetary policy.\"\n\n- Said that even as stock prices set record highs and other assets surge as well, he isn't concerned that any potentially devastating asset bubbles might be forming, akin to the subprime mortgage bubble that triggered the 2008 crisis. Dudley said asset prices \"are pretty consistent with what we are seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy,\" which he said has been evolving without much volatility.\n\nThe Fed's announcement that it will start paring its bond portfolio is expected to come after its next policy meeting ends Sept. 20. The meeting after that, in December, is when many Fed watchers expect the next increase in its key short-term rate, which remains in a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.\n\nYellen and other Fed officials have attributed the persistently low inflation rate, which slowed further in recent months, to such transitory events as a sharp drop in cellphone fees.\n\nDudley said that if the economy evolves during the rest of 2017 as he expects, with inflation rebounding, \"I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\"", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri":

With the economy now much healthier, the Fed is ready to begin selling some of those bonds.\n\nDudley also said that he would favor a third increase this year in the Fed's benchmark short-term rate if the economy remained strong. Many investors expect a modest rate hike in December, to follow the Fed's previous increases in March and June this year.\n\nSpeaking of the Fed's likely September announcement that it will begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, Dudley expressed confidence that investors would react calmly to the prospect of modestly higher rates on some consumer and business loans. He noted that the Fed spelled out to investors months ago the system it plans to use to reduce the portfolio gradually.\n\n\"The plan is out there,\" he said during an interview at the New York Fed. \"It's been generally well-received and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place.\"\n\nAs president of the Fed's New York regional bank, Dudley is an influential voice on interest-rate policy. He is vice chairman of the central bank's policy panel that sets interest rates and is a longtime close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nHis interview with the AP comes at a time when the Fed has essentially met one of its two mandates: To maximize employment. The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and job growth remains consistently solid.\n\nYet the Fed has so far failed to meet its second objective of keeping prices stable. Inflation has stayed chronically below the Fed's 2 percent target rate -- a problem because consumers often delay purchases when they think prices will stay the same or even decline. In its latest reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge was just 1.4 percent year over year. Dudley said Monday that he still thinks inflation will rise toward the Fed's target level as the job market strengthens further and sluggish wage growth begins to pick up.\n\nOn other topics, Dudley:\n\n-- Suggested that Gary Cohn, who leads President Donald Trump's National Economic Council and is close to Trump, would be a \"reasonable candidate\" to succeed Yellen as Fed chair if Trump chooses not to re-nominate Yellen when her term ends early next year. Dudley, who worked with Cohn as top officials at Goldman Sachs, said Cohn \"knows a lot about financial markets,\" and \"I don't think you have to have a Ph.D. in economics\" to lead the Fed. In a recent interview, Trump said he was considering both Yellen and Cohn for the top Fed job, along with some other candidates he would not name.\n\n-- Expressed confidence that the Fed's political independence, long considered essential for it to carry out its functions, would remain respected during a Trump presidency. Trump may have the opportunity to install up to five members of the Fed's seven-member board over the next year, and the president has shown a tendency to expect loyalty from some people he has named to key positions. Trump had offered a harsh judgment of the Fed and of Yellen during the presidential campaign but has since avoided making critical comments. Dudley noted that the Trump administration has so far been \"very hands-off\" toward the Fed, \"very respectful of monetary policy.\"\n\n-- Said that even as stock prices set record highs and other assets surge as well, he isn't concerned that any potentially devastating asset bubbles might be forming, akin to the subprime mortgage bubble that triggered the 2008 crisis. Dudley said asset prices \"are pretty consistent with what we are seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy,\" which he said has been evolving without much volatility.\n\nThe Fed's announcement that it will start paring its bond portfolio is expected to come after its next policy meeting ends Sept. 20. The meeting after that, in December, is when many Fed watchers expect the next increase in its key short-term rate, which remains in a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.\n\nYellen and other Fed officials have attributed the persistently low inflation rate, which slowed further in recent months, to such transitory events as a sharp drop in cellphone fees.\n\nDudley said that if the

The rate now is between 1% and 1.25%.\n\nBut Fed officials continue to be worried that inflation remains too low, according to the meeting minutes. For the 12-months ended June 30, the most recent data available, the Fed's preferred inflation measure was 1.4%.\n\nFed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen has attributed the recent slowdown in inflation mostly to temporary factors, such as lower costs for cellphone plans.\n\nMany Fed policymakers at the July meeting agreed, but said inflation \"would likely continue to be held down over the second half of the year by the effects of those factors,\" the minutes said.\n\nGiven the low inflation, some officials said the Fed \"could afford to be patient\" on future interest rate hikes. But some others were worried that without additional hikes, inflation might accelerate above the Fed's target as the jobs market continued to improve.\n\nA reduction in the Fed's assets -- mostly U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities -- is expected to help push up mortgage and other longer-term interest rates.\n\nThe bond purchases caused the amount of assets on the Fed's balance sheet to more than quadruple since 2008. The Fed stopped buying bonds in 2014 but the size of its holdings has remained roughly the same because the money from maturing securities has been reinvested in new ones.\n\nThe Fed is planning to slowly decrease the size of its holdings by allowing some of the proceeds from maturing bonds to be cashed out instead of reinvested.\n\nTwitter: @JimPuzzanghera\n\njim.puzzanghera@latimes.com", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 100, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 265, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events/Business_and_Economy", "wgt": 100, "id": 266, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events/Business and Economy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "wgt": 100, "id": 685, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302736", "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302995", "label": {"eng": "Asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303006", "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303239", "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303277", "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303547", "label": {"eng": "Money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304196", "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304197", "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304202", "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304655", "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304730", "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306369", "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310990", "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314104", "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "315161", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "338761", "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}]}

Others expressed concerns that delaying further rate hikes could push inflation higher into dangerous territory.\n\nThe policy debate was revealed in minutes released Wednesday of the Fed's July 25-26 meeting. Officials eventually made a unanimous decision to keep its key policy rate unchanged.\n\nThe minutes also showed that several officials pushed for a July announcement that the Fed was ready to start reducing its massive bond holdings, a move that would likely mean slightly higher rates on mortgages and some other loans. Policymakers decided in the end to signal that it would come \"relatively soon.\"\n\nFinancial markets expect that announcement at next month's meeting, but analysts do not expect the Fed's next rate hike to come until December at the earliest. The latest reading of traders' expectations shows less than a 50-50 chance of a December hike, according to the CME Group. If inflation does not start moving higher again, they say it is likely the Fed will keep rates unchanged until next year.\n\nAt the July meeting, officials voted to keep the Fed's benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The Fed had raised rates at its March and June meetings even though inflation this year has slowed and is now further from the Fed's 2 percent goal than it was at the start of the year. In June, the Fed continued to signal that it expected to raise rates one more time this year.\n\nIn their July discussion, the minutes showed that some officials expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, even though unemployment has continued to decline. It is currently at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.\n\nOfficials worried about low inflation said that the Fed should delay any further rate hikes until it had greater assurance that the slowdown stemmed from temporary factors and that prices would climb more quickly in coming months.\n\nBut other officials worried that with the labor market already at full employment, waiting too long to raise rates again ran the risk of overshooting on the 2 percent inflation target. That would be \"costly to reverse,\" meaning that the Fed would have to raise rates more quickly and higher in the future, actions that could push the economy into a recession.\n\nThe inflation debate explored a number of issues, the minutes showed, including the possibility that long-held views on the relationship between tight labor markets and higher inflation may no longer be valid.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "wgt": 100, "id": 364, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 100, "id": 623, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "wgt": 100, "id": 1221, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304730", "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312756", "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "316836", "label": {"eng": "CME Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "327901", "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_debate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "673274", "label": {"eng": "Policy debate"}}]}

But they agreed to soon begin the years-long process of drawing down the central bank's holdings, according to minutes of the July 25-26 meeting released Wednesday after the customary three-week lag.\n\nSagging inflation led some officials to suggest holding off on raising rates again for now, arguing the Fed \"could afford to be patient under current circumstances.\"\n\nOthers, however, worried that the strong labor market and high stock prices could produce a spurt of inflation above the central bank's 2% target that could be difficult to control. This group cautioned that waiting too long to raise rates \"could result in an overshooting of the [Fed's] inflation objective that would likely be costly to reverse,\" the minutes said.\n\nThe minutes could raise doubts about the prospects of another increase in the Fed's benchmark interest rate by year's end. The central bank has raised rates twice this year and penciled in a third rate increase in 2017 as well as three in 2018.\n\nFed officials have been publically airing their disagreement over the proper course of interest rates since the meeting.\n\nOn. Aug. 11, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said he wants to see \"more evidence\" of progress towards the inflation goal before he'll support another rate increase, adding that the current 1% to 1.25% range for the Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate was \"appropriate.\" He spoke a day after Chicago Fed President Charles Evans urged officials to \"be very careful in assessing the future [rate] moves.\"\n\nNew York Fed President William Dudley, on the other hand, said in an interview with the Associated Press this week that he \"would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\"\n\nThe split has left markets questioning a third rate increase in 2017. As of Wednesday morning, before the release of the minutes, investors saw a roughly 50% probability the Fed would leave rates unchanged through year's end.\n\nFed Chairwoman Janet Yellen could have a chance to weigh in at the Kansas City Fed's annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., later this month.\n\nFed officials and economists have struggled over the past few years to reconcile booming job growth with weak price pressures. Under standard economic theory, a better labor market would lead to higher wages and consumer prices. That hasn't happened.\n\nSome officials in July said they thought the standard theory \"was not particularly useful,\" while others believed it remained valid. Puzzled policy makers talked through possible explanations for the disconnect, including possible structural changes in the labor market or imprecise data, according to the minutes.\n\nMs. Yellen,in Congressional testimony last month, said she believed inflation would move back to 2% over the next couple of years.\n\nData released since the meeting, however, showed inflation continues to weaken while the labor market continues to strengthen. Prices rose 1.4% in June over the previous year, down from 1.5% in May, according to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Meanwhile, employers added a healthy 209,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3%, matching the lowest level in 16 years.\n\nThe minutes also indicated that officials were confident their plans to slowly reduce their $4.5 trillion portfolio would run smoothly without disrupting markets. Some officials were ready to announce the start of the portfolio runoff in July but \"most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting\" in order to gather more information, the minutes said. Offcicials agreed that they should begin the process \"relatively soon.\"\n\nThe Fed next meets on September 19-20. In recent weeks, some Fed officials have said the September meeting would be an appropriate time to begin shrinking the balance sheet.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Fed launched large-scale asset purchase programs that scooped up Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to lower long-term borrowing costs. Today, with the economy on a firmer footing, officials are ready to start unwinding those programs by letting a preset amount of securities mature every month. Officials haven't said when they'll begin or how much they are likely to shrink their portfolio.\n\nPolicy makers at the July meeting said they expected market reaction to the portfolio reduction process to be muted. Unwinding the asset purchase programs would \"contribute only modestly\" to tighter monetary policy, they said.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs estimate shrinking the balance sheet will raise 10-year Treasury yields by 0.2 percentage point this year, 0.15 percentage point next year and 0.1 percentage point between 2019 and 2012.\n\nYields have been historically low in recent years, hovering below 2.3% for the past two weeks.\n\nThe July minutes also said that some Fed officials see a waning possibility that the Republican-held Congress and the Trump administration will manage to push through their ambitious plans for a tax overhaul and new infrastructure spending.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label":

With the economy now much healthier, the Fed is ready to begin selling some of those bonds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDudley also said that he would favor a third increase this year in the Fed's benchmark short-term rate if the economy remained strong. Many investors expect a modest rate hike in December, to follow the Fed's previous increases in March and June this year.\n\nSpeaking of the Fed's likely September announcement that it will begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, Dudley expressed confidence that investors would react calmly to the prospect of modestly higher rates on some consumer and business loans. He noted that the Fed spelled out to investors months ago the system it plans to use to reduce the portfolio gradually.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day's most important business news, delivered weekdays.

''It's been generally well-received and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place.''\n\nAs president of the Fed's New York regional bank, Dudley is an influential voice on interest rate policy. He is vice chairman of the central bank's policy panel that sets interest rates and is a longtime close ally of Fed chair Janet Yellen.\n\nHis interview with the AP comes at a time when the Fed has essentially met one of its two mandates: To maximize employment. The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and job growth remains consistently solid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the Fed has so far failed to meet its second objective of keeping prices stable. Inflation has stayed chronically below the Fed's 2 percent target rate -- a problem because consumers often delay purchases when they think prices will stay the same or even decline. In its latest reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge was just 1.4 percent year over year. Dudley said Monday that he still thinks inflation will rise toward the Fed's target level as the job market strengthens further and sluggish wage growth begins to pick up.\n\nOn other topics, Dudley:\n\n\u25a0 Suggested that Gary Cohn, who leads President Trump's National Economic Council and is close to Trump, would be a ''reasonable candidate'' to succeed Yellen as Fed chair if Trump chooses not to renominate Yellen when her term ends early next year. In a recent interview, Trump said he was considering both Yellen and Cohn for the top Fed job, along with some other candidates he would not name.\n\n\u25a0 Expressed confidence that the Fed's political independence, long considered essential for it to carry out its functions, would remain respected during a Trump presidency. Trump may have the opportunity to install up to five members of the Fed's seven-member board over the next year. Dudley noted that the Trump administration has so far been ''very hands-off'' toward the Fed, ''very respectful of the monetary policy.''\n\n\u25a0 Said that even as stock prices set record highs and other assets surge as well, he isn't concerned that any potentially devastating asset bubbles might be forming, akin to the subprime mortgage bubble that triggered the 2008 crisis. Dudley said asset prices ''are pretty consistent with what we are seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy,'' which he said has been evolving without much volatility.\n\n\u25a0 Acknowledged that policy makers need to be ''somewhat humble'' about how the forthcoming reduction in the Fed's bond portfolio might affect financial markets and loan rates. Dudley noted that the Fed has never before had to pare a balance sheet that has grown five-fold to $4.5 trillion. But he said officials have learned from the 2013 ''taper tantrum'' that rocked markets after a surprise announcement from the Fed, and has sought to telegraph all its actions well in advance.\n\nThe Fed's announcement that it will start paring its bond portfolio is expected to come after its next policy meeting ends Sept. 20.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 100, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 265, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events/Business_and_Economy", "wgt": 100, "id": 266, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events/Business and Economy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "wgt": 100, "id": 755, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dudley"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dudley"}, "type": "loc", "id": "89649"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302578", "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302591", "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302685", "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302995", "label": {"eng": "Asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303277", "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303385", "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303889", "label": {"eng": "Wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304070", "label": {"eng": "News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304196", "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304202", "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304539", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007\u201308", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304616", "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis of 2007\u201308"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "338761", "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cohn_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "397337", "label": {"eng": "Gary Cohn (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Economic_Council", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "590560", "label": {"eng": "United States National Economic Council"}}]}

It also said it planned to start reducing its asset holdings \"relatively soon.\" The minutes said some Fed officials were ready to announce a starting date for the reductions, but most favored just a little more patience. Analysts expect an announcement after the Fed's next meeting, Sept. 19 and 20.\n\nThe timing of the Fed's next rate move is considerably less certain. The Fed entered the year predicting three rate increases of a quarter-point each; so far it has delivered two, with a third seen possible in December.\n\nBut the weakness of inflation, which the Fed now expects to remain below its target annual pace of 2 percent for the fifth consecutive year, is prompting some Fed officials to hesitate.\n\nMost Fed officials subscribe to a view of inflation in which prices rise more quickly as unemployment declines. The basic idea is that companies must offer higher and higher wages to keep their workers.\n\nNow, the Fed is confronting \"the coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment,\" a phenomenon that inverts the \"stagflation\" experience of the 1970s, when both inflation and unemployment climbed.\n\nThe meeting account said most officials continued to regard low unemployment as the most important factor. They said inflation was rising slowly because of temporary factors, like a decline in cellphone prices. And they remain inclined to raise the Fed's benchmark rate later this year.\n\nBut as low inflation persists, alternative theories have blossomed. Some Fed officials see evidence that the low unemployment rate overstates the health of the job market, and therefore that the Fed should wait to raise interest rates.\n\nLow rates support job growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking.\n\nOthers see evidence that the connection between unemployment and inflation has been overstated.\n\nSome Fed officials have suggested that the public is losing confidence that the Fed will raise inflation back to a 2 percent annual pace, which could make it harder for the Fed to do so, because inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling.\n\nThe account said some voting members of the Fed's policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, wanted reassurance that inflation was rising before voting to raise rates again.\n\nThe slow pace of wage growth is driving a parallel debate. Wages have increased modestly in recent years, and the minutes noted again there was \"little evidence of wage pressures.\"\n\nSome officials see further confirmation that the economy is weak.\n\nOthers, however, see the data as misleading. One possibility, advanced by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is that aggregate wage measures remain low because the baby boomers are retiring. In this view, older, high-wage workers are being replaced by younger workers who make less simply because they are at an earlier stage in their careers. That is holding down measures of average wages, but individual workers may still be seeing healthier wage growth.\n\nAnd there are also those who contend that wage growth is doing about as well as one would expect given the slow growth of productivity.\n\nFed officials continue to retreat from the expectation that the Trump administration will deliver a large dose of fiscal stimulus, whether in tax cuts or increased infrastructure spending. The Fed reported that companies, too, are losing hope.\n\n\"Uncertainty about the course of federal government policy, including in the areas of fiscal policy, trade and health care, was tending to weigh down firms' spending and hiring plans,\" the minutes said.\n\nThe Fed also included in the minutes a warning about the Trump administration's plans to reduce what it regards as overly burdensome financial regulation.\n\n\"It would not be desirable,\" the minutes said, \"for the current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that allowed a re-emergence of the types of risky practices that contributed to the crisis.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 265, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events/Business_and_Economy", "wgt": 100, "id": 266, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events/Business and Economy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303732", "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303889", "label": {"eng": "Wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304014", "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304617", "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "312074", "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314056", "label": {"eng": "Stagflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "320076", "label": {"eng": "Baby boomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "451988", "label": {"eng": "Self-fulfilling prophecy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "516265", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"}}]}

More weakness in inflation could be mean a delay in rate hikes from the Fed. The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year. It's expected to increase interest rates one more time in 2017 and take the US interest rate from 1.25% to 1.50%. The Fed has termed the slowdown in growth and inflation (VTIP) in the first quarter as \"transitory.\" However, the Fed changed its tone in the recent meeting.

I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\"\n\nThe Fed has raised rates twice this year and aims, according to forecasts, to hike once more. However a slide in inflation readings in recent months to 1.5 percent, below a 2-percent Fed target, has raised doubts among investors who give about a 40 percent chance of the Fed following through.\n\nMore certain is the Fed's well-telegraphed plan to announce the start date for beginning to shed some of the bonds in its $4.5-trillion portfolio, most of which it amassed to spur the economy in the wake of the 2007-2009 crisis.\n\n\"I don't think the expectations of market participants are unreasonable,\" Dudley, who has a permanent vote on Fed policy, said when asked whether predictions were accurate for the plan to be announced at a mid-September meeting. He predicted the portfolio would shrink to between $2.5 and $3.5 trillion after five years.\n\nInvestors and economists generally expect the Fed next month to announce that bonds will begin to run off around October 1. That is the month that the Treasury is expected to fully exhaust its remaining borrowing capacity in what is known as the \"debt ceiling.\"\n\nThis does \"not really\" pose difficulties for the Fed because the debt it holds counts against the limit, and it could choose to \"delay the actual start date\" of reducing the portfolio, Dudley said.\n\nElsewhere in Washington, speculation has heated up over who President Donald Trump would pick as Fed chair, with the president himself saying his economic advisor Gary Cohn as well as Yellen, whose term expires in February, are contenders. Fed officials and congressional Democrats have worried that that and other vacancies would leave the door open for Republicans to trim the Fed's historic independence from politics.\n\nAsked about Cohn, Dudley said he is a \"reasonable candidate ... who knows a lot about financial markets.\" Both men are Goldman Sachs alumni: Cohn a president at the Wall Street bank and Dudley a partner.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has been very hands-off in terms of the Fed,\" Dudley added when asked about threats to independence. \"So, I think they've been very respectful of the monetary policy, not to politicize the monetary policy process.\"\n\nSEARCH", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label":

With the economy now much healthier, the Fed is ready to begin trimming its bond holdings.\n\nDudley also said that he would favor a third increase this year in the Fed's benchmark short-term rate if the economy remained strong. Many investors expect a modest rate hike in December, to follow the Fed's previous increases in March and June this year.\n\nSpeaking of the Fed's likely September announcement that it will begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, Dudley expressed confidence that investors would react calmly to the prospect of modestly higher rates on some consumer and business loans.\n\nDudley pointed out that the Fed spelled out to investors months ago the system it plans to use to reduce the portfolio gradually.\n\n\"The plan is out there,\" he said during an interview at the New York Fed. \"It's been generally well-received and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place.\"\n\nAs president of the Fed's New York regional bank, Dudley is an influential voice on interest-rate policy. He is vice chairman of the central bank's policy panel that sets interest rates and is a longtime close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nHis interview with the AP comes at a time when the Fed has essentially met one of its two mandates: To maximize employment. The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and job growth remains consistently solid.\n\nYet the Fed has so far failed to meet its second objective of keeping prices stable. Inflation has stayed chronically below the Fed's 2 percent target rate - a problem because consumers often delay purchases when they think prices will stay the same or even decline.\n\nIn its latest reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge was just 1.4 percent year over year. Dudley said Monday that he still thinks inflation will rise toward the Fed's target level as the job market strengthens further and sluggish wage growth begins to pick up.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

Fed officials and congressional Democrats have worried that that and other vacancies would leave the door open for Republicans to trim the Fed's historic independence from politics.\n\nAsked about Cohn, Dudley said he is a \"reasonable candidate ... who knows a lot about financial markets.\" Both men are Goldman Sachs alumni: Cohn a president at the Wall Street bank and Dudley a partner.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has been very hands-off in terms of the Fed,\" Dudley added when asked about threats to independence. \"So, I think they've been very respectful of the monetary

With the economy now much healthier, the Fed is ready to begin trimming its bond holdings.\n\nDudley also said that he would favor a third increase this year in the Fed's benchmark short-term rate if the economy remained strong. Many investors expect a modest rate hike in December, to follow the Fed's previous increases in March and June this year.\n\nSpeaking of the Fed's likely September announcement that it will begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, Dudley expressed confidence that investors would react calmly to the prospect of modestly higher rates on some consumer and business loans.\n\nDudley pointed out that the Fed spelled out to investors months ago the system it plans to use to reduce the portfolio gradually.\n\n\"The plan is out there,\" he said during an interview at the New York Fed. \"It's been generally well-received and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place.\"\n\nAs president of the Fed's New York regional bank, Dudley is an influential voice on interest-rate policy. He is vice chairman of the central bank's policy panel that sets interest rates and is a longtime close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nHis interview with the AP comes at a time when the Fed has essentially met one of its two mandates: To maximize employment. The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and job growth remains consistently solid.\n\nYet the Fed has so far failed to meet its second objective of keeping prices stable. Inflation has stayed chronically below the Fed's 2 percent target rate - a problem because consumers often delay purchases when they think prices will stay the same or even decline.\n\nIn its latest reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge was just 1.4 percent year over year. Dudley said Monday that he still thinks inflation will rise toward the Fed's target level as the job market strengthens further and sluggish wage growth begins to pick up.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\"\n\nThe Fed has raised rates twice this year and aims, according to forecasts, to hike once more. However a slide in inflation readings in recent months to 1.5 percent, below a 2-percent Fed target, has raised doubts among investors who give about a 40 percent chance of the Fed following through.\n\nMore certain is the Fed's well-telegraphed plan to announce the start date for beginning to shed some of the bonds in its $4.5-trillion portfolio, most of which it amassed to spur the economy in the wake of the 2007-2009 crisis.\n\n\"I don't think the expectations of market participants are unreasonable,\" Dudley, who has a permanent vote on Fed policy, said when asked whether predictions were accurate for the plan to be announced at a mid-September meeting. He predicted the portfolio would shrink to between $2.5 and $3.5 trillion after five years.\n\nInvestors and economists generally expect the Fed next month to announce that bonds will begin to run off around October 1. That is the month that the Treasury is expected to fully exhaust its remaining borrowing capacity in what is known as the \"debt ceiling.\"\n\nThis does \"not really\" pose difficulties for the Fed because the debt it holds counts against the limit, and it could choose to \"delay the actual start date\" of reducing the portfolio, Dudley said.\n\nElsewhere in Washington, speculation has heated up over who President Donald Trump would pick as Fed chair, with the president himself saying his economic advisor Gary Cohn as well as Yellen, whose term expires in February, are contenders. Fed officials and congressional Democrats have worried that that and other vacancies would leave the door open for Republicans to trim the Fed's historic independence from politics.\n\nAsked about Cohn, Dudley said he is a \"reasonable candidate ... who knows a lot about financial markets.\" Both men are Goldman Sachs alumni: Cohn a president at the Wall Street bank and Dudley a partner.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has been very hands-off in terms of the Fed,\" Dudley added when asked about threats to independence. \"So, I think they've been very respectful of the monetary policy, not to politicize the monetary policy process.\"\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Spicer and Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with

A political debate over the debt ceiling is unlikely to have a \"big impact\" on that timetable because the central bank could announce the start of the program but delay the actual date.\n\n\"The plan is out there. It's been, I think, generally well-received, and fully anticipated,\" Dudley said of the outline for drawing down the $4.5 trillion balance sheet. \"In the last FOMC statement, we said that we expected this to happen relatively soon. So, I expect it to happen relatively soon.\"\n\nDudley's comments signal optimism at a time when inflation remains below the Fed's goal even as the labor market continues to expand and the overall economy is chugging along. The New York Fed chief brushed aside recent weak price data as a trend that will probably reverse, suggesting officials might be willing to look past the slowdown even as it becomes more sustained.\n\n\"We do expect as the labor market continues to tighten, to see firmer wage gains and that will ultimately filter into inflation moving up towards our 2 percent objective,\" Dudley said. \"A pretty broad range of evidence that suggests the labor market is quite a bit tighter than it's been in many years. Which is a good thing.\"\n\nFed officials have been projecting one more rate increase in 2017, for a total of three this year, but weak price gains have made markets doubt that outlook. Investors are pricing in just a 29 percent chance of a rate increase by year-end.\n\nThe U.S. has seen an extended run of sub-par inflation prints, the July Consumer Price Index reading showed last week. The Fed's preferred gauge, which comes out with a longer delay, was running at 1.4 percent in June -- well below the Fed's 2 percent goal.\n\nStill, Dudley's comments jibe with the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee's post-meeting statement on July 26, which said price gains were expected to \"stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.\" The Fed is scheduled to release minutes from that meeting this week, an account that could give a more textured glimpse into the inflation discussion.\n\n\"The jury's out of whether there is sort of structural, secular changes in place that are holding inflation lower on a sustained basis,\" Dudley said. \"The next four to six months I think are going to be important to see whether the readings that we've had over the last few months are mainly due to one-off factors, such as the big decline that we've seen in cellphone prices, or whether there's something more fundamental going on.\"\n\nDudley said if secular forces are pushing inflation lower, it's possible that the unemployment rate could fall further before it precipitates higher wages and prices.\n\nThe jobless rate fell to 4.3 percent in July, down from 4.7 percent headed into the year and below policy makers' estimate of the longer-run sustainable rate. The median official expected U.S. joblessness to average 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter and hold around 4.6 percent in the longer term, according to quarterly projections updated in June.\n\nThe New York Fed chief also brushed aside concerns about high asset prices, saying he's \"not particularly concerned,\" primarily because \"asset prices are pretty consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy.\" When asked about his impression of White House economic adviser Gary Cohn as Fed chairman, he said \"I don't want to evaluate the various candidates for the Federal Reserve, except to say that I think Gary is a reasonable candidate.\"\n\nDudley, 64, has been President of the New York Fed since 2009 and was formerly chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Most preferred to defer the decision until a later meeting.\n\nWhile the group was mostly on the same page regarding the Fed's bond holdings, it was split on the timing of future interest rate hikes.\n\nRobust job growth this year has emboldened Chairwoman Janet Yellen and others at the Fed to begin shrinking the large balance sheet they built up through successive rounds of bond purchases, commonly referred to as quantitative easing.\n\nThe Fed has just under $4.5 trillion in bonds, mostly Treasury and mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Before the crisis, the central bank had just less than $900 billion in assets, but it went on several bond-buying spreesto increase the amount of money in private hands and boost economy-wide spending.\n\nIn theory, shrinking the balance sheet would have the opposite effect and would slow spending. From the Fed's perspective, such an anti-stimulus would be desirable because the greater danger to the economy now is too-high inflation, rather than high unemployment. With the nation's unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, officials believe that wages and prices must rise soon, forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy to stave off higher inflation.\n\nAt the same time, though, the Fed is moving tentatively. Yellen and company have said that they will start by shrinking the balance sheet by just $10 billion a month, eventually ramping up to $50 billion. And they don't plan to sell bonds, but rather allow existing bonds to mature without reinvesting the proceeds in new securities.\n\nSeveral Fed members have played down the impact of slowly shrinking the balance sheet. As a group, they had not spelled out before Wednesday just how much they might reduce the central bank's holdings. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley suggested in an interview with the Associated Press this week that he might favor a balance sheet of $2.5 trillion to $3.5 trillion.\n\nThe bigger issue, in the eyes of Fed members, is what the central bank does with its short-term interest rate target. Currently set at 1 percent to 1.25 percent, the target influences rates on financial products throughout the economy, such as business loans, mortgages and credit cards. Higher rates should translate to lower spending and inflation.\n\nBefore Wednesday's meeting, investors saw a roughly fifty-fifty chance that the Fed might raise rates again this year.\n\nSome members of the Fed, however, questioned the premise that falling unemployment will inevitable yield higher inflation. A few suggested that the relationship between unemployment and inflation, known to economists as the Phillips Curve, \"was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation.\"\n\nYet \"most\" participants still believe in the Phillips Curve, the minutes revealed. In their assessment of the economy today, inflation is only running below the Fed's 2 percent target because of one-time factors, such as the steep drop in the price of cell phone service thanks to competition among carriers to offer unlimited data plans. In time, they think, inflation is bound to rise.\n\nAt July's meeting, Fed members also discussed the new post-crisis banking rules, and the efforts by the Trump administration and the congressional GOP to roll some of them back. They unanimously agreed that the new regulations on banks have made the financial system safer, and \"that it would not be desirable for the current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that allowed a reemergence of the types of risky practices that contributed to the crisis.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302748", "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302995", "label": {"eng": "Asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303006", "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303083", "label": {"eng": "Investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303547", "label": {"eng": "Money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304196", "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304197", "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304202", "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304539", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304615", "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304655", "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306369", "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308339", "label": {"eng": "Credit (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314104", "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "338761", "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}]}

Over the second quarter, inflation measures have remained weak or even retreated.\n\nOn one hand, some meeting participants feared that persistently low interest rates could create financial instability and spur risk taking. Others believed the low inflation justified allowing the economy to run hotter before hiking again.\n\nAs a group, Fed members generally believe inflation will remain low through the second half of 2017, with many believing it will stabilize \"over the next couple of years from its current low,\" according to the minutes.\n\n\"Many participants, however, saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below two percent for longer than they currently expected, and several indicated that risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside,\" the minutes said.\n\n- The dollar nosedives -\n\nThose pointing to low inflation said the central bank should \"be patient\" before adopting its next rate hike \"until incoming information confirmed that the recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist.\"\n\nFed members were again concerned by the dizzying heights to which Wall Street has risen since President Trump prevailed in November's presidential elections, suggesting too much easy money had encouraged market speculators.\n\n\"The staff warning about asset prices is hawkish, but the doves carried the day in July,\" Chris Low of FTN Financial said in a client note.\n\nThe minutes also suggested that as soon as its next meeting in September the central bank could announce the start of a process of drawing down its $4.5 trillion asset holdings, ending a stimulus policy put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nSince then, the Fed has used the returns on investments in government bonds to purchase yet more bonds but policymakers decided earlier this year the time was ripe for the policy to come to an end.\n\nFed members generally agreed that, given their belief the US economy would likely continue its economic recovery, \"it was appropriate to signal that implementation of the program likely would begin relatively soon.\"\n\nThe minutes' release coincided with Wednesday's collapse of White House business advisory councils, which were scrapped by President Trump in the wake of several high-profile resignations following his comments on a white supremacist rally in Virginia that turned violent.\n\nThe two events sent the US dollar tumbling on exchange markets, with the Dollar Index losing 0.3 percent over the prior day's close shortly after 1900 GMT.\n\n\"The Fed's growing concern about low inflation suggests officials would proceed cautiously in raising borrowing rates in the months ahead which could potentially scupper plans to hike again before year-end,\" Joe Manimbo of Western Union Business Solutions

The Fed entered the year predicting three rate increases of a quarter-point each; so far it has delivered two, with a third seen possible in December.\n\nBut the weakness of inflation, which the Fed now expects to remain below its target annual pace of 2 percent for the fifth-consecutive year, is prompting some Fed officials to hesitate.\n\nMost Fed officials subscribe to a view of inflation in which prices rise more quickly as unemployment declines. The basic idea is that companies must offer higher and higher wages to keep their workers.\n\nNow, the Fed is confronting \"the coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment,\" a phenomenon that inverts the \"stagflation\" experience of the 1970s, when both inflation and unemployment climbed.\n\nThe meeting account said most officials continued to regard low unemployment as the most important factor. They said inflation was rising slowly because of temporary factors, like a decline in cellphone prices. And they remain inclined to raise the Fed's benchmark rate later this year.\n\nBut as low inflation persists, alternative theories have blossomed. Some Fed officials see evidence that the low unemployment rate overstates the health of the job market, and therefore that the Fed should wait to raise interest rates. Low rates support job growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking.\n\nOthers see evidence that the connection between unemployment and inflation has been overstated.\n\nSome Fed officials have suggested that the public is losing confidence that the Fed will raise inflation back to a 2 percent annual pace, which could make it harder for the Fed to do so, because inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling.\n\nThe account said some voting members of the Fed's policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, wanted reassurance that inflation was rising before voting to raise rates again.\n\nThe slow pace of wage growth is driving a parallel debate. Wages have increased modestly in recent years, and the minutes noted again there was \"little evidence of wage pressures.\"\n\nSome officials see further confirmation that the economy is weak.\n\nOthers, however, see the data as misleading. One possibility, advanced by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is that aggregate wage measures remain low because the baby boomers are retiring. In this view, older, high-wage workers are being replaced by younger workers who make less simply because they are at an earlier stage in their careers. That is holding down measures of average wages, but individual workers may still be seeing healthier wage growth.\n\nAnd there are also those who contend that wage growth is doing about as well as one would expect given the slow growth of productivity.\n\nFed officials continue to retreat from the expectation that the Trump administration will deliver a large dose of fiscal stimulus, whether in tax cuts or increased infrastructure spending. The Fed reported that companies, too, are losing hope.\n\n\"Uncertainty about the course of federal government policy, including in the areas of fiscal policy, trade and health care, was tending to weigh down firms' spending and hiring plans,\" the minutes said.\n\nThe Fed also included in the minutes a warning about the Trump administration's plans to reduce what it regards as overly burdensome financial regulation.\n\n\"It would not be desirable,\" the minutes said, \"for the current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that allowed a re-emergence of the types of risky practices that contributed to the crisis.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100, "id": 63, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "wgt": 100, "id": 364, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303732", "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303889", "label": {"eng": "Wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304014", "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304617", "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "312074", "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314056", "label": {"eng": "Stagflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "320076", "label": {"eng": "Baby boomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "451988", "label": {"eng": "Self-fulfilling prophecy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "516265", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"}}]}

Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, speaks during a panel discussion at The Bank of England in London in March.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said it isn't unreasonable to expect the central bank to announce plans in September to start trimming its balance sheet and said he supports another interest-rate increase this year if the economy evolves as he expects.\n\n\"I would expect -- I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year\" if the economy holds up, Dudley told the Associated Press.\n\nExpectations for a September announcement on when the Fed will begin to wind down its balance sheet weren't \"unreasonable,\" he said. A political debate over the debt ceiling is unlikely to have a \"big impact\" on that timetable because the central bank could announce the start of the program but delay the actual date.\n\n\"The plan is out there. It's been, I think, generally well-received, and fully anticipated,\" Dudley said of the outline for drawing down the $4.5 trillion balance sheet. \"In the last FOMC statement, we said that we expected this to happen relatively soon. So, I expect it to happen relatively soon.\"\n\nDudley's comments signal optimism at a time when inflation remains below the Fed's goal even as the labor market continues to expand and the overall economy is chugging along. The New York Fed chief brushed aside recent weak price data as a trend that will probably reverse, suggesting officials might be willing to look past the slowdown even as it becomes more sustained.\n\n\"QUITE A BIT TIGHTER\"\n\n\"We do expect as the labor market continues to tighten, to see firmer wage gains and that will ultimately filter into inflation moving up towards our 2 percent objective,\" Dudley said. \"A pretty broad range of evidence that suggests the labor market is quite a bit tighter than it's been in many years. Which is a good thing.\"\n\nFed officials have been projecting one more rate increase in 2017, for a total of three this year, but weak price gains have made markets doubt that outlook. Investors are pricing in just a 29 percent chance of a rate increase by year-end.\n\nThe U.S. has seen an extended run of sub-par inflation prints, the July Consumer Price Index reading showed last week. The Fed's preferred gauge, which comes out with a longer delay, was running at 1.4 percent in June -- well below the Fed's 2 percent goal.\n\nStill, Dudley's comments jibe with the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee's post-meeting statement on July 26, which said price gains were expected to \"stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.\" The Fed is scheduled to release minutes from that meeting this week, an account that could give a more textured glimpse into the inflation discussion.\n\n\"The jury's out of whether there is sort of structural, secular changes in place that are holding inflation lower on a sustained basis,\" Dudley said. \"The next four to six months I think are going to be important to see whether the readings that we've had over the last few months are mainly due to one-off factors, such as the big decline that we've seen in cellphone prices, or whether there's something more fundamental going on.\"\n\nWAGES, PRICES\n\nDudley said if secular forces are pushing inflation lower, it's possible that the unemployment rate could fall further before it precipitates higher wages and prices.\n\nThe jobless rate fell to 4.3 percent in July, down from 4.7 percent headed into the year and below policy makers' estimate of the longer-run sustainable rate. The median official expected U.S. joblessness to average 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter and hold around 4.6 percent in the longer term, according to quarterly projections updated in June.\n\nThe New York Fed chief also brushed aside concerns about high asset prices, saying he's \"not particularly concerned,\" primarily because \"asset prices are pretty consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy.\" When asked about his impression of White House economic adviser Gary Cohn as Fed chairman, he said \"I don't want to evaluate the various candidates for the Federal Reserve, except to say that I think Gary is a reasonable candidate.\"\n\nDudley, 64, has been President of the New York Fed since 2009 and was formerly chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

The summary portrays views that inflation ultimately will get to the Fed's 2 percent target but is clearly not there yet.\n\n\"Some participants\" who counseled patience expressed \"concern about the recent decline in inflation\" and said the Fed \"could afford to be patient under current circumstances.\" They \"argued against additional adjustments\" until the Fed was sure that inflation was on track.\n\nOn the other side, more hawkish members \"worried about risks arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further.\" Backing off from a steady diet of rate hikes could cause the Fed to overshoot its employment target and cause financial instability, they said.\n\nHowever, it's been inflation where the Fed has continued to miss its target. Chair Janet Yellen's preferred measure, the core personal consumption expenditures index, most recently showed a 1.5 percent annualized gain. That has raised concerns over why the Fed is hiking when it remains considerably beneath its objectives.\n\nOne area that seemed to draw strong consensus was in the plan to reduce the Fed's $4.5 trillion \"balance sheet\" of bonds it accrued during three rounds of stimulus that began during the financial crisis.\n\nMembers agreed that the process of reducing the balance sheet should begin \"relatively soon,\" with some members arguing for a more concreate date to be set. Fed watchers largely expect the central bank to announce the roll-off to be announced at the September meeting and begin shortly thereafter.\n\nUnder the program, the Fed will set a cap for how much of the proceeds it receives will roll off each month, and then continue to reinvest the rest.\n\nThe disagreement over how quickly to raise rates comes at a critical time for the U.S. economy. Fed officials largely judge the economy strong enough to withstand gradual hikes and the slow-motion balance sheet rolloff, but some economists worry the Fed has waited too long and risks causing a recession.\n\nIn their assessment of the economy, FOMC members gave it largely positive remarks, particularly in the areas of employment and household spending. However, the minutes reflect concern over June's weak retail sales and the continuing lack of significant wage increases.\n\nOfficials also are less optimistic over getting help from fiscal policy. President Donald Trump's hopes for tax reform and infrastructure spending remain in limbo and had formed the basis for hopes that Washington would begin doing its part to accelerate growth.\n\n\"Several participants noted that uncertainty about the course of federal government policy, including in the areas of fiscal policy, trade, and health care, was tending to weigh down firms' spending and hiring plans,\" the minutes stated. \"In addition, a few participants suggested that the likelihood of near-term enactment of a fiscal stimulus program had declined further or that the fiscal stimulus likely would be smaller than they previously expected.\"\n\nThe FOMC meets next in September. Traders in the fed funds futures market assign virtually no chance to a rate hike then and about a 50 percent chance of a move before the end of the year.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 265, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events/Business_and_Economy", "wgt": 100, "id": 266, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events/Business and Economy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "wgt": 100, "id": 1221, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "180884"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303074", "label": {"eng": "Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303732", "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303807", "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303889", "label": {"eng": "Wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304014", "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304020", "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304202", "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007\u201308", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304616", "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis of 2007\u201308"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304655", "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306369", "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307047", "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312074", "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312756", "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "317510", "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "324974", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327901", "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "338761", "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}]}

The central bank has already disclosed that it will begin by dropping as much as $6 billion in government bonds and $4 billion in mortgage-backed securities every month.\n\nAccording to the minutes, participants generally agreed that it was \"appropriate to signal that implementation of the program likely would begin relatively soon, absent significant adverse developments in the economy or in financial markets.\"\n\nThere were some participants who wanted to kick off a balance sheet reduction at the July meeting, though most opted to stay the current course.\n\nOn the issue of rate hikes, Fed members were more divided. Some Fed watchers say the central bank could choose to wait until 2018 before raising interest rates, despite predictions for a December hike. Delaying the move could allow the Fed to further evaluate the pace of inflation, which has trailed the Fed's 2% target.\n\nWhile most members saw the outlook for the U.S. economy and labor market as little changed, others \"expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation.\" Those participants also said the Fed can be patient and wait until it becomes clear that recent low readings on inflation were merely a hiccup.\n\nLow inflation \"causes indigestion for the nation's central bankers,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. \"It stands in the way of their long-term hope to boost interest rates and get on with the business of shrinking the $4 trillion balance sheet. Even so, it appears we'll hear about the planned timing of so-called quantitative tightening at the September FOMC meeting.\"\n\nCharles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, recently indicated that a potential rate hike in December is not set in stone. New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said he would support a December increase to the federal funds rate if economic conditions remain strong.\n\nFed members reiterated their intent to move \"gradually\" as they normalize interest rates.

However, \"many\" saw some \"likelihood that inflation might remain below 2 percent for longer than they currently expected,\" according to minutes from the July 25-26 Federal Open Market Committee meeting released in Washington on Wednesday. \"Several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside,\" the minutes said.\n\nThere was also a group of \"some other\" participants who cautioned that easy financial conditions and tight labor markets could result in an \"overshooting\" of the inflation target that could be costly to reverse. They \"cautioned\" against \"a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation.\"\n\nThe minutes didn't specify when the Fed would begin shrinking its balance sheet this year. \"Although several participants were prepared to announce a starting date for the program at the current meeting, most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting,\" the minutes said. The Fed next meets on Sept. 19-20.\n\nFed's Portfolio\n\nThe Fed's portfolio stands at $4.5 trillion in total assets, the legacy of three rounds of quantitative easing as the central bank added additional stimulus with direct bond purchases once its benchmark lending rate was cut to zero in December 2008.\n\nThe Fed staff pushed up its assessment of financial stability risks to \"elevated\" from \"notable,\" the minutes said. Fed officials discussed stock valuations with \"a couple\" saying they were supported by \"favorable macroeconomic factors.\"\n\nU.S. central bankers in June forecast they would raise the benchmark lending rate a third time this year to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. That step may depend on officials' evolving forecast for inflation to rise back to their 2 percent target.\n\nThe minutes showed some officials questioning an inflation framework that rested on employment and growth rising above long-term sustainable levels.\n\n\"A few participants cited evidence suggesting that this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation,\" the minutes said. \"Most participants thought that the framework remained valid.\"\n\nPrice Goal\n\nThe Fed has missed its price goal for most of the past five years. The consumer price index rose 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending July, while the Fed's preferred measure, which is tied to consumption, rose 1.4 percent in June.\n\nIn June officials lowered their 2017 inflation forecast, and indicated they didn't expect to hit the 2 percent target until 2018.\n\nThe unemployment rate last month matched a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and average hourly earnings rose 2.5 percent for the year, around the average rate during the recovery which began in June 2009.\n\nA broader measure of labor costs which includes benefits, the employment cost index, has also fallen short of the rates of increase seen before the recession.\n\nThe economy continues to expand. Non-farm payrolls rose by 209,000 jobs last month, and gross domestic product expanded 2.6 percent in the second quarter.

However, \"many\" saw some \"likelihood that inflation might remain below 2 percent for longer than they currently expected,\" according to minutes from the July 25-26 Federal Open Market Committee meeting released in Washington on Wednesday.\n\n\"Several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside,\" the minutes said.\n\nThere was also a group of \"some other\" participants who cautioned that easy financial conditions and tight labor markets could result in an \"overshooting\" of the inflation target that could be costly to reverse. They \"cautioned\" against \"a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation.\"\n\nThe minutes didn't specify when the Fed would begin shrinking its balance sheet this year.\n\n\"Although several participants were prepared to announce a starting date for the program at the current meeting, most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting,\" the minutes said. The Fed next meets on Sept. 19-20.\n\nFed's Portfolio\n\nThe Fed's portfolio stands at $4.5 trillion in total assets, the legacy of three rounds of quantitative easing as the central bank added additional stimulus with direct bond purchases once its benchmark lending rate was cut to zero in December 2008.\n\nThe Fed staff pushed up its assessment of financial stability risks to \"elevated\" from \"notable,\" the minutes said. Fed officials discussed stock valuations with \"a couple\" saying they were supported by \"favorable macroeconomic factors.\"\n\nU.S. central bankers in June forecast they would raise the benchmark lending rate a third time this year to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. That step may depend on officials' evolving forecast for inflation to rise back to their 2 percent target.\n\nThe minutes showed some officials questioning an inflation framework that rested on employment and growth rising above long-term sustainable levels.\n\n\"A few participants cited evidence suggesting that this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation,\" the minutes said. \"Most participants thought that the framework remained valid.\"\n\nPrice Goal\n\nThe Fed has missed its price goal for most of the past five years. The consumer price index rose 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending July, while the Fed's preferred measure, which is tied to consumption, rose 1.4 percent in June.\n\nIn June officials lowered their 2017 inflation forecast, and indicated they didn't expect to hit the 2 percent target until 2018.\n\nThe unemployment rate last month matched a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and average hourly earnings rose 2.5 percent for the year, around the average rate during the recovery which began in June 2009.\n\nA broader measure of labor costs which includes benefits, the employment cost index, has also fallen short of the rates of increase seen before the recession.\n\nThe economy continues to expand. Non-farm payrolls rose by 209,000 jobs last month, and gross domestic product expanded 2.6 percent in the second quarter.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 265, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events/Business_and_Economy", "wgt": 100, "id": 266, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events/Business and Economy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "wgt": 100, "id": 364, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302591", "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302995", "label": {"eng": "Asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303343", "label": {"eng": "Interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303732", "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304615", "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304655", "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306369", "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308745", "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310385", "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_sovereign-debt_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "318314", "label": {"eng": "European sovereign-debt crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327901", "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}]}

Sadly, for now, an adherence to a strict Phillips curve framework for the economy and fear of financial instability will prevent the Fed from venturing down this path.\n\nChair Janet Yellen gave a speech last fall detailing a potential agenda for macroeconomic researchers. Included in the speech was the proposition that the Fed should run a \"high-pressure economy\" as a possible avenue to boost employment and productivity growth. Initial media reports speculated that Yellen was laying the groundwork to back down from expected rate hikes. These reports were erroneous, as history has proven. Yellen wanted only to plant the seeds of a research agenda, not change the Fed's policy path.\n\nInstead, the Fed continues to treat productivity growth as an exogenous factor. To be sure, monetary policy has a role to play in a low-productivity world. In a recent speech, Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said:\n\nTransparent and sound monetary policy can boost confidence in the stability of the growth outlook, an outcome that can in turn alleviate precautionary demand for savings and encourage investment, pushing up the equilibrium interest rate.\n\nIn this case, the growth outlook takes the supply side of the economy for granted. Fischer is saying that monetary policy needs to be set to line up demand growth with the economy's potential growth rate and thus avoid either recessions or, in the Fed's way of thinking, above-trend growth that necessitates a recession-inducing policy response. The Fed's Summary of Economic Projections reveals this policy intention, anticipating rate hikes that eventually bring demand growth in line with expected potential growth. In the process, they will help the economy grind out an equilibrium where unemployment is at its natural rate and the inflation rate is at the Fed's 2 percent target.\n\nThe Fed is thus doing its job, according to Fischer. The rest is up to fiscal policy makers:\n\n... Policies to boost productivity growth and the longer-run potential of the economy are more likely to be found in effective fiscal and regulatory measures than in central bank actions.\n\nGiven the state of policy in Washington, good luck with that.\n\nUnfortunately, the Fed's approach does not appear to even be pushing up the medium-term equilibrium interest rate. The stickiness of long-term U.S. Treasury yields of around 2 percent indicates that the real medium-term equilibrium rate continues to hover near 0 percent, thereby leaving the Fed's terminal rate projections likely too high. Fed Governor Lael Brainard appears to be moving to the same view.\n\nBut maybe the Fed can switch gears and run that \"high-pressure economy\" Yellen discussed last year and see if looser monetary policy can boost productivity growth. The persistently weak inflationary environment offers the perfect opportunity for such an experiment.\n\nLow inflation already vexes the Fed. Core inflation tumbled early in the year and remains well below the Fed's target. This alone gives the Fed reason to allow a slower path on rate hikes in an experimental effort to boost productivity growth. Moreover, the Fed's supposedly asymmetric inflation target provides even more reason to do so. They should be willing to tolerate persistently above-target inflation as they have below-target inflation. At this point, they have plenty of leeway for an overshoot of inflation.\n\nIn addition, if we have learned anything in the past several years, it is that inflation expectations, both survey and market, are very sticky.\n\nThis helps explain low inflation to date and stands in contrast with Fed fears that inflation expectations are very tenuous, particular to the upside, and would quickly become unanchored if inflation exceeds 2 percent. If inflation expectations are quite entrenched, as it appears, the Fed can run a hot economy without fear that the only way to pull it back is via a sharp rise in interest rates. Sticky inflation expectations mean the Fed can tamper down an unwanted inflation with a return to moderate rate hikes.\n\nAlthough the time might be ripe for a change, I suspect the Fed will hesitate to let the economy run hot in an experiment to boost productivity. Yellen's most recent post-Federal Open Market Committee meeting news conference and congressional testimony indicate continued faith in the Phillips curve framework. In this view, low unemployment rates maintain upward pressure on the inflation forecast, and that forecast remains sufficient to justify continued rate hikes until reaching the equilibrium interest rate. Moreover, the Fed is already concerned that low equilibrium interest rates add to financial instability. They will not want to compound that problem by holding policy rates even lower as well to pursue a policy experiment.\n\nIf this is how events unfold, expect the Fed to keep up the pressure on rate hikes in the short term, but be wary about their longer-term forecasts. I have seen little that makes me believe they can push rates as high as they think they can. At this point, an effort to do so looks likely to be recessionary.\n\nBloomberg Prophets Professionals offering actionable insights on markets, the economy and monetary policy.

Bloomberg's Christopher Condon reports on 'Bloomberg Markets.' (Source: Bloomberg)\n\nFederal Reserve officials engaged in a detailed debate about inflation while keeping the door open for a September announcement on the timing of balance-sheet reductions, according to minutes from their policy meeting in July.\n\nThe minutes showed a majority of Federal Open Market Committee participants sticking with a forecast that inflation would gradually rise to their 2 percent target over the medium term. However, \"many\" saw some \"likelihood that inflation might remain below 2 percent for longer than they currently expected,\" according to minutes from the July 25-26 Federal Open Market Committee meeting released in Washington on Wednesday. \"Several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside,\" the minutes said.\n\nThere was also a group of \"some other\" participants who cautioned that easy financial conditions and tight labor markets could result in an \"overshooting\" of the inflation target that could be costly to reverse. They \"cautioned\" against \"a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation.\"\n\nThe minutes didn't specify when the Fed would begin shrinking its balance sheet this year. \"Although several participants were prepared to announce a starting date for the program at the current meeting, most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting,\" the minutes said. The Fed next meets on Sept. 19-20.\n\nThe Fed's portfolio stands at $4.5 trillion in total assets, the legacy of three rounds of quantitative easing as the central bank added additional stimulus with direct bond purchases once its benchmark lending rate was cut to zero in December 2008.\n\nThe Fed staff pushed up its assessment of financial stability risks to \"elevated\" from \"notable,\" the minutes said. Fed officials discussed stock valuations with \"a couple\" saying they were supported by \"favorable macroeconomic factors.\"\n\nU.S. central bankers in June forecast they would raise the benchmark lending rate a third time this year to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. That step may depend on officials' evolving forecast for inflation to rise back to their 2 percent target.\n\nThe minutes showed some officials questioning an inflation framework that rested on employment and growth rising above long-term sustainable levels.\n\n\"A few participants cited evidence suggesting that this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation,\" the minutes said. \"Most participants thought that the framework remained valid.\"\n\nThe Fed has missed its price goal for most of the past five years. The consumer price index rose 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending July, while the Fed's preferred measure, which is tied to consumption, rose 1.4 percent in June.\n\nIn June officials lowered their 2017 inflation forecast, and indicated they didn't expect to hit the 2 percent target until 2018.\n\nThe unemployment rate last month matched a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, and average hourly earnings rose 2.5 percent for the year, around the average rate during the recovery which began in June 2009.\n\nA broader measure of labor costs which includes benefits, the employment cost index, has also fallen short of the rates of increase seen before the recession.\n\nThe economy continues to expand.

Officials eventually made a unanimous decision to keep its key policy rate unchanged. Questioning the Fed's inflation framework is dovish. The latest reading of traders' expectations shows less than a 50-50 chance of a December hike, according to the CME Group.\n\nThe minutes said \"some participants... argued against additional adjustments\" until the Fed was sure that inflation was on track to meet its 2% target.

The bank had signaled it would raise its benchmark fed-funds rate one more time this year, but the surprising slowdown in inflation has forced officials to reconsider.\n\nMost participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\n\"The Fed's growing concern about low inflation suggests officials would proceed cautiously in raising borrowing rates in the months ahead which could potentially scupper plans to hike again before year-end\", Joe Manimbo of Western Union Business Solutions said in a research note.\n\nIn their July discussion, the minutes showed that some officials expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation, even though unemployment has continued to decline. On the other, more hawkish members \"worried about risks arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further\".\n\n\"Many participants, however, saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below two percent for longer than they now expected, and several indicated that risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside\", the minutes said.\n\nThe Fed bought huge amounts of bonds to support the financial markets during the 2008 crisis, which had a similar effect as rate cuts and has been working for months on a plan to gradually reduce investment holdings without roiling markets.

Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Barack Obama from 2009 through 2010.\n\nWith Janet Yellen's term ending in February, President Trump will have to nominate, and the Senate confirm, a new Fed chair in coming months. There will be much discussion of the merits and implications of various candidates for the job. But it will be important for the president and senators to begin by considering the challenges the next chair will face.\n\nWhile I would have preferred slower increases in interest rates at key junctures, and believe that the Fed has consistently over-assessed future inflation, growth and monetary tightening, and is too serene about the current robustness of the financial system, the Fed has done very well overall in recent years. We have not enjoyed so favorable a combination of low unemployment and inflation in decades. Markets have been remarkably stable -- perhaps even too stable -- for years. And the Fed, by the standards of other Washington institutions and central banks around the world, is highly respected. This all is both a tribute to its leadership and a reflection of fortunate circumstance.\n\nI suspect the Fed's job will become much more difficult over the next few years, however. Economics, finance and politics are all likely to throw up new challenges demanding creative and unorthodox responses.\n\nIf history is any guide, it is more likely than not that the economy will go into recession during the next Fed chair's four-year term. Recovery is now in its ninth year, with relatively slow underlying growth (for both demographic and technological reasons), low unemployment and asset prices that are high by many measures. Even without these factors, there is a 20 percent or so chance that if the economy is not in recession at any given time, it will go into recession within a year. The odds that the next Fed chair will have to address a recession are probably about two-thirds.\n\nHistorically, the Fed has responded to recessions by cutting interest rates substantially, with the benchmark Fed funds rate falling by 400 basis points or more during downturns over the past two generations. This time around, it is unlikely that there will be room for this kind of rate cutting. To influence longer-term rates, the Fed will have to improvise through a combination of rhetoric and direct market intervention. This will not be easy given that 10-year Treasurys, whose yield would decline precipitously in response to a recession and any move to cut fed funds, currently yield below 2.20 percent.\n\nIn consequence -- and to an extent that is underappreciated -- the economy is likely quite brittle within the current inflation-targeting framework. Responsible new leadership at the Fed will have to give serious thought to shifting this framework, perhaps by putting more emphasis on nominal gross domestic product growth, focusing more on price level than inflation (so periods of low inflation are followed by periods of high inflation) or raising the inflation target. None of these steps will be easy given current circumstances. And once a recession comes, it will likely be too late.\n\nThere has not been a major bout of financial instability or a foreign financial crisis in the past four years. This good luck is unlikely to continue. There are real risks emanating from China, from signs of overvaluation in parts of U.S. equity markets and from buildups in leverage, as well as from a highly disordered geopolitical situation in which U.S. credibility has fallen sharply. After the latest round of stress tests, the Fed asserted that even if the stock market lost half its value, the unemployment rate reached 10 percent and real estate prices fell by as much as they did in the last crisis, all the big institutions would be fine at current capital levels. Market evidence suggests otherwise -- based on past patterns, their equity values would collapse.\n\nThe challenge with respect to crisis risk will be maintaining the crucial components of Dodd-Frank financial regulation, such as higher capital levels; recognizing serious problems and forcing fortification of capital positions much more quickly than was done in 2008; and, should a crisis come, finding ways in a difficult legal and political environment to avoid the kind of unraveling that followed Lehman Brothers' failure.\n\nPerhaps the most profound challenges ahead will be political. There must be more risk now of political interference with the Fed than at any time since the Nixon presidency. In dealing with international matters, the Fed is partnered with an understaffed and amateurish Treasury and a president who is busily dissipating U.S. credibility. Most fundamentally, the temper of the times has turned against technical expertise in favor of populist passion -- and the Fed is the quintessential enduring apolitical institution.\n\nWe all have a great stake in the president making and the Senate confirming the right choice.\n\nRead more here:\n\nLawrence H.

There is much discussion of the merits and implications of possible candidates for the job. For Donald Trump and the Senate it will be important to begin by considering the challenges that will face Ms Yellen's \u00adsuccessor.\n\nI would have preferred a slower pace in raising rates at a number of junctures. I also think that in its statements the Fed has consistently over-assessed future inflation, growth and monetary tightening at some cost to its credibility. Overall though, it has done very well in recent years. We have not enjoyed so favourable a combination of unemployment and inflation in decades. Markets and finance have been remarkably stable, perhaps too much so, for years now. And by the standards of other institutions in Washington and central banks the Fed is highly respected. This is all a tribute to its leadership but also to fortunate \u00adcircumstances.\n\nI suspect the Fed's job will be much more difficult over the next few years. Economics, finance and politics will all throw up new challenges that will probably demand creative and unorthodox responses.\n\nIf history is any guide, it is more likely than not that the economy will go into recession during the next Fed chair's four-year term. Recovery is now in its ninth year with relatively slow underlying growth for demographic and technological reasons, very low unemployment and high asset prices. Even without these factors, experience teaches that recessions are almost never forecast or even rapidly recognised by the Fed or the professional consensus forecast, but there is at least a 20 per cent or so chance that if the economy is not in recession, it will be so within a year. So the likelihood that the next Fed chair will have to address a recession is probably about two-thirds.\n\nHistorically, the Fed has responded to recession by cutting rates substantially, with the benchmark funds rate falling by 400 basis points or more in the context of downturns over the past two generations. However, it is very unlikely that there will be room for this kind of rate cutting when the next recession comes given market forecasts. So the central bank will have to improvise with a combination of rhetoric and direct market intervention to influence longer-term rates. That will be tricky given that 10-year Treasuries currently yield below 2.20 per cent and this would decline precipitously with a recession and any move to cut Fed funds.\n\nAs a result, the economy is probably quite brittle within the current inflation targeting framework. This is under-appreciated. Responsible new leadership at the Fed will have to give serious thought to shifting the monetary policy framework, perhaps by putting more emphasis on nominal gross domestic product growth, focusing on the price level rather than inflation (so periods of low inflation are followed by periods of high inflation) or raising the inflation target. None of these steps would be easy in current circumstances, but once recession has come effectiveness will diminish.\n\nThere has not been a major bout of financial instability or a foreign financial crisis in the past four years. Such good fortune is unlikely to continue. There are real risks -- from China to signs of overvaluation in parts of US equity markets, from build-ups in leverage after a long period of low rates and tranquil markets to a highly disordered geopolitical situation in which US credibility has fallen off sharply.\n\nIn reporting on the last round of bank stress tests the Fed has asserted that even if the stock market loses half its value, the unemployment rate reaches 10 per cent and house and real estate prices fall only as much as they did in the last crisis, the big institutions will all be fine without capital increases. Market evidence suggests otherwise, based on past patterns their equity values would collapse.\n\nThe challenge with respect to financial crisis risk will be maintaining the crucial components of Dodd-Frank regulation, such as the requirement to hold higher capital, as well as recognising incipient problems much more quickly than in 2008, when even after Bear Stearns shaky institutions were permitted to make huge dividend payments. If crisis comes the Fed must find ways in a difficult legal and political environment to avoid the kind of unravelling that followed Lehman's failure.\n\nPerhaps the most profound challenges ahead will be political. There must be more risk now of presidential interference with the Fed than at any time since Richard Nixon. In dealing with international matters, the Fed is partnered with an understaffed and amateurish Treasury and a president who is dissipating US credibility. Most fundamentally, the temper of the times has turned against technical expertise in favour of populist passion and the Fed is the quintessential enduring apolitical institution.\n\nWe all have a great stake in the president making and the Senate confirming the right choice.", "date": "2017-08-13", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label":

General price levels are not, however, actually rising at any meaningful rate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics just reported that the U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 1.7 percent from last July. Pretty boring and uneventful. So, why the increased attention? It's mostly due to the uniquely American monetary policy objective. While most central banks around the world are tasked with conducting monetary policy to maintain price stability, the U.S. Federal Reserve has a \"dual mandate\" of pursuing price stability as well as full employment.\n\nThe record levels of unemployment stemming from the previous decade's Great Recession rightly demanded a great degree of focus from Federal Reserve policymakers for many years. But now, thanks to consistent U.S. job growth, the BLS' unemployment rate continues to grind lower, at 4.3 percent in July. A reasonable case can be made that the economy has essentially been at the theoretical construct of full employment for many months now.\n\nWith that part of the dual mandate essentially satisfied at the moment, markets are left to watch inflation as they work to assess the future path of Fed policy. Our macroeconomics textbooks tell us that an economy at full employment should see rising inflation as employers drive wages higher while competing for an increasingly scarce pool of labor. This dynamic has yet to manifest itself in the real economy. Fed officials are divided on how and when inflation might rise above their targeted level of 2 percent. Many Fed members feel that rates should be increased proactively because price increases are almost inevitable at this stage in the economic cycle. More dovish members like Neel Kashkari, Minneapolis Fed president, would prefer a pause in interest rate hikes until evidence of wage inflation materializes. Bloomberg recently quoted Kashkari comparing fears of future inflation to that of a ghost story.\n\n\"I call this a ghost story, meaning, I cannot prove to you that there's not a ghost underneath this table. I cannot prove it definitively. There may be. But there is no evidence that there is a ghost under this table.\"\n\nWe could spill a lot of ink dissecting why inflation has yet to really materialize, and might do so in future writings, but for now suffice it to say that Kashkari's desire for evidence seems rational. We'll keep our focus on how the Fed is likely to act going forward and how its actions might affect financial markets.\n\nIf inflation remains stuck below 2 percent, Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are likely to undershoot their own most recent projections for four additional 0.25-percent rate hikes before the end of next year. Barring a shift in inflation or growth expectations, if Yellen and company raise rates by another full percentage point over that period, it is entirely possible that short-term yields could then exceed the market rates of longer-term bonds. This is known as an \"inversion\" of the yield curve, which is one of the surest signals of an impending economic recession.\n\nIt would be very surprising to see the current Fed take such an aggressively hawkish stance, but inflation and policymakers' points of view certainly bear close watching going forward.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100,

But for a clearer example of sabotage -- albeit without much in the way of a conspiracy -- Trump would do well to cast his gaze at the Federal Reserve, which, dating back to before his inauguration, has been waging war on an inflationary menace that appears not to exist.\n\nTrump's economy is caught in the crossfire, and growing slower because of it.\n\nWith the unemployment rate now low by historical standards, the Fed is steadily raising interest rates -- hiking at the beginning of the year and then again at its June meeting.\n\nMore from Vox:\n\nCharlottesville protests: a quick guide to the violent clashes this weekend\n\nDonald Trump refuses to name the problem of white supremacist violence\n\nWe need to stop acting like Trump isn't pandering to white supremacists\n\nYet the inflation numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday show that over the past year, the Consumer Price Index has risen by just 1.7 percent. The so-called \"core\" CPI that many observers believe is more predictive of future inflation conveniently also increased by just 1.7 percent. The Fed, allegedly, is targeting an inflation rate of 2 percent. As you probably know, 2 percent is higher than 1.7 percent. As you may not know, the Fed's inflation index of choice -- the Personal Consumption Expenditure Deflator -- normally rises about 0.5 percentage points faster than CPI over the course of the year.\n\nSo inflation isn't just below the Fed's danger zone, it's well below it. Yet the central bank is working to slow the economy. And Trump's ideological field of vision has been so narrowed by the conservative movement that he doesn't even seem to see that an alternative course of action is possible.\n\nAfter being excessively critical of US economic performance during President Obama's second term, Trump has flipped recently to being excessively sanguine about job creation on his watch. He brags that the economy has added a million jobs during his first half-year in office, which is true, but it's a slower pace of job creation than we enjoyed in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, or 2012.\n\nThe slowdown -- to be clear -- is not Trump's fault. It's the Fed's.\n\nAfter years of holding short-term interest rates at essentially zero, the Fed raised rates in December 2015 and then again in December 2016. And since the economy keeps growing, the Fed keeps raising rates -- doing so twice so far this year and clearly signaling a desire to keep hiking as long as the economy keeps adding jobs.\n\nBut why? Low interest rates aren't a panacea for all economic problems. But in general, if companies, homebuyers, and government agencies can borrow money cheaply, that's a nice state of affairs. It means it's affordable for firms, individuals, and governments to make durable investments in business equipment, buildings, and infrastructure that add to long-term prosperity while creating short-term jobs. The reason the Fed can't always keep printing money to keep rates low is that inflation might get out of control. But inflation is not currently out of control.\n\nIndeed, it's not even close to being out of control. A calm, measured approach might be to just leave rates where they are unless and until inflation gets above the Fed's target. If and when that happens, then rates can go up. That might mean a year or so of somewhat above-target inflation, but we've lived through years of below-target inflation, so a small error in the other direction seems like a small price to pay for a chance at widespread job creation.\n\nThe current Fed chair, Janet Yellen, was put in office by Barack Obama, and so were most of her colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. So one might think they really are trying to sabotage Trump.\n\nOn the other hand, easier money in 2016 would have given Hillary Clinton a boost in the election and possibly kept Trump out of office in the first place.\n\nIt seems much more likely that Yellen and company are simply making a genuine ideological error. But what's fascinating is that Trump doesn't see it that way. Conservatives spent most of the Obama years castigating Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, for excessively inflationary monetary policy. The fact that inflation kept not showing up didn't deter them.\n\nOddly, Trump seems totally unaware that a more growth-oriented Federal Reserve is even an option.\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump contemplates two possibilities for when Yellen's term expands. One is keeping her in office, because \"I'd like to see rates stay low\" and \"she's historically been a low-interest-rate person.\" He also considers elevating his National Economic Council Chair Gary Cohn, whom he says he has \"great respect\" for and thinks is doing \"a very good job\" in his current role, but under whose watch he believes \"interest rates will be moving up\" at a somewhat faster pace.\n\nWhat he really needs are more people like Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari, who warns that the Fed is currently fighting inflation based on a \"ghost story.\" Kashkari is a Republican, but he's a very lonely voice in conservative economic policy circles today. Most of the people making the case for a more robust push for growth are on the left -- often the far left, like the Roosevelt Institute's J.W. Mason. But Trump has the correct instinct here, just an excessively narrow view of the possibilities where he can't think of anyone more inclined to favor low rates than Yellen. And as long as that keeps up, Trumponomics is going to keep underperforming.\n\nCommentary by Matt Yglesias, a writer at Vox.

But money market pricing suggests investors now see less than a 50 percent chance of a hike by December.\n\n\"Fed communications are cementing expectations of a very gradual approach to monetary tightening,\" Mizuho's head of euro rates strategy Peter Chatwell said.\n\nSigns of the central bank's caution came as President Donald Trump dissolved two business advisory group, sowing further doubts over his ability to deliver growth-boosting spending plans he promised when elected.\n\nThe Fed is not the only central bank wary of weak inflation.\n\nReuters reported on Wednesday that European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will not deliver a new policy message at next week's Jackson Hole conference, tempering expectations for the bank to start charting its course out of stimulus.\n\nU.S. 10-year yields, which had climbed to one-week peaks earlier on Wednesday, fell after the minutes and eventually closed down 4 basis points on the day at around 2.23 percent .\n\nWhen European markets opened on Thursday, benchmark German equivalents fell as much as 2 basis points to 0.42 percent , moving away from Wednesday's high of 0.47 percent. Most other euro zone yields fell 1 bps.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester staked out the hawkish argument for carrying on with U.S. interest rate hikes even while weak inflation has split opinions among her colleagues.\n\nShe said while some price readings have fallen this year, expectations are more stable, and that policy must anticipate changes in the data and not react to temporary aberrations.\n\nSan Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams, a non-voter, said the Fed is roughly at the mid-point on its current path to normalize interest rates. The Fed has raised key overnight borrowing costs four times since December 2015.\n\nThe ECB is set to publish minutes of its last meeting later on Thursday, but analysts are not expecting any market-moving revelations.\n\n\"Those looking for clues ... on either the ECB's strategy for tapering purchases ... or when it is likely to make an announcement on its plans are likely to be disappointed,\" RBC's global macro strategist Peter Schaffrik said.\n\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see

the Fed's large portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities should begin \"relative soon\" while others wanted to wait until the upcoming policy meeting.\n\n\"Participants generally agreed that, in light of their current assessment of economic conditions and the outlook, it was appropriate to signal that implementation of the program likely would begin relatively soon,\" the minutes said\n\nRiskier assets ticked lower while gold added to gains as market participants viewed the minutes as dovish, after Fed members appeared less willing to view the slowdown in inflation as

Good. There are very legitimate doubts that traditional models explain what's happening or, rather, what's not happening.\n\nMinutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting show a growing debate about inflation and why it's retreating, instead of advancing, in the face of 4.3 percent unemployment. The central bank is puzzled that prices have been soft for several months.\n\nIn the absence of any real inflation pressure, the Fed might be reasonably expected to take a break from raising rates while it got a handle on what's happening. By acting in March and June and hinting that September will be about balance sheet reduction, the Fed gave itself some wiggle room.\n\nPolicy makers basically have until December to either see inflation head back toward their 2 percent target or figure out how to respond if it doesn't behave. There's a meeting scheduled for late October, but the Fed's historical aversion to moving in the absence of new forecasts and a press conference effectively rules out a surprise then.\n\nDelaying until December gives officials at least four more months of inflation data. Most still see it returning to its target, in keeping with traditional economic models. And to be fair, as I have written, this isn't exclusively an American phenomenon. Inflation is weak in Europe and Japan despite a pronounced pickup in growth. (It's above target in the U.K.; Brexit complicates that particular picture.)\n\nBut the U.S. is still the world's largest economy, and the Fed is still the world's de facto central bank. The country's financial markets dwarf others despite frequent predictions of decline. How this inflation mystery ends will matter greatly.\n\nWhat if the book doesn't have an end? The minutes show some self-doubt starting to creep in alongside the confidence of the majority:\n\nMost participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Many participants, however, saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below 2 percent for longer than they currently expected, and several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside.\n\nThe account of the July conclave even suggested some heretical questioning of the link between very low unemployment and wages and inflation. The majority are still wedded to the traditional models.\n\nUntil we start to see a convincing swing back to the Fed's target of 2 percent, we will probably see more of this public questioning of assumptions.\n\nSomething less contentious was skepticism about the prospects for large-scale fiscal stimulus, the domain of Congress and the White House. A few participants at the Fed meeting doubted it would happen and, if it did, they suspected the boost would be less than might have once been anticipated. That observation went unchallenged.\n\nStay tuned for the last day of August. That's when the Commerce Department publishes closely watched inflation figures. Enjoy the debate.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 265, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events/Business_and_Economy", "wgt": 100, "id": 266, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events/Business and Economy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "wgt": 100, "id": 364, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 658, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 100, "id": 659, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303051", "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304059", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304617", "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304655", "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304730", "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306369", "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312766", "label": {"eng": "Economic model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1268836", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}}]}

I've heard some intel from people who are plugged in, but it's interesting to see others come to the same view using Occam's Razor-type processes.\n\nBut there is always the possibility that the Fed believes its own PR, and has gotten anchored in the New Normal, and so thinks a little better than the (very crappy) New Normal amounts to too much groaf. Or perhaps they've taken notice of the asset bubbles and decided they need to take some air out of them, even if it might not be so hot for the real economy.\n\nBy Barkley Rosser. Originally published at EconoSpeak\n\nI have a theory that at least some people at the Fed are supporting interest rate increases not because they are worried about incipient inflation that must be nipped in the bud in advance under a regime of inflation targeting, but because they are looking over the horizon and worrying about a possible recession in the not-too-distant future, and they want to be able to have interest rates high enough that they can then engage in lowering them as a stimulative policy tool under the circumstances. If they are too low, then extraordinary measures will need to be used, and some of those measures may not be available in the future.\n\nThis theory is based on nothing solid at all, nothing. I think that those who may be thinking this (and my likely candidate(s) would be people at the very top) are constrained in speaking openly due both to the current institutional arrangement of consensus decisionmaking within an established inflation targeting system with a 2% inflation target, not to mention pressure not to talk about possible future dangers. The current line is that the economy is doing well, and certainly it is on the standard measures of unemployment and inflation, even if the former could be better and wages could be rising more rapidly. Indeed, it is this good performance that is supposedly underlying the moves to raise interest rates and possibly \"normalize\" the balance sheet (which I doubt there will be too much action on). But my theory is that for some of them it is a matter of trying to \"normalize\" on interest rates as well while the possibility of normalizing is possible, while the economy is doing fairly well and one can raise them without obviously slowing things down noticeably, so that indeed there will be the ability to lower them again in the future when necessary.\n\nHe did not put this theory forward, but it was reading the recent column by Larry Summers that appeared in the Washington Post on Monday was been linked to by Mark Thoma today (unable to make that link, sorry) and also can be gotten to at larrysummers.com/2017/08/14/why-the-federal-reserves-job-will-get-harder. He is focused on the upcoming ending of the term of his rival as Chair of the Fed, Janet Yellen, and is worried about who Trump will pick and what will happen. While stating that he would have \"preferred a slower pace of interest rate adjustment,\" he bottom lines that \"Overall it has done well in recent years\" (even though he did not get picked to be Chair).\n\nWhile he thinks the economy is currently doing pretty well, looking forward he worries tha it is \"brittle\" with numerous dangers, and opines that there is a two thirds chance of a recession during the next Fed Chair's term. He then notes how the still low interest rates will make it hard to use the interest rate tool to stimulate the economy, making it difficult for the Fed to do much. He does not make the leap I did to the possibility that this fact may be on the minds of at least some people at the Fed, although they really cannot openly say it.\n\nI agree with his concerns about what is coming due to the political situation, with \"major risk now of presidential interference\" in the Fed, and he makes disparaging remarks about the president quite reasonably so. He also notes that the \"temper of the times has turned against technical expertise in favor of populist passion.\" There is reason to be concerned about what he will do.\n\nBut in the meantime some people at the Fed may be doing their best to make it possible for the Fed to do something in the future when the need will surely arise.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Logic_and_Foundations", "wgt": 100, "id": 191, "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Logic and Foundations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology", "wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Furniture", "wgt": 100, "id": 585, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Furniture"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science", "wgt": 100, "id": 1351, "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Alternative", "wgt": 100, "id": 1462, "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Alternative"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Physicists", "wgt": 100, "id": 1539, "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Physicists"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Quantum_Mechanics", "wgt": 100, "id": 1542, "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Quantum Mechanics"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304020", "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304270", "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306009", "label": {"eng": "Talk radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306369", "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "306679", "label": {"eng": "Risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "327901", "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "338741", "label": {"eng": "Chairman of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "338761", "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "364860", "label": {"eng": "Economic bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "372171", "label": {"eng": "Occam's razor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "399572", "label": {"eng": "Synchronicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "414543", "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Summers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Thoma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "710050", "label": {"eng": "Mark Thoma"}}]}

She said there is roughly an equal chance that the Fed is forced to raise rates more or less aggressively than currently planned in the months and years ahead.\n\nThe dollar continued its positive start to week, as solid retail sales data on Tuesday overshadowed a slump in U.S. housing data amid growing expectations the Fed will increase interest rates for a third time later this year.\n\nHousing starts dropped 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.16 million units, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.\n\nThe unexpected dip in housing starts, however, didn't deter investor expectations of a rate hike later this year. According to investing.com's fed rate monitor tool, nearly 50% of traders expect the Fed to hike rates in December, compared to just 37% last week.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 100, "id": 623, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "wgt": 100, "id": 1221, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242096"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302736", "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302993", "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303074", "label": {"eng": "Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303083", "label": {"eng": "Investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303410", "label": {"eng": "Trade"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303540"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304196", "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304655", "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "307046", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311448", "label": {"eng": "Third-rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313321", "label": {"eng": "Economic data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317510", "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_adjustment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "319731", "label": {"eng": "Seasonal adjustment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "327901", "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_starts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "357817", "label": {"eng": "Housing starts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}]}

One camp is worried about the low-inflation environment while the other is worried about a jump in inflation if there is a delay.\n\nThe minutes cover the July meeting at which central bank policymakers voted to hold the target rate in the range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The minutes include a summary of FOMC member views that inflation ultimately will get to the Fed's 2 percent target but is clearly not there yet.\n\nThe more dovish meeting participants expressed \"concern about the recent decline in inflation\" and said the Fed \"could afford to be patient under current circumstances.\" The \"argued against additional adjustments\" until the central bank was sure that inflation was on track.\n\nThe more hawkish FOMC members \"worried about risks arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further.\" They also argued that delaying a steady dose of rate hikes could cause the Fed to overshoot its employment target and cause financial instability.\n\nFOMC members also agreed that the process of reducing the Fed's massive balance sheet should begin \"relatively soon,\" with some members arguing for a more concrete date to be set. Analysts and traders largely expect the Fed to announce the plan to begin the trimming of the balance sheet at its September meeting. The process should then begin shortly thereafter.\n\nIn their assessment of the economy, the FOMC members were largely impressed, especially in the areas of employment and household spending. Members did express some concerns over June's weak retail sales, which bounced back strong in July, and stagnant wage growth.\n\nFed officials were less optimistic about the federal government doing its part to stimulate the economy through fiscal policy. They are hoping President Trump and Congress get together on tax reform and increased infrastructure spending.\n\n\"Several participants noted that uncertainty about the course of federal government policy, including in the areas of fiscal policy, trade, and health care, was tending to weigh down firms' spending and hiring plans,\" the minutes stated.\n\n\"In addition, a few participants suggested that the likelihood of near-term enactment of a fiscal stimulus program had declined further or that the fiscal stimulus likely would be smaller than they previously expected.\"\n\nThe next Fed meeting is in September. At this time, the market is pricing in no chance of a rate hike. However, the chances are 50/50 that rates will be hiked in December.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE: All the Reasons why Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $4000, What's Next?

Could you tell us, are you lowering it now, that his program is -- your own personal forecast -- are you lowering it given that his economic program is at the moment stalled? Any comments?\n\nWILLIAM DUDLEY: My outlook for the economy hasn't changed materially since the beginning of the year. Continue to look for growths around 2%, slightly above trend, growth sufficient to continue to tighten the labor market. I did not raise my growth forecast after the Election because of the prospect of fiscal stimulus because I felt that there was a lot of uncertainty about how big it would be, what its composition would be, and when it would actually take effect.\n\nSo, I always viewed it as a risk to the forecast. In other words, an upside risk to the forecast, but I never put it into my baseline forecast.\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as the U.S. Trade and Development Agency and Small Business Administration explore the hybrid IT environment in government.\n\nI think we're still on the same trajectory we've been on for several years. Above trend growth, gradually tightening labor market, inflation -- somewhat below our objective -- but we do expect as the labor market continues to tighten, to see firmer wage gains and that will ultimately filter into inflation moving up towards our 2% objective.\n\nQ: What do you see as the evidence for the labor market tightening?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think you can see it just directly in the unemployment rate, 4.3%, that's the lowest unemployment rate we've had in many years. If you look at some of the broader measures of unemployment, they have also come down to levels that we reached prior to the great recession. So, a pretty broad range of evidence that suggests the labor market is quite a bit tighter than it's been in many years. Which is a good thing.\n\nQ: Sure. In an appearance last week you said that the inflation that you look at might not get back up to 2% for 6 to 10 months, just given ... Given that outlook, why be thinking of raising rates at all?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, the reason why inflation won't get up to 2% very quickly on a year-over-year basis is because we've had these very low inflation readings over the last 4 or 5 months. So it's going to take time for those to sort of drop out of the year-over-year calculation.\n\nBut I think if you look at inflation sequentially, in other words what's inflation likely to actually do over the next 6 months, I'm expecting somewhat higher readings than what we've had over the last 6 months.\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nNow the reason why I think you'd want to continue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation, even with inflation somewhat below target, is that 1) monetary policy is still accommodative, so the level of short-term rates is pretty low, and 2) and this is probably even more important, financial conditions have been easing rather than tightening. So despite the fact that we've raised short-term interest rates, financial conditions are easier today than they were a year ago.\n\nThe stock market's up, credit spreads have narrowed, the dollar has weakened, and those have more than offset the effects of somewhat higher short-term rates and the very modest increases that we've seen in longer-term yields.\n\nQ: The markets right now are putting about a 50-50 odds of even a rate hike as late as December. Is it likely that 2 may be it for this year?\n\nDUDLEY: I think it depends on how the economic forecast evolves. If it evolves in line with my expectations, I would expect -- I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\n\nQ: Speaking a little more broadly about the issue of inflation, as you know of course there's a school of thought that says that we are in an environment where low inflation may persist far longer than anybody expects. One, it's not just domestically but globally as well.\n\nNobody knows, of course, whether that's correct or not. But we obviously do see very, very low inflation globally. Forecasts, including the Fed's own forecasts of inflation going back 2, 3, 4 years have consistently proved below what turned out to be reality.\n\nHow do you wrestle, or how do you reconcile the Fed's plans or policymaking with the idea that we may be in a long-term environment. Or, an environment of long-term persistently low inflation, and that perhaps the Fed should walk away from a 2% target? Or adjust it, or just in some ways, come to grips with the reality, or the potential reality, that we're in a very, very low inflation environment going forward for a long time?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think there's a fundamental question about whether are we in a new regime or is it just going to take some time for the inflation to move higher? There are long lags between getting to a tight labor market and that actually showing up in higher wages, and those wages then pushing into inflation.\n\nSo, I think the jury's out of whether there is sort of structural, secular changes in place that are holding inflation lower on a sustained basis.\n\nI mean one can identify some reasons for thinking that that could continue the ability for consumers and businesses to see what the prices of goods and services are broadly across a wide range of people selling goods and services is very, very good.\n\nThe distribution methods of how goods and services are provided have changed pretty dramatically. So this -- and I think that's probably eroding pricing power and brand loyalty. It's possible that that could be putting downward pressure on inflation.\n\nBut if that's the case, that's not really a bad thing. That means we can actually allow the economy to operate at a higher level potentially of resource utilization.\n\nIf it's true that inflation is going to be lower on a secular basis, that should allow us to continue to let the economy run a little bit longer. And continue to have above-trend job gains and to see the unemployment rate even move a little bit lower.\n\nSo, I think the jury is out, whether this lags or is just going to take some time for it to show through, or whether we're in a different regime.\n\nI think the next 4 to 6 months I think are going to be important to see whether the readings that we've had over the last few months are mainly due to one-off factors, such as the big decline that we've seen in cellphone prices, or whether there's something more fundamental going on.\n\nQ: Would you entertain at least the possibility that the Fed might at some point just have to suspend its rate increases, just to deal with the reality that rates remain persistently low?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that if the economy continues to grow above trend, and the labor market continues to tighten, I do think we'll get to the point where that will lead to higher wages and that will show up in terms of higher inflation.\n\nNow, the question is at what level of the unemployment rate will that all take place? So, if there are these secular forces that are pushing inflation lower, perhaps we can actually go to a somewhat lower unemployment rate. I would actually view -- rather than people wringing their hands that this is so awful that inflation is low, it actually might be a good thing because it could allow you to run the economy at a little bit higher level of resource utilization, which I think ... people get employed, they get job skills, they'd be able to build their human capital over time. (00:07:29) The productive capacity of the U.S. economy would be greater -- all those things would be good things.\n\nWhat we have to do, though, to discern is, what we see on inflation, is this temporary or is this something that's going to be more persistent?\n\nQ: Given this nine-year period of very low rates, it has spawned talk about asset bubbles. Stock prices are record levels. Bond prices are up. Alan Greenspan said the bond market is going to collapse as you raise rates. Are you concerned about asset bubbles?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean obviously, we need to continue to always look at the financial system to see whether there are misaligned asset prices that are misaligned relative to the fundamentals because if the asset prices were to move sharply, that would presumably create quite a bit of stress on the financial system.\n\nThen the question is could the financial system withstand that stress? So, this is something we do look at on a regular basis.\n\nMy own view is that -- I'm not particularly concerned about where our asset prices are today for a couple of reasons. The main one is that I think that the asset prices are pretty consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy.\n\nThe economy has been evolving in a very low volatility way, 2% growth a year, pretty steady. Inflation has stayed low. There is not much volatility in the economy, and I think that's translated to low volatility in financial asset markets, and that's actually helped lift valuations.\n\nNow obviously this means that if the economic outlook changed, if we got a lot more volatility in terms of the economy, then that could potentially prove problematic for financial markets.\n\nBut right now, it seems to me like the financial statements are behaving in a way that's consistent with the economic environment that we're seeing. If the financial statements were behaving in a way inconsistent with the economic environment that we've been seeing, I'd be much more concerned.\n\nQ: Of course speaking just to that question here, there is some concern that the Fed's accommodative rates, although they've come up somewhat, it's still so accommodative that -- and bond yields are so low, that obviously investors are pouring more and more money into equities because that's where the returns are.\n\nAnd so the concern is that those equity prices don't necessarily just reflect the economic fundamentals, but of course, reflect people. As bubbles form, people put things in assets they feel are going to continue to keep going up because the other options are not as appealing. Is that a concern?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we're going to continue to review what we're seeing in terms of asset prices. The other positive, too, I think though is that if asset prices go down, what's the consequence of that for the stability of the financial system? Well, I think the financial system is a much, much stronger place today than it was prior to the financial crisis and the Great Recession. Banks have more capital, they have more liquidity while we've corrected I think some of the structural weaknesses in the financial system.\n\nI don't think it's reasonable to think that the Federal Reserve is somehow going to manage financial asset prices so that they are completely stable over time. They are going to go up and down, depending on the economic environment.\n\nWhat we have to be cautious of is making sure that the financial system is robust, so that if there is weakness in financial asset prices, it doesn't contribute to a great stress in the financial system, which then spills into the real economy, to try to avoid what happened during the Great Recession.\n\nQ: There's a widely-held view in financial markets that come September, the Fed will announce that it's starting to trim its balance sheet. Is that view correct?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, we obviously have to have the FOMC meeting to make that decision at the next FOMC meeting. But, I don't think the expectations of market participants are unreasonable. In June, following the June FOMC meeting, we laid out a plan in terms of how we would actually do our balance sheet normalization. How we would allow Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to gradually run off our portfolio over time.\n\nAnd so the plan is out there. It's been I think generally well-received, and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place. In the last FOMC statement, we said that we expected this to happen relatively soon. So, I expect it to happen relatively soon.\n\nQ: And how -- just in a process -- the announcement would come in September, you've got things like the debt ceiling, all of that. Would you expect the actual implementation in October, or would that be delayed? How would that process work?\n\nDUDLEY: First of all, we haven't made any decision yet about whether we're actually going to start in September. So, if we were to start in September, does a debt limit ceiling discussion -- debate -- create difficulties for us? I would say not really, in the sense that the debt that we hold counts against the debt limit, just like the debt held by the private sector.\n\nIn some ways, we're really not part of the -- it doesn't affect -- whether we start or don't start doesn't have really any effect about when the debt limit will actually be binding.\n\nAnd second of all, we can obviously announce the start of the program but delay the actual start date. So I think that -- I don't think the debt limit will have big impact on our decision about whether to start or not start the balance sheet normalization process.\n\nQ: On the issue of the balance sheet, you've suggested that reduction in the balance sheet can affect asset prices differently from an increase in the Funds Rate. Could you speak a little bit about what kind of consequences people can expect -- ordinary people, ordinary businesses -- from the gradual reduction of the balance sheet?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, we need to be somewhat humble about what we know about this because we've never done this before. And that's why I think we've been very, very careful in terms of how we've gradually rolled this out, so that people can see how we're planning to do this.\n\nIt's one of the reasons why the reinvestment process, phasing that down, is going to happen very gradually, that we're not just going to stop abruptly because we want to make sure that the adjustments are small, the model is gentle, and don't have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nSo far I would say that the market reaction has been extraordinarily mild. As expectations have gone from relatively low probability that we're going to start this to a very high probability that we're going to start this relatively soon. And so that makes me more confident that when we start, it's not going to have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nFinally what I would expect is over time, as the Federal Reserve allows its portfolio to run down, that means the private sector has to absorb somewhat larger amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, that will probably put some modest upward pressure on long-term yields.\n\nBut I wouldn't expect it to be very large for a number of reasons. One, it's already anticipated that this is going to happen. And 2) the balance sheet is going to shrink, but we're not going back to where we were in 2007, when the balance sheet was 800 billion.\n\nSo, the shrinkage of the balance sheet is going to be a lot smaller than the increase in the balance sheet that happened before.\n\nQ: ... mortgage rates or business loans. You feel like the economy can absorb that?\n\nDUDLEY: Yes, yes. I mean right now, long-term rates are very, very low. If you had asked me a few years ago could the U.S. economy get to a 4.3% unemployment rate and the Federal Reserve was gradually tightening monetary policy, and 10-year Treasury yields would be 2-1/4%, I would have been quite surprised. (LAUGHTER)\n\nQ: On the balance sheet, Chair Yellen has talked a little bit in her testimony about where it could end up. It's not going to go back to 800 billion, pre-Crisis. Where do you think it might end up?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think that's quite uncertain still because the Federal Reserve has really not made any final decisions about what kind of operating framework we want to have over the longer-term. You can have an operating framework, there's really sort of two broad choices, one where there's just a tiny amount of reserves in the banking system.\n\nThat's what we used prior to the financial crisis. Or a regime, which is called a floor system, where there is quite a bit more reserves in the banking system so the balance sheet would be larger as a consequence.\n\nThe first thing is we have to make that decision, are we going to go back to the old regime where it's just a small amount of reserves in the banking system, or are we going to actually continue with a floor system?\n\nMy own personal view as someone who actually ran the Open Market Desk during the Financial Crisis is I very much favor retaining a floor system, so that would imply more excess reserves in the banking system, and a somewhat bigger balance sheet.\n\nSo, that's the first issue.\n\nThe second issue is we really don't know how much excess reserves we need in the banking system for a floor system to operate efficiently without a lot of day-to-day intervention. Presumably, if we move to a floor system over the longer-term, we're going to want to have enough excess reserves in the banking system, so we don't have to intervene on a day-by-day basis.\n\nIf you have to intervene on a day-by-day basis, you're sort of undermining the whole advantage of operating a floor system.\n\nSo, I think at the end of the day, we're going to sort of learn about how much reserves we're going to need in the -- we're going to make a decision about whether it's going to be a floor system or a recorder system. And then if we decide on a floor system, we're going to learn about how much excess reserves we actually need.\n\nMy own view is, if I had to say today, we're probably going to see a balance sheet five years from now that's probably in the order of 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 trillion rather than the 4-1/2 trillion dollar balance sheet.\n\nBut that's just a rough guess. It depends on a lot of different factors, like how fast does currency grow over the next 5 years.\n\nSo, I think the main point I would want to make about the size of the balance sheet, we're not going back to 800 billion. That's really the thing to underscore. But there's quite a bit of uncertainty about where we're going to actually end up at this point.\n\nQ: You feel good though in this process, that we're not going to have a repeat of 2013, a Taper Tantrum, where we -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I hope so. I mean we've been trying to do this in a way -- being very sensitive to that experience. So making sure that we're gradually educating people about how this balance sheet normalization process works. We're doing it -- we're phasing down the reinvestment at a gradual pace. So the First Quarter when we actually implement this program, only 6 billion of Treasury securities will run off each month. Only 4 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities. And then it gradually phases up over the next three quarters.\n\nSo, all these things are done in part to make sure that there's not a large financial statement reaction, and the fact that so far as we've rolled this out, the markets have responded quite benignly makes me confident that we can avoid the kind of Taper Tantrum that we saw in 2013.\n\nQ: We're at a point now looking at a major amount of change in the makeup of the Federal Reserve Board, and also the Regional Presidents for that matter. A lot of new faces coming on.\n\nIs there a concern that with that much changeover -- I mean you've got three openings now. You could have two more next year possibly. You've got four Regional Fed Presidents who've been there less than 2 years, and likely more. Can the Federal Reserve system -- how is it going to handle all of this change?\n\nDUDLEY: It's not something that I have a great concern about because the mission doesn't change. So Congress has set for the Federal Reserve the dual mandate, responsibilities of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. And we define price stability as 2% inflation.\n\nSo anybody coming onto the Fed -- the mission, that's the mission. And that doesn't change.\n\nThe second thing I would say is that the committee really does have a very strong consensus currently, in terms of what it wants to do going forward. The fact that the addendum to the balance sheet -- to the normalization plans -- was supported by every FOMC participant suggests that there's really strong support for the direction that the Federal Reserve is moving.\n\nAnd lastly, I expect that the new people will be very capable people, and I think they're going to make decisions in a way, very consistent with what we've been doing in recent years.\n\nSo this is not something that I'm concerned about it.\n\nQ: More specifically, President Trump of course has ... the 5 board members he could be appointing within now to the next 10 to 12 months. Given the President's style of seeming to prefer loyalty among appointees that he makes to all sorts of federal positions, does it concern you that the Fed's independence, especially the Board's, could be imperiled in any way by the people he puts in there, and the expectations he has for them?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is ultimately a creature of Congress, and Congress sets the mandate for the Fed, and I think the Fed needs then to be evaluated vis-a-vis that mandate.\n\nAnd so I think anybody coming in is going to feel this is my job, to try to achieve these dual mandate objectives.\n\nThe second thing I would say is the Trump Administration has been very hands-off in terms of the Fed. So, I think they've been very respectful of the monetary policy, not to politicize the monetary policy process. And that's continuing a very long tradition that's been place for going back, really, 25 years to the Clinton Administration, when Bob Rubin was the head of the National Economic Council in the Clinton Administration.\n\nI think we've actually seen a very consistent process of how the administration treats the Fed that's very -- I don't see any meaningful change from what we saw under the Obama Administration or prior administrations.\n\nQ: The Republicans in Congress though have really been pushing in monetary policy a rules-based system. Some of the candidates -- John Taylor -- has rules. Will that change how you set monetary policy? Would you have those kinds of folks coming on?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, you know, it's a committee, and so there's lots of people on the committee. We'll have to see how it all evolves. My own view is, I've been very clear on record that I'm not in favor of a mechanical use of a monetary policy rule.\n\nI think monetary policy rules are useful, as guides, as an input to the monetary policy-setting process. But mechanically using a monetary policy rule I think could lead to pretty significant mistakes in terms of monetary policy.\n\nAnd the example I like to use is what was the Taylor rule calling for in September 2008, when we met in terms of monetary policy? Well, it was saying that the Federal Funds Rate needed to rise significantly in the Fourth Quarter of 2008, which obviously would have been a disaster because the economy was in free-fall.\n\nThe problem with these mechanical rules is they don't really incorporate all the information that's relevant to the monetary policy setting process.\n\nSo, at the September 2008 meeting, Lehman Brothers had just failed. Clearly, this was going to have pretty significant effects on the financial system as we saw. And the U.S. economy was entering a pretty deep recession. This was not the time to be raising interest rates. So, I think the rules are fine as a guide to policy, as an input of policy, and if you look at the documents that accompanied the FOMC meetings that are part of the historical record, you'll see that various monetary policy rules are part of our deliberations. Just don't force us to use them mechanically.\n\nQ: In the area of bank regulation, President Trump was very critical of Dodd-Frank. Republicans in Congress are trying to change it. Do you expect more changes there in how the Fed regulates the banks?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that we -- there are some changes to Dodd-Frank that would be completely appropriate. I've been on record, and other Fed officials have been on record, as arguing for relief for smaller banking institutions. Smaller banking institutions don't create systemic risks to the financial system, so I think they can be treated differently than large banking institutions.\n\nSo, that's certainly something that I think could be done. I think the Volcker Rule could probably be implemented in a way that made it less of a burden for banking firms. The Volcker Rule actually applies to very small banks, which makes very little sense to me.\n\nBut it's important also not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The increase in capital requirements and liquidity requirements I think was very important. We need to keep that. The stress test that the Federal Reserve conducts on banks in order to stress their capital levels, I think is very, very important to retain.\n\nI think that some of the things in the Dodd-Frank Act, like the ability to resolve large systemic institutions without that threatening the rest of the financial system, very, very important that we retain that.\n\nThere is legislation that's been proposed in the House that would eliminate Title 2 of the Dodd-Frank Act. This is the Title that basically says that the FDIC can convert the firm to a new company by converting debt into equity. If you get rid of that, you need something in its place.\n\nMy view is that if a large firm were to get into difficulty and fail, you need 2 things. You need to be able to resolve it over a weekend and you need a source of liquidity on Monday morning because people will run from that institution.\n\nIf you don't have that, you will have a financial crisis that spreads, that has significant contagion. So, you can fix Dodd-Frank in a lot of ways. But it's really important to have the ability to resolve large institutions over the weekend and have a source of liquidity so that when businesses and households run from that troubled institution, there's a source of funding so that entity can be recapitalized and continue to go on.\n\nQ: On a personal level, Gary Cohn has been mentioned as potentially a Fed Chair if Yellen were not to be reappointed or declined. Did you work with Gary Cohn at Goldman Sachs? What is your impression of him as a potential Federal Reserve Chair?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't want to evaluate the various candidates for the Federal Reserve, except to say that I think Gary is a reasonable candidate. He knows a lot about financial markets. He knows lots about the financial system. I don't think you have to have a PhD in Economics, which I have, to be a Chair of the Fed or Governor or a President of one of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nI think it's important to have a committee that has diversity. That has different backgrounds and perspectives. So I think Gary's a reasonable candidate.\n\nQ: Not going to go there. One of the things that has been discussed is the income inequality. It's gotten to be such a problem. Should the Fed accept some responsibility for the widening in income inequality, just by how they've handled rates and the fact that the wealthy who own stocks and other assets have benefited very well?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think monetary policy really isn't a tool that's well-suited to address issues of income inequality or income mobility. There's a whole other set of tools I think that can address those type of issues. Tax policy, education policy, access to opportunities. I just think it's sort of outside the Fed's purview.\n\nObviously, we care deeply about income inequality and income mobility, and I've been talking about it on a regular basis.\n\nI actually think that the income mobility issue is probably just as important -- or maybe even more important -- than the income inequality issue because I can understand why someone just starting out in their career gets paid less than someone who has a lot more experience and brings a lot more value to a firm.\n\nI understand that kind of income inequality. What I find a lot harder to justify is the fact that a lot of research has shown that where you're born, literally the physical location of where you're born, affects your ability to move up the income mobility scale over time, which seems extraordinarily unfair to me.\n\nSo, we've been putting a lot of emphasis at the bank on really trying to understand the issues of income mobility and trying to raise this issue in terms of people's consciousness. And try to develop more of a dialogue about what we could actually do about it, which I think is job training, it's access to opportunities.\n\nSome of the cities that we travel to around the Second District, there are jobs available in the suburbs, and the people in the inner city can't get to those jobs. So, sometimes it's just things simple like transportation. The ability of people to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\nI think that not providing people with opportunities I think is bad.\n\nQ: Who's to blame for this then?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we've just -- I think there hasn't been enough focus on the consequences of globalization, which I think have left people behind. And I think there hasn't been enough focus on trying to improve the opportunities for all Americans, not just some Americans.\n\nSo, that's what I'd like to see happen in the coming years.\n\nQ: We're in an unusual policy mix at the moment. You've got North Korea. Very big threat there. A variety of issues going on. Is this a hard time for Fed policymakers in particular, just because of the seeming gridlock in Washington and the heightened rhetoric that's out and about?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think this is a particularly tough time. I certainly would rather be here than back in 2007, 2008. If you look at where we are, the economy is growing above trend, the unemployment rate is at 4.3%. Inflation is a little bit below our target, but not a lot below our target, so we're not missing our inflation objective by a huge margin.\n\nIf you look at what economists call the so-called Misery Index, the sum of inflation plus unemployment, we're probably at one of the best places we've been at for the last 50 years.\n\nSo, if we could just stay here -- (LAUGHS) -- and emulate Australia which is in their 26th year of economic expansion, that would be great.\n\nI think this is a good place to be, and I'm hoping that we can just act in a way to sustain this economic expansion so it can benefit a broader set of Americans.\n\nQ: We're in the third longest, now in our 9th year -- 10 years has been the maximum. When does the next recession happen?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think that economic expansions die from old age. I think they die because either the economy is hit with a very adverse shock. Oftentimes those are very difficult to anticipate. Or because inflation gets out of hand and the Federal Reserve has to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation under control.\n\nClearly, we don't have that latter problem right now. The Fed has no reason in my view to act aggressively to tighten monetary policy. If you look at what we've done, we've been very, very gentle in terms of how we've been removing monetary policy accommodation.\n\nAnd as long as inflation stays low, I think that's going to continue. So, certainly, there is very little risk to the expansion coming from the Fed.\n\nYou could also look at the economy. It seems to be in pretty good balance. The household sector I think is well-supported by rising wages and strong job growth and a good balance sheet.\n\nI think that the international outlook has improved, and the dollar has weakened, and I think that provides support to business fixed investment spending and the country's trade performance.\n\nSo, yes, it's a pretty long-lived expansion but I don't really see things on the horizon. Knock on wood.\n\nQ: You see no bubbles of any assets? Because that ultimately is what --\n\nDUDLEY: I mean that's too strong. I mean I think there are areas where you could sort of say, boy, asset prices might be somewhat overvalued in certain areas. But this is totally different than -- not 2007. The housing market was up dramatically. It's a hugely big market in terms of dollar value.\n\nSo when that started to unwind, the amount of stress that it put on the financial system was severe, and we had a much more fragile financial system at the time.\n\nI think we're in a very different place than we were then.\n\nDUDLEY: Well, productivity growth is the key driver. I mean Real GDP growth is really the sum of how much labor input you have, plus how much productivity is increasing per an hour worked. So the way to get growth -- in the labor force, growth rate is really driven by demographics and immigration policy.\n\nSo, the labor force is not growing that fast. The only way you're going to get to a higher growth rate is by raising the productivity growth rate. And we'll see. Obviously, to the extent that you have some regulatory relief, that will probably push you in the right direction. It's possible that there could be new technological discoveries and dissemination of those technologies that can raise productivity growth over time.\n\nBut it's really productivity growth that we need to be focused on if we're going to try to get to a higher sustainable Real GDP growth rate.\n\nQ: So, at the moment, no change in the Fed long term forecast?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean we've had a period of years where productivity growth has disappointed. The last year it's a little bit better. We're above 1% over the last four quarters, so we'll see.\n\nI mean this is very difficult to forecast. Obviously I would hope for higher productivity growth rather than lower productivity growth because that would boost people's standards of livings. Their real incomes would rise over time.\n\nSo, I'm in favor of Congress and the Administration, and state and local governments, doing things that raise productivity growth. Part of it's giving people better job skills, better opportunities. Removing unnecessary regulatory burden, when that's appropriate.\n\nIf we can do those things, probably we can get productivity up a bit. But I think we have to be realistic about how little we know about our ability to forecast productivity on a going-forward basis.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "12"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "120"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302591", "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302993", "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302995", "label": {"eng": "Asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303058", "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303068", "label": {"eng": "Financial statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303101", "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303187", "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303277", "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303547", "label": {"eng": "Money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304014", "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304020", "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304051", "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304196", "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304197", "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304230", "label": {"eng": "Globalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "309616", "label": {"eng": "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "324974", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "330705", "label": {"eng": "Alan Greenspan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "337517", "label": {"eng": "Lehman Brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cohn_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "397337", "label": {"eng": "Gary Cohn (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rubin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "647051", "label": {"eng": "Robert Rubin"}}]}

Could you tell us, are you lowering it now, that his program is -- your own personal forecast -- are you lowering it given that his economic program is at the moment stalled? Any comments?\n\nWILLIAM DUDLEY: My outlook for the economy hasn't changed materially since the beginning of the year. Continue to look for growths around 2%, slightly above trend, growth sufficient to continue to tighten the labor market. I did not raise my growth forecast after the Election because of the prospect of fiscal stimulus because I felt that there was a lot of uncertainty about how big it would be, what its composition would be, and when it would actually take effect.\n\nSo, I always viewed it as a risk to the forecast. In other words, an upside risk to the forecast, but I never put it into my baseline forecast.\n\nI think we're still on the same trajectory we've been on for several years. Above trend growth, gradually tightening labor market, inflation -- somewhat below our objective -- but we do expect as the labor market continues to tighten, to see firmer wage gains and that will ultimately filter into inflation moving up towards our 2% objective.\n\nQ: What do you see as the evidence for the labor market tightening?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think you can see it just directly in the unemployment rate, 4.3%, that's the lowest unemployment rate we've had in many years. If you look at some of the broader measures of unemployment, they have also come down to levels that we reached prior to the great recession. So, a pretty broad range of evidence that suggests the labor market is quite a bit tighter than it's been in many years. Which is a good thing.\n\nQ: Sure. In an appearance last week you said that the inflation that you look at might not get back up to 2% for 6 to 10 months, just given ... Given that outlook, why be thinking of raising rates at all?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, the reason why inflation won't get up to 2% very quickly on a year-over-year basis is because we've had these very low inflation readings over the last 4 or 5 months. So it's going to take time for those to sort of drop out of the year-over-year calculation.\n\nBut I think if you look at inflation sequentially, in other words what's inflation likely to actually do over the next 6 months, I'm expecting somewhat higher readings than what we've had over the last 6 months.\n\nNow the reason why I think you'd want to continue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation, even with inflation somewhat below target, is that 1) monetary policy is still accommodative, so the level of short-term rates is pretty low, and 2) and this is probably even more important, financial conditions have been easing rather than tightening. So despite the fact that we've raised short-term interest rates, financial conditions are easier today than they were a year ago.\n\nThe stock market's up, credit spreads have narrowed, the dollar has weakened, and those have more than offset the effects of somewhat higher short-term rates and the very modest increases that we've seen in longer-term yields.\n\nQ: The markets right now are putting about a 50-50 odds of even a rate hike as late as December. Is it likely that 2 may be it for this year?\n\nDUDLEY: I think it depends on how the economic forecast evolves. If it evolves in line with my expectations, I would expect -- I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\n\nQ: Speaking a little more broadly about the issue of inflation, as you know of course there's a school of thought that says that we are in an environment where low inflation may persist far longer than anybody expects. One, it's not just domestically but globally as well.\n\nNobody knows, of course, whether that's correct or not. But we obviously do see very, very low inflation globally. Forecasts, including the Fed's own forecasts of inflation going back 2, 3, 4 years have consistently proved below what turned out to be reality.\n\nHow do you wrestle, or how do you reconcile the Fed's plans or policymaking with the idea that we may be in a long-term environment. Or, an environment of long-term persistently low inflation, and that perhaps the Fed should walk away from a 2% target? Or adjust it, or just in some ways, come to grips with the reality, or the potential reality, that we're in a very, very low inflation environment going forward for a long time?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think there's a fundamental question about whether are we in a new regime or is it just going to take some time for the inflation to move higher? There are long lags between getting to a tight labor market and that actually showing up in higher wages, and those wages then pushing into inflation.\n\nSo, I think the jury's out of whether there is sort of structural, secular changes in place that are holding inflation lower on a sustained basis.\n\nI mean one can identify some reasons for thinking that that could continue the ability for consumers and businesses to see what the prices of goods and services are broadly across a wide range of people selling goods and services is very, very good.\n\nThe distribution methods of how goods and services are provided have changed pretty dramatically. So this -- and I think that's probably eroding pricing power and brand loyalty. It's possible that that could be putting downward pressure on inflation.\n\nBut if that's the case, that's not really a bad thing. That means we can actually allow the economy to operate at a higher level potentially of resource utilization.\n\nIf it's true that inflation is going to be lower on a secular basis, that should allow us to continue to let the economy run a little bit longer. And continue to have above-trend job gains and to see the unemployment rate even move a little bit lower.\n\nSo, I think the jury is out, whether this lags or is just going to take some time for it to show through, or whether we're in a different regime.\n\nI think the next 4 to 6 months I think are going to be important to see whether the readings that we've had over the last few months are mainly due to one-off factors, such as the big decline that we've seen in cellphone prices, or whether there's something more fundamental going on.\n\nQ: Would you entertain at least the possibility that the Fed might at some point just have to suspend its rate increases, just to deal with the reality that rates remain persistently low?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that if the economy continues to grow above trend, and the labor market continues to tighten, I do think we'll get to the point where that will lead to higher wages and that will show up in terms of higher inflation.\n\nNow, the question is at what level of the unemployment rate will that all take place? So, if there are these secular forces that are pushing inflation lower, perhaps we can actually go to a somewhat lower unemployment rate. I would actually view -- rather than people wringing their hands that this is so awful that inflation is low, it actually might be a good thing because it could allow you to run the economy at a little bit higher level of resource utilization, which I think ... people get employed, they get job skills, they'd be able to build their human capital over time. (00:07:29) The productive capacity of the U.S. economy would be greater -- all those things would be good things.\n\nWhat we have to do, though, to discern is, what we see on inflation, is this temporary or is this something that's going to be more persistent?\n\nQ: Given this nine-year period of very low rates, it has spawned talk about asset bubbles. Stock prices are record levels. Bond prices are up. Alan Greenspan said the bond market is going to collapse as you raise rates. Are you concerned about asset bubbles?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean obviously, we need to continue to always look at the financial system to see whether there are misaligned asset prices that are misaligned relative to the fundamentals because if the asset prices were to move sharply, that would presumably create quite a bit of stress on the financial system.\n\nThen the question is could the financial system withstand that stress? So, this is something we do look at on a regular basis.\n\nMy own view is that -- I'm not particularly concerned about where our asset prices are today for a couple of reasons. The main one is that I think that the asset prices are pretty consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy.\n\nThe economy has been evolving in a very low volatility way, 2% growth a year, pretty steady. Inflation has stayed low. There is not much volatility in the economy, and I think that's translated to low volatility in financial asset markets, and that's actually helped lift valuations.\n\nNow obviously this means that if the economic outlook changed, if we got a lot more volatility in terms of the economy, then that could potentially prove problematic for financial markets.\n\nBut right now, it seems to me like the financial statements are behaving in a way that's consistent with the economic environment that we're seeing. If the financial statements were behaving in a way inconsistent with the economic environment that we've been seeing, I'd be much more concerned.\n\nQ: Of course speaking just to that question here, there is some concern that the Fed's accommodative rates, although they've come up somewhat, it's still so accommodative that -- and bond yields are so low, that obviously investors are pouring more and more money into equities because that's where the returns are.\n\nAnd so the concern is that those equity prices don't necessarily just reflect the economic fundamentals, but of course, reflect people. As bubbles form, people put things in assets they feel are going to continue to keep going up because the other options are not as appealing. Is that a concern?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we're going to continue to review what we're seeing in terms of asset prices. The other positive, too, I think though is that if asset prices go down, what's the consequence of that for the stability of the financial system? Well, I think the financial system is a much, much stronger place today than it was prior to the financial crisis and the Great Recession. Banks have more capital, they have more liquidity while we've corrected I think some of the structural weaknesses in the financial system.\n\nI don't think it's reasonable to think that the Federal Reserve is somehow going to manage financial asset prices so that they are completely stable over time. They are going to go up and down, depending on the economic environment.\n\nWhat we have to be cautious of is making sure that the financial system is robust, so that if there is weakness in financial asset prices, it doesn't contribute to a great stress in the financial system, which then spills into the real economy, to try to avoid what happened during the Great Recession.\n\nQ: There's a widely-held view in financial markets that come September, the Fed will announce that it's starting to trim its balance sheet. Is that view correct?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, we obviously have to have the FOMC meeting to make that decision at the next FOMC meeting. But, I don't think the expectations of market participants are unreasonable. In June, following the June FOMC meeting, we laid out a plan in terms of how we would actually do our balance sheet normalization. How we would allow Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to gradually run off our portfolio over time.\n\nAnd so the plan is out there. It's been I think generally well-received, and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place. In the last FOMC statement, we said that we expected this to happen relatively soon. So, I expect it to happen relatively soon.\n\nQ: And how -- just in a process -- the announcement would come in September, you've got things like the debt ceiling, all of that. Would you expect the actual implementation in October, or would that be delayed? How would that process work?\n\nDUDLEY: First of all, we haven't made any decision yet about whether we're actually going to start in September. So, if we were to start in September, does a debt limit ceiling discussion -- debate -- create difficulties for us? I would say not really, in the sense that the debt that we hold counts against the debt limit, just like the debt held by the private sector.\n\nIn some ways, we're really not part of the -- it doesn't affect -- whether we start or don't start doesn't have really any effect about when the debt limit will actually be binding.\n\nAnd second of all, we can obviously announce the start of the program but delay the actual start date. So I think that -- I don't think the debt limit will have big impact on our decision about whether to start or not start the balance sheet normalization process.\n\nQ: On the issue of the balance sheet, you've suggested that reduction in the balance sheet can affect asset prices differently from an increase in the Funds Rate. Could you speak a little bit about what kind of consequences people can expect -- ordinary people, ordinary businesses -- from the gradual reduction of the balance sheet?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, we need to be somewhat humble about what we know about this because we've never done this before. And that's why I think we've been very, very careful in terms of how we've gradually rolled this out, so that people can see how we're planning to do this.\n\nIt's one of the reasons why the reinvestment process, phasing that down, is going to happen very gradually, that we're not just going to stop abruptly because we want to make sure that the adjustments are small, the model is gentle, and don't have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nSo far I would say that the market reaction has been extraordinarily mild. As expectations have gone from relatively low probability that we're going to start this to a very high probability that we're going to start this relatively soon. And so that makes me more confident that when we start, it's not going to have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nFinally what I would expect is over time, as the Federal Reserve allows its portfolio to run down, that means the private sector has to absorb somewhat larger amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, that will probably put some modest upward pressure on long-term yields.\n\nBut I wouldn't expect it to be very large for a number of reasons. One, it's already anticipated that this is going to happen. And 2) the balance sheet is going to shrink, but we're not going back to where we were in 2007, when the balance sheet was 800 billion.\n\nSo, the shrinkage of the balance sheet is going to be a lot smaller than the increase in the balance sheet that happened before.\n\nQ: ... mortgage rates or business loans. You feel like the economy can absorb that?\n\nDUDLEY: Yes, yes. I mean right now, long-term rates are very, very low. If you had asked me a few years ago could the U.S. economy get to a 4.3% unemployment rate and the Federal Reserve was gradually tightening monetary policy, and 10-year Treasury yields would be 2-1/4%, I would have been quite surprised. (LAUGHTER)\n\nQ: On the balance sheet, Chair Yellen has talked a little bit in her testimony about where it could end up. It's not going to go back to 800 billion, pre-Crisis. Where do you think it might end up?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think that's quite uncertain still because the Federal Reserve has really not made any final decisions about what kind of operating framework we want to have over the longer-term. You can have an operating framework, there's really sort of two broad choices, one where there's just a tiny amount of reserves in the banking system.\n\nThat's what we used prior to the financial crisis. Or a regime, which is called a floor system, where there is quite a bit more reserves in the banking system so the balance sheet would be larger as a consequence.\n\nThe first thing is we have to make that decision, are we going to go back to the old regime where it's just a small amount of reserves in the banking system, or are we going to actually continue with a floor system?\n\nMy own personal view as someone who actually ran the Open Market Desk during the Financial Crisis is I very much favor retaining a floor system, so that would imply more excess reserves in the banking system, and a somewhat bigger balance sheet.\n\nSo, that's the first issue.\n\nThe second issue is we really don't know how much excess reserves we need in the banking system for a floor system to operate efficiently without a lot of day-to-day intervention. Presumably, if we move to a floor system over the longer-term, we're going to want to have enough excess reserves in the banking system, so we don't have to intervene on a day-by-day basis.\n\nIf you have to intervene on a day-by-day basis, you're sort of undermining the whole advantage of operating a floor system.\n\nSo, I think at the end of the day, we're going to sort of learn about how much reserves we're going to need in the -- we're going to make a decision about whether it's going to be a floor system or a recorder system. And then if we decide on a floor system, we're going to learn about how much excess reserves we actually need.\n\nMy own view is, if I had to say today, we're probably going to see a balance sheet five years from now that's probably in the order of 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 trillion rather than the 4-1/2 trillion dollar balance sheet.\n\nBut that's just a rough guess. It depends on a lot of different factors, like how fast does currency grow over the next 5 years.\n\nSo, I think the main point I would want to make about the size of the balance sheet, we're not going back to 800 billion. That's really the thing to underscore. But there's quite a bit of uncertainty about where we're going to actually end up at this point.\n\nQ: You feel good though in this process, that we're not going to have a repeat of 2013, a Taper Tantrum, where we -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I hope so. I mean we've been trying to do this in a way -- being very sensitive to that experience. So making sure that we're gradually educating people about how this balance sheet normalization process works. We're doing it -- we're phasing down the reinvestment at a gradual pace. So the First Quarter when we actually implement this program, only 6 billion of Treasury securities will run off each month. Only 4 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities. And then it gradually phases up over the next three quarters.\n\nSo, all these things are done in part to make sure that there's not a large financial statement reaction, and the fact that so far as we've rolled this out, the markets have responded quite benignly makes me confident that we can avoid the kind of Taper Tantrum that we saw in 2013.\n\nQ: We're at a point now looking at a major amount of change in the makeup of the Federal Reserve Board, and also the Regional Presidents for that matter. A lot of new faces coming on.\n\nIs there a concern that with that much changeover -- I mean you've got three openings now. You could have two more next year possibly. You've got four Regional Fed Presidents who've been there less than 2 years, and likely more. Can the Federal Reserve system -- how is it going to handle all of this change?\n\nDUDLEY: It's not something that I have a great concern about because the mission doesn't change. So Congress has set for the Federal Reserve the dual mandate, responsibilities of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. And we define price stability as 2% inflation.\n\nSo anybody coming onto the Fed -- the mission, that's the mission. And that doesn't change.\n\nThe second thing I would say is that the committee really does have a very strong consensus currently, in terms of what it wants to do going forward. The fact that the addendum to the balance sheet -- to the normalization plans -- was supported by every FOMC participant suggests that there's really strong support for the direction that the Federal Reserve is moving.\n\nAnd lastly, I expect that the new people will be very capable people, and I think they're going to make decisions in a way, very consistent with what we've been doing in recent years.\n\nSo this is not something that I'm concerned about it.\n\nQ: More specifically, President Trump of course has ... the 5 board members he could be appointing within now to the next 10 to 12 months. Given the President's style of seeming to prefer loyalty among appointees that he makes to all sorts of federal positions, does it concern you that the Fed's independence, especially the Board's, could be imperiled in any way by the people he puts in there, and the expectations he has for them?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is ultimately a creature of Congress, and Congress sets the mandate for the Fed, and I think the Fed needs then to be evaluated vis-a-vis that mandate.\n\nAnd so I think anybody coming in is going to feel this is my job, to try to achieve these dual mandate objectives.\n\nThe second thing I would say is the Trump Administration has been very hands-off in terms of the Fed. So, I think they've been very respectful of the monetary policy, not to politicize the monetary policy process. And that's continuing a very long tradition that's been place for going back, really, 25 years to the Clinton Administration, when Bob Rubin was the head of the National Economic Council in the Clinton Administration.\n\nI think we've actually seen a very consistent process of how the administration treats the Fed that's very -- I don't see any meaningful change from what we saw under the Obama Administration or prior administrations.\n\nQ: The Republicans in Congress though have really been pushing in monetary policy a rules-based system. Some of the candidates -- John Taylor -- has rules. Will that change how you set monetary policy? Would you have those kinds of folks coming on?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, you know, it's a committee, and so there's lots of people on the committee. We'll have to see how it all evolves. My own view is, I've been very clear on record that I'm not in favor of a mechanical use of a monetary policy rule.\n\nI think monetary policy rules are useful, as guides, as an input to the monetary policy-setting process. But mechanically using a monetary policy rule I think could lead to pretty significant mistakes in terms of monetary policy.\n\nAnd the example I like to use is what was the Taylor rule calling for in September 2008, when we met in terms of monetary policy? Well, it was saying that the Federal Funds Rate needed to rise significantly in the Fourth Quarter of 2008, which obviously would have been a disaster because the economy was in free-fall.\n\nThe problem with these mechanical rules is they don't really incorporate all the information that's relevant to the monetary policy setting process.\n\nSo, at the September 2008 meeting, Lehman Brothers had just failed. Clearly, this was going to have pretty significant effects on the financial system as we saw. And the U.S. economy was entering a pretty deep recession. This was not the time to be raising interest rates. So, I think the rules are fine as a guide to policy, as an input of policy, and if you look at the documents that accompanied the FOMC meetings that are part of the historical record, you'll see that various monetary policy rules are part of our deliberations. Just don't force us to use them mechanically.\n\nQ: In the area of bank regulation, President Trump was very critical of Dodd-Frank. Republicans in Congress are trying to change it. Do you expect more changes there in how the Fed regulates the banks?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that we -- there are some changes to Dodd-Frank that would be completely appropriate. I've been on record, and other Fed officials have been on record, as arguing for relief for smaller banking institutions. Smaller banking institutions don't create systemic risks to the financial system, so I think they can be treated differently than large banking institutions.\n\nSo, that's certainly something that I think could be done. I think the Volcker Rule could probably be implemented in a way that made it less of a burden for banking firms. The Volcker Rule actually applies to very small banks, which makes very little sense to me.\n\nBut it's important also not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The increase in capital requirements and liquidity requirements I think was very important. We need to keep that. The stress test that the Federal Reserve conducts on banks in order to stress their capital levels, I think is very, very important to retain.\n\nI think that some of the things in the Dodd-Frank Act, like the ability to resolve large systemic institutions without that threatening the rest of the financial system, very, very important that we retain that.\n\nThere is legislation that's been proposed in the House that would eliminate Title 2 of the Dodd-Frank Act. This is the Title that basically says that the FDIC can convert the firm to a new company by converting debt into equity. If you get rid of that, you need something in its place.\n\nMy view is that if a large firm were to get into difficulty and fail, you need 2 things. You need to be able to resolve it over a weekend and you need a source of liquidity on Monday morning because people will run from that institution.\n\nIf you don't have that, you will have a financial crisis that spreads, that has significant contagion. So, you can fix Dodd-Frank in a lot of ways. But it's really important to have the ability to resolve large institutions over the weekend and have a source of liquidity so that when businesses and households run from that troubled institution, there's a source of funding so that entity can be recapitalized and continue to go on.\n\nQ: On a personal level, Gary Cohn has been mentioned as potentially a Fed Chair if Yellen were not to be reappointed or declined. Did you work with Gary Cohn at Goldman Sachs? What is your impression of him as a potential Federal Reserve Chair?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't want to evaluate the various candidates for the Federal Reserve, except to say that I think Gary is a reasonable candidate. He knows a lot about financial markets. He knows lots about the financial system. I don't think you have to have a PhD in Economics, which I have, to be a Chair of the Fed or Governor or a President of one of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nI think it's important to have a committee that has diversity. That has different backgrounds and perspectives. So I think Gary's a reasonable candidate.\n\nQ: Not going to go there. One of the things that has been discussed is the income inequality. It's gotten to be such a problem. Should the Fed accept some responsibility for the widening in income inequality, just by how they've handled rates and the fact that the wealthy who own stocks and other assets have benefited very well?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think monetary policy really isn't a tool that's well-suited to address issues of income inequality or income mobility. There's a whole other set of tools I think that can address those type of issues. Tax policy, education policy, access to opportunities. I just think it's sort of outside the Fed's purview.\n\nObviously, we care deeply about income inequality and income mobility, and I've been talking about it on a regular basis.\n\nI actually think that the income mobility issue is probably just as important -- or maybe even more important -- than the income inequality issue because I can understand why someone just starting out in their career gets paid less than someone who has a lot more experience and brings a lot more value to a firm.\n\nI understand that kind of income inequality. What I find a lot harder to justify is the fact that a lot of research has shown that where you're born, literally the physical location of where you're born, affects your ability to move up the income mobility scale over time, which seems extraordinarily unfair to me.\n\nSo, we've been putting a lot of emphasis at the bank on really trying to understand the issues of income mobility and trying to raise this issue in terms of people's consciousness. And try to develop more of a dialogue about what we could actually do about it, which I think is job training, it's access to opportunities.\n\nSome of the cities that we travel to around the Second District, there are jobs available in the suburbs, and the people in the inner city can't get to those jobs. So, sometimes it's just things simple like transportation. The ability of people to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\nI think that not providing people with opportunities I think is bad.\n\nQ: Who's to blame for this then?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we've just -- I think there hasn't been enough focus on the consequences of globalization, which I think have left people behind. And I think there hasn't been enough focus on trying to improve the opportunities for all Americans, not just some Americans.\n\nSo, that's what I'd like to see happen in the coming years.\n\nQ: We're in an unusual policy mix at the moment. You've got North Korea. Very big threat there. A variety of issues going on. Is this a hard time for Fed policymakers in particular, just because of the seeming gridlock in Washington and the heightened rhetoric that's out and about?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think this is a particularly tough time. I certainly would rather be here than back in 2007, 2008. If you look at where we are, the economy is growing above trend, the unemployment rate is at 4.3%. Inflation is a little bit below our target, but not a lot below our target, so we're not missing our inflation objective by a huge margin.\n\nIf you look at what economists call the so-called Misery Index, the sum of inflation plus unemployment, we're probably at one of the best places we've been at for the last 50 years.\n\nSo, if we could just stay here -- (LAUGHS) -- and emulate Australia which is in their 26th year of economic expansion, that would be great.\n\nI think this is a good place to be, and I'm hoping that we can just act in a way to sustain this economic expansion so it can benefit a broader set of Americans.\n\nQ: We're in the third longest, now in our 9th year -- 10 years has been the maximum. When does the next recession happen?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think that economic expansions die from old age. I think they die because either the economy is hit with a very adverse shock. Oftentimes those are very difficult to anticipate. Or because inflation gets out of hand and the Federal Reserve has to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation under control.\n\nClearly, we don't have that latter problem right now. The Fed has no reason in my view to act aggressively to tighten monetary policy. If you look at what we've done, we've been very, very gentle in terms of how we've been removing monetary policy accommodation.\n\nAnd as long as inflation stays low, I think that's going to continue. So, certainly, there is very little risk to the expansion coming from the Fed.\n\nYou could also look at the economy. It seems to be in pretty good balance. The household sector I think is well-supported by rising wages and strong job growth and a good balance sheet.\n\nI think that the international outlook has improved, and the dollar has weakened, and I think that provides support to business fixed investment spending and the country's trade performance.\n\nSo, yes, it's a pretty long-lived expansion but I don't really see things on the horizon. Knock on wood.\n\nQ: You see no bubbles of any assets? Because that ultimately is what --\n\nDUDLEY: I mean that's too strong. I mean I think there are areas where you could sort of say, boy, asset prices might be somewhat overvalued in certain areas. But this is totally different than -- not 2007. The housing market was up dramatically. It's a hugely big market in terms of dollar value.\n\nSo when that started to unwind, the amount of stress that it put on the financial system was severe, and we had a much more fragile financial system at the time.\n\nI think we're in a very different place than we were then.\n\nDUDLEY: Well, productivity growth is the key driver. I mean Real GDP growth is really the sum of how much labor input you have, plus how much productivity is increasing per an hour worked. So the way to get growth -- in the labor force, growth rate is really driven by demographics and immigration policy.\n\nSo, the labor force is not growing that fast. The only way you're going to get to a higher growth rate is by raising the productivity growth rate. And we'll see. Obviously, to the extent that you have some regulatory relief, that will probably push you in the right direction. It's possible that there could be new technological discoveries and dissemination of those technologies that can raise productivity growth over time.\n\nBut it's really productivity growth that we need to be focused on if we're going to try to get to a higher sustainable Real GDP growth rate.\n\nQ: So, at the moment, no change in the Fed long term forecast?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean we've had a period of years where productivity growth has disappointed. The last year it's a little bit better. We're above 1% over the last four quarters, so we'll see.\n\nI mean this is very difficult to forecast. Obviously I would hope for higher productivity growth rather than lower productivity growth because that would boost people's standards of livings. Their real incomes would rise over time.\n\nSo, I'm in favor of Congress and the Administration, and state and local governments, doing things that raise productivity growth.

Could you tell us, are you lowering it now, that his program is -- your own personal forecast -- are you lowering it given that his economic program is at the moment stalled? Any comments?\n\nWILLIAM DUDLEY: My outlook for the economy hasn't changed materially since the beginning of the year. Continue to look for growths around 2%, slightly above trend, growth sufficient to continue to tighten the labor market. I did not raise my growth forecast after the Election because of the prospect of fiscal stimulus because I felt that there was a lot of uncertainty about how big it would be, what its composition would be, and when it would actually take effect.\n\nFILE - In this May 20, 2014, file photo, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley is interviewed by Peter Barnes on the Fox Business Network, in New York. In an interview with The Associated Press, Dudley indicated that the Fed will likely make an announcement at its September 2017 meeting that it is ready to start reducing its massive bond portfolio, a move expected to put upward pressure on long-term interest rates including home mortgages. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\n\nSo, I always viewed it as a risk to the forecast. In other words, an upside risk to the forecast, but I never put it into my baseline forecast.\n\nI think we're still on the same trajectory we've been on for several years. Above trend growth, gradually tightening labor market, inflation -- somewhat below our objective -- but we do expect as the labor market continues to tighten, to see firmer wage gains and that will ultimately filter into inflation moving up towards our 2% objective.\n\nQ: What do you see as the evidence for the labor market tightening?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think you can see it just directly in the unemployment rate, 4.3%, that's the lowest unemployment rate we've had in many years. If you look at some of the broader measures of unemployment, they have also come down to levels that we reached prior to the great recession. So, a pretty broad range of evidence that suggests the labor market is quite a bit tighter than it's been in many years. Which is a good thing.\n\nQ: Sure. In an appearance last week you said that the inflation that you look at might not get back up to 2% for 6 to 10 months, just given ... Given that outlook, why be thinking of raising rates at all?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, the reason why inflation won't get up to 2% very quickly on a year-over-year basis is because we've had these very low inflation readings over the last 4 or 5 months. So it's going to take time for those to sort of drop out of the year-over-year calculation.\n\nBut I think if you look at inflation sequentially, in other words what's inflation likely to actually do over the next 6 months, I'm expecting somewhat higher readings than what we've had over the last 6 months.\n\nNow the reason why I think you'd want to continue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation, even with inflation somewhat below target, is that 1) monetary policy is still accommodative, so the level of short-term rates is pretty low, and 2) and this is probably even more important, financial conditions have been easing rather than tightening. So despite the fact that we've raised short-term interest rates, financial conditions are easier today than they were a year ago.\n\nThe stock market's up, credit spreads have narrowed, the dollar has weakened, and those have more than offset the effects of somewhat higher short-term rates and the very modest increases that we've seen in longer-term yields.\n\nQ: The markets right now are putting about a 50-50 odds of even a rate hike as late as December. Is it likely that 2 may be it for this year?\n\nDUDLEY: I think it depends on how the economic forecast evolves. If it evolves in line with my expectations, I would expect -- I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\n\nQ: Speaking a little more broadly about the issue of inflation, as you know of course there's a school of thought that says that we are in an environment where low inflation may persist far longer than anybody expects. One, it's not just domestically but globally as well.\n\nNobody knows, of course, whether that's correct or not. But we obviously do see very, very low inflation globally. Forecasts, including the Fed's own forecasts of inflation going back 2, 3, 4 years have consistently proved below what turned out to be reality.\n\nHow do you wrestle, or how do you reconcile the Fed's plans or policymaking with the idea that we may be in a long-term environment. Or, an environment of long-term persistently low inflation, and that perhaps the Fed should walk away from a 2% target? Or adjust it, or just in some ways, come to grips with the reality, or the potential reality, that we're in a very, very low inflation environment going forward for a long time?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think there's a fundamental question about whether are we in a new regime or is it just going to take some time for the inflation to move higher? There are long lags between getting to a tight labor market and that actually showing up in higher wages, and those wages then pushing into inflation.\n\nSo, I think the jury's out of whether there is sort of structural, secular changes in place that are holding inflation lower on a sustained basis.\n\nI mean one can identify some reasons for thinking that that could continue the ability for consumers and businesses to see what the prices of goods and services are broadly across a wide range of people selling goods and services is very, very good.\n\nThe distribution methods of how goods and services are provided have changed pretty dramatically. So this -- and I think that's probably eroding pricing power and brand loyalty. It's possible that that could be putting downward pressure on inflation.\n\nBut if that's the case, that's not really a bad thing. That means we can actually allow the economy to operate at a higher level potentially of resource utilization.\n\nIf it's true that inflation is going to be lower on a secular basis, that should allow us to continue to let the economy run a little bit longer. And continue to have above-trend job gains and to see the unemployment rate even move a little bit lower.\n\nSo, I think the jury is out, whether this lags or is just going to take some time for it to show through, or whether we're in a different regime.\n\nI think the next 4 to 6 months I think are going to be important to see whether the readings that we've had over the last few months are mainly due to one-off factors, such as the big decline that we've seen in cellphone prices, or whether there's something more fundamental going on.\n\nQ: Would you entertain at least the possibility that the Fed might at some point just have to suspend its rate increases, just to deal with the reality that rates remain persistently low?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that if the economy continues to grow above trend, and the labor market continues to tighten, I do think we'll get to the point where that will lead to higher wages and that will show up in terms of higher inflation.\n\nNow, the question is at what level of the unemployment rate will that all take place? So, if there are these secular forces that are pushing inflation lower, perhaps we can actually go to a somewhat lower unemployment rate. I would actually view -- rather than people wringing their hands that this is so awful that inflation is low, it actually might be a good thing because it could allow you to run the economy at a little bit higher level of resource utilization, which I think ... people get employed, they get job skills, they'd be able to build their human capital over time. (00:07:29) The productive capacity of the U.S. economy would be greater -- all those things would be good things.\n\nWhat we have to do, though, to discern is, what we see on inflation, is this temporary or is this something that's going to be more persistent?\n\nQ: You feel the jury is out on that?\n\nDUDLEY: I think the jury is out on that.\n\nQ: Given this nine-year period of very low rates, it has spawned talk about asset bubbles. Stock prices are record levels. Bond prices are up. Alan Greenspan said the bond market is going to collapse as you raise rates. Are you concerned about asset bubbles?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean obviously, we need to continue to always look at the financial system to see whether there are misaligned asset prices that are misaligned relative to the fundamentals because if the asset prices were to move sharply, that would presumably create quite a bit of stress on the financial system.\n\nThen the question is could the financial system withstand that stress? So, this is something we do look at on a regular basis.\n\nMy own view is that -- I'm not particularly concerned about where our asset prices are today for a couple of reasons. The main one is that I think that the asset prices are pretty consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy.\n\nThe economy has been evolving in a very low volatility way, 2% growth a year, pretty steady. Inflation has stayed low. There is not much volatility in the economy, and I think that's translated to low volatility in financial asset markets, and that's actually helped lift valuations.\n\nNow obviously this means that if the economic outlook changed, if we got a lot more volatility in terms of the economy, then that could potentially prove problematic for financial markets.\n\nBut right now, it seems to me like the financial statements are behaving in a way that's consistent with the economic environment that we're seeing. If the financial statements were behaving in a way inconsistent with the economic environment that we've been seeing, I'd be much more concerned.\n\nQ: Of course speaking just to that question here, there is some concern that the Fed's accommodative rates, although they've come up somewhat, it's still so accommodative that -- and bond yields are so low, that obviously investors are pouring more and more money into equities because that's where the returns are.\n\nAnd so the concern is that those equity prices don't necessarily just reflect the economic fundamentals, but of course, reflect people. As bubbles form, people put things in assets they feel are going to continue to keep going up because the other options are not as appealing. Is that a concern?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we're going to continue to review what we're seeing in terms of asset prices. The other positive, too, I think though is that if asset prices go down, what's the consequence of that for the stability of the financial system? Well, I think the financial system is a much, much stronger place today than it was prior to the financial crisis and the Great Recession. Banks have more capital, they have more liquidity while we've corrected I think some of the structural weaknesses in the financial system.\n\nI don't think it's reasonable to think that the Federal Reserve is somehow going to manage financial asset prices so that they are completely stable over time. They are going to go up and down, depending on the economic environment.\n\nWhat we have to be cautious of is making sure that the financial system is robust, so that if there is weakness in financial asset prices, it doesn't contribute to a great stress in the financial system, which then spills into the real economy, to try to avoid what happened during the Great Recession.\n\nQ: There's a widely-held view in financial markets that come September, the Fed will announce that it's starting to trim its balance sheet. Is that view correct?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, we obviously have to have the FOMC meeting to make that decision at the next FOMC meeting. But, I don't think the expectations of market participants are unreasonable. In June, following the June FOMC meeting, we laid out a plan in terms of how we would actually do our balance sheet normalization. How we would allow Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to gradually run off our portfolio over time.\n\nAnd so the plan is out there. It's been I think generally well-received, and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place. In the last FOMC statement, we said that we expected this to happen relatively soon. So, I expect it to happen relatively soon.\n\nQ: And how -- just in a process -- the announcement would come in September, you've got things like the debt ceiling, all of that. Would you expect the actual implementation in October, or would that be delayed? How would that process work?\n\nDUDLEY: First of all, we haven't made any decision yet about whether we're actually going to start in September. So, if we were to start in September, does a debt limit ceiling discussion -- debate -- create difficulties for us? I would say not really, in the sense that the debt that we hold counts against the debt limit, just like the debt held by the private sector.\n\nIn some ways, we're really not part of the -- it doesn't affect -- whether we start or don't start doesn't have really any effect about when the debt limit will actually be binding.\n\nAnd second of all, we can obviously announce the start of the program but delay the actual start date. So I think that -- I don't think the debt limit will have big impact on our decision about whether to start or not start the balance sheet normalization process.\n\nQ: On the issue of the balance sheet, you've suggested that reduction in the balance sheet can affect asset prices differently from an increase in the Funds Rate. Could you speak a little bit about what kind of consequences people can expect -- ordinary people, ordinary businesses -- from the gradual reduction of the balance sheet?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, we need to be somewhat humble about what we know about this because we've never done this before. And that's why I think we've been very, very careful in terms of how we've gradually rolled this out, so that people can see how we're planning to do this.\n\nIt's one of the reasons why the reinvestment process, phasing that down, is going to happen very gradually, that we're not just going to stop abruptly because we want to make sure that the adjustments are small, the model is gentle, and don't have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nSo far I would say that the market reaction has been extraordinarily mild. As expectations have gone from relatively low probability that we're going to start this to a very high probability that we're going to start this relatively soon. And so that makes me more confident that when we start, it's not going to have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nFinally what I would expect is over time, as the Federal Reserve allows its portfolio to run down, that means the private sector has to absorb somewhat larger amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, that will probably put some modest upward pressure on long-term yields.\n\nBut I wouldn't expect it to be very large for a number of reasons. One, it's already anticipated that this is going to happen. And 2) the balance sheet is going to shrink, but we're not going back to where we were in 2007, when the balance sheet was 800 billion.\n\nSo, the shrinkage of the balance sheet is going to be a lot smaller than the increase in the balance sheet that happened before.\n\nQ: ... mortgage rates or business loans. You feel like the economy can absorb that?\n\nDUDLEY: Yes, yes. I mean right now, long-term rates are very, very low. If you had asked me a few years ago could the U.S. economy get to a 4.3% unemployment rate and the Federal Reserve was gradually tightening monetary policy, and 10-year Treasury yields would be 2-1/4%, I would have been quite surprised. (LAUGHTER)\n\nQ: On the balance sheet, Chair Yellen has talked a little bit in her testimony about where it could end up. It's not going to go back to 800 billion, pre-Crisis. Where do you think it might end up?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think that's quite uncertain still because the Federal Reserve has really not made any final decisions about what kind of operating framework we want to have over the longer-term. You can have an operating framework, there's really sort of two broad choices, one where there's just a tiny amount of reserves in the banking system.\n\nThat's what we used prior to the financial crisis. Or a regime, which is called a floor system, where there is quite a bit more reserves in the banking system so the balance sheet would be larger as a consequence.\n\nThe first thing is we have to make that decision, are we going to go back to the old regime where it's just a small amount of reserves in the banking system, or are we going to actually continue with a floor system?\n\nMy own personal view as someone who actually ran the Open Market Desk during the Financial Crisis is I very much favor retaining a floor system, so that would imply more excess reserves in the banking system, and a somewhat bigger balance sheet.\n\nSo, that's the first issue.\n\nThe second issue is we really don't know how much excess reserves we need in the banking system for a floor system to operate efficiently without a lot of day-to-day intervention. Presumably, if we move to a floor system over the longer-term, we're going to want to have enough excess reserves in the banking system, so we don't have to intervene on a day-by-day basis.\n\nIf you have to intervene on a day-by-day basis, you're sort of undermining the whole advantage of operating a floor system.\n\nSo, I think at the end of the day, we're going to sort of learn about how much reserves we're going to need in the -- we're going to make a decision about whether it's going to be a floor system or a recorder system. And then if we decide on a floor system, we're going to learn about how much excess reserves we actually need.\n\nMy own view is, if I had to say today, we're probably going to see a balance sheet five years from now that's probably in the order of 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 trillion rather than the 4-1/2 trillion dollar balance sheet.\n\nBut that's just a rough guess. It depends on a lot of different factors, like how fast does currency grow over the next 5 years.\n\nSo, I think the main point I would want to make about the size of the balance sheet, we're not going back to 800 billion. That's really the thing to underscore. But there's quite a bit of uncertainty about where we're going to actually end up at this point.\n\nQ: You feel good though in this process, that we're not going to have a repeat of 2013, a Taper Tantrum, where we -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I hope so. I mean we've been trying to do this in a way -- being very sensitive to that experience. So making sure that we're gradually educating people about how this balance sheet normalization process works. We're doing it -- we're phasing down the reinvestment at a gradual pace. So the First Quarter when we actually implement this program, only 6 billion of Treasury securities will run off each month. Only 4 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities. And then it gradually phases up over the next three quarters.\n\nSo, all these things are done in part to make sure that there's not a large financial statement reaction, and the fact that so far as we've rolled this out, the markets have responded quite benignly makes me confident that we can avoid the kind of Taper Tantrum that we saw in 2013.\n\nQ: We're at a point now looking at a major amount of change in the makeup of the Federal Reserve Board, and also the Regional Presidents for that matter. A lot of new faces coming on.\n\nIs there a concern that with that much changeover -- I mean you've got three openings now. You could have two more next year possibly. You've got four Regional Fed Presidents who've been there less than 2 years, and likely more. Can the Federal Reserve system -- how is it going to handle all of this change?\n\nDUDLEY: It's not something that I have a great concern about because the mission doesn't change. So Congress has set for the Federal Reserve the dual mandate, responsibilities of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. And we define price stability as 2% inflation.\n\nSo anybody coming onto the Fed -- the mission, that's the mission. And that doesn't change.\n\nThe second thing I would say is that the committee really does have a very strong consensus currently, in terms of what it wants to do going forward. The fact that the addendum to the balance sheet -- to the normalization plans -- was supported by every FOMC participant suggests that there's really strong support for the direction that the Federal Reserve is moving.\n\nAnd lastly, I expect that the new people will be very capable people, and I think they're going to make decisions in a way, very consistent with what we've been doing in recent years.\n\nSo this is not something that I'm concerned about it.\n\nQ: More specifically, President Trump of course has ... the 5 board members he could be appointing within now to the next 10 to 12 months. Given the President's style of seeming to prefer loyalty among appointees that he makes to all sorts of federal positions, does it concern you that the Fed's independence, especially the Board's, could be imperiled in any way by the people he puts in there, and the expectations he has for them?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is ultimately a creature of Congress, and Congress sets the mandate for the Fed, and I think the Fed needs then to be evaluated vis-a-vis that mandate.\n\nAnd so I think anybody coming in is going to feel this is my job, to try to achieve these dual mandate objectives.\n\nThe second thing I would say is the Trump Administration has been very hands-off in terms of the Fed. So, I think they've been very respectful of the monetary policy, not to politicize the monetary policy process. And that's continuing a very long tradition that's been place for going back, really, 25 years to the Clinton Administration, when Bob Rubin was the head of the National Economic Council in the Clinton Administration.\n\nI think we've actually seen a very consistent process of how the administration treats the Fed that's very -- I don't see any meaningful change from what we saw under the Obama Administration or prior administrations.\n\nQ: The Republicans in Congress though have really been pushing in monetary policy a rules-based system. Some of the candidates -- John Taylor -- has rules. Will that change how you set monetary policy? Would you have those kinds of folks coming on?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, you know, it's a committee, and so there's lots of people on the committee. We'll have to see how it all evolves. My own view is, I've been very clear on record that I'm not in favor of a mechanical use of a monetary policy rule.\n\nI think monetary policy rules are useful, as guides, as an input to the monetary policy-setting process. But mechanically using a monetary policy rule I think could lead to pretty significant mistakes in terms of monetary policy.\n\nAnd the example I like to use is what was the Taylor rule calling for in September 2008, when we met in terms of monetary policy? Well, it was saying that the Federal Funds Rate needed to rise significantly in the Fourth Quarter of 2008, which obviously would have been a disaster because the economy was in free-fall.\n\nThe problem with these mechanical rules is they don't really incorporate all the information that's relevant to the monetary policy setting process.\n\nSo, at the September 2008 meeting, Lehman Brothers had just failed. Clearly, this was going to have pretty significant effects on the financial system as we saw. And the U.S. economy was entering a pretty deep recession. This was not the time to be raising interest rates. So, I think the rules are fine as a guide to policy, as an input of policy, and if you look at the documents that accompanied the FOMC meetings that are part of the historical record, you'll see that various monetary policy rules are part of our deliberations. Just don't force us to use them mechanically.\n\nQ: In the area of bank regulation, President Trump was very critical of Dodd-Frank. Republicans in Congress are trying to change it. Do you expect more changes there in how the Fed regulates the banks?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that we -- there are some changes to Dodd-Frank that would be completely appropriate. I've been on record, and other Fed officials have been on record, as arguing for relief for smaller banking institutions. Smaller banking institutions don't create systemic risks to the financial system, so I think they can be treated differently than large banking institutions.\n\nSo, that's certainly something that I think could be done. I think the Volcker Rule could probably be implemented in a way that made it less of a burden for banking firms. The Volcker Rule actually applies to very small banks, which makes very little sense to me.\n\nBut it's important also not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The increase in capital requirements and liquidity requirements I think was very important. We need to keep that. The stress test that the Federal Reserve conducts on banks in order to stress their capital levels, I think is very, very important to retain.\n\nI think that some of the things in the Dodd-Frank Act, like the ability to resolve large systemic institutions without that threatening the rest of the financial system, very, very important that we retain that.\n\nThere is legislation that's been proposed in the House that would eliminate Title 2 of the Dodd-Frank Act. This is the Title that basically says that the FDIC can convert the firm to a new company by converting debt into equity. If you get rid of that, you need something in its place.\n\nMy view is that if a large firm were to get into difficulty and fail, you need 2 things. You need to be able to resolve it over a weekend and you need a source of liquidity on Monday morning because people will run from that institution.\n\nIf you don't have that, you will have a financial crisis that spreads, that has significant contagion. So, you can fix Dodd-Frank in a lot of ways. But it's really important to have the ability to resolve large institutions over the weekend and have a source of liquidity so that when businesses and households run from that troubled institution, there's a source of funding so that entity can be recapitalized and continue to go on.\n\nQ: On a personal level, Gary Cohn has been mentioned as potentially a Fed Chair if Yellen were not to be reappointed or declined. Did you work with Gary Cohn at Goldman Sachs? What is your impression of him as a potential Federal Reserve Chair?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't want to evaluate the various candidates for the Federal Reserve, except to say that I think Gary is a reasonable candidate. He knows a lot about financial markets. He knows lots about the financial system. I don't think you have to have a PhD in Economics, which I have, to be a Chair of the Fed or Governor or a President of one of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nI think it's important to have a committee that has diversity. That has different backgrounds and perspectives. So I think Gary's a reasonable candidate.\n\nQ: Any others you want to -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nQ: -- names you'd mention -- any -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: No, no thanks.\n\nQ: Not going to go there. One of the things that has been discussed is the income inequality. It's gotten to be such a problem. Should the Fed accept some responsibility for the widening in income inequality, just by how they've handled rates and the fact that the wealthy who own stocks and other assets have benefited very well?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think monetary policy really isn't a tool that's well-suited to address issues of income inequality or income mobility. There's a whole other set of tools I think that can address those type of issues. Tax policy, education policy, access to opportunities. I just think it's sort of outside the Fed's purview.\n\nObviously, we care deeply about income inequality and income mobility, and I've been talking about it on a regular basis.\n\nI actually think that the income mobility issue is probably just as important -- or maybe even more important -- than the income inequality issue because I can understand why someone just starting out in their career gets paid less than someone who has a lot more experience and brings a lot more value to a firm.\n\nI understand that kind of income inequality. What I find a lot harder to justify is the fact that a lot of research has shown that where you're born, literally the physical location of where you're born, affects your ability to move up the income mobility scale over time, which seems extraordinarily unfair to me.\n\nSo, we've been putting a lot of emphasis at the bank on really trying to understand the issues of income mobility and trying to raise this issue in terms of people's consciousness. And try to develop more of a dialogue about what we could actually do about it, which I think is job training, it's access to opportunities.\n\nSome of the cities that we travel to around the Second District, there are jobs available in the suburbs, and the people in the inner city can't get to those jobs. So, sometimes it's just things simple like transportation. The ability of people to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\nI think that not providing people with opportunities I think is bad.\n\nQ: Who's to blame for this then?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we've just -- I think there hasn't been enough focus on the consequences of globalization, which I think have left people behind. And I think there hasn't been enough focus on trying to improve the opportunities for all Americans, not just some Americans.\n\nSo, that's what I'd like to see happen in the coming years.\n\nQ: We're in an unusual policy mix at the moment. You've got North Korea. Very big threat there. A variety of issues going on. Is this a hard time for Fed policymakers in particular, just because of the seeming gridlock in Washington and the heightened rhetoric that's out and about?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think this is a particularly tough time. I certainly would rather be here than back in 2007, 2008. If you look at where we are, the economy is growing above trend, the unemployment rate is at 4.3%. Inflation is a little bit below our target, but not a lot below our target, so we're not missing our inflation objective by a huge margin.\n\nIf you look at what economists call the so-called Misery Index, the sum of inflation plus unemployment, we're probably at one of the best places we've been at for the last 50 years.\n\nSo, if we could just stay here -- (LAUGHS) -- and emulate Australia which is in their 26th year of economic expansion, that would be great.\n\nI think this is a good place to be, and I'm hoping that we can just act in a way to sustain this economic expansion so it can benefit a broader set of Americans.\n\nQ: We're in the third longest, now in our 9th year -- 10 years has been the maximum. When does the next recession happen?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think that economic expansions die from old age. I think they die because either the economy is hit with a very adverse shock. Oftentimes those are very difficult to anticipate. Or because inflation gets out of hand and the Federal Reserve has to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation under control.\n\nClearly, we don't have that latter problem right now. The Fed has no reason in my view to act aggressively to tighten monetary policy. If you look at what we've done, we've been very, very gentle in terms of how we've been removing monetary policy accommodation.\n\nAnd as long as inflation stays low, I think that's going to continue. So, certainly, there is very little risk to the expansion coming from the Fed.\n\nYou could also look at the economy. It seems to be in pretty good balance. The household sector I think is well-supported by rising wages and strong job growth and a good balance sheet.\n\nI think that the international outlook has improved, and the dollar has weakened, and I think that provides support to business fixed investment spending and the country's trade performance.\n\nSo, yes, it's a pretty long-lived expansion but I don't really see things on the horizon. Knock on wood.\n\n(AUDIO LOST BRIEFLY - (00:32:43))\n\n-- recession is imminent.\n\nQ: You see no bubbles of any assets? Because that ultimately is what --\n\nDUDLEY: I mean that's too strong. I mean I think there are areas where you could sort of say, boy, asset prices might be somewhat overvalued in certain areas. But this is totally different than -- not 2007. The housing market was up dramatically. It's a hugely big market in terms of dollar value.\n\nSo when that started to unwind, the amount of stress that it put on the financial system was severe, and we had a much more fragile financial system at the time.\n\nI think we're in a very different place than we were then.\n\nQ: Just getting from 2% to 5%, 4%, 3% --\n\nDUDLEY: For growth?\n\nQ: GDP growth, yes.\n\nDUDLEY: Well, productivity growth is the key driver. I mean Real GDP growth is really the sum of how much labor input you have, plus how much productivity is increasing per an hour worked. So the way to get growth -- in the labor force, growth rate is really driven by demographics and immigration policy.\n\nSo, the labor force is not growing that fast. The only way you're going to get to a higher growth rate is by raising the productivity growth rate. And we'll see. Obviously, to the extent that you have some regulatory relief, that will probably push you in the right direction. It's possible that there could be new technological discoveries and dissemination of those technologies that can raise productivity growth over time.\n\nBut it's really productivity growth that we need to be focused on if we're going to try to get to a higher sustainable Real GDP growth rate.\n\nQ: So, at the moment, no change in the Fed long term forecast?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean we've had a period of years where productivity growth has disappointed. The last year it's a little bit better. We're above 1% over the last four quarters, so we'll see.\n\nI mean this is very difficult to forecast. Obviously I would hope for higher productivity growth rather than lower productivity growth because that would boost people's standards of livings. Their real incomes would rise over time.\n\nSo, I'm in favor of Congress and the Administration, and state and local governments, doing things that raise productivity growth. Part of it's giving people better job skills, better opportunities. Removing unnecessary regulatory burden, when that's appropriate.\n\nIf we can do those things, probably we can get productivity up a bit. But I think we have to be realistic about how little we know about our ability to forecast productivity on a going-forward basis.\n\nQ: Thank you very much.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [],

Could you tell us, are you lowering it now, that his program is -- your own personal forecast -- are you lowering it given that his economic program is at the moment stalled? Any comments?\n\nWILLIAM DUDLEY: My outlook for the economy hasn't changed materially since the beginning of the year. Continue to look for growths around 2%, slightly above trend, growth sufficient to continue to tighten the labor market. I did not raise my growth forecast after the Election because of the prospect of fiscal stimulus because I felt that there was a lot of uncertainty about how big it would be, what its composition would be, and when it would actually take effect.\n\nSo, I always viewed it as a risk to the forecast. In other words, an upside risk to the forecast, but I never put it into my baseline forecast.\n\nI think we're still on the same trajectory we've been on for several years. Above trend growth, gradually tightening labor market, inflation -- somewhat below our objective -- but we do expect as the labor market continues to tighten, to see firmer wage gains and that will ultimately filter into inflation moving up towards our 2% objective.\n\nQ: What do you see as the evidence for the labor market tightening?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think you can see it just directly in the unemployment rate, 4.3%, that's the lowest unemployment rate we've had in many years. If you look at some of the broader measures of unemployment, they have also come down to levels that we reached prior to the great recession. So, a pretty broad range of evidence that suggests the labor market is quite a bit tighter than it's been in many years. Which is a good thing.\n\nQ: Sure. In an appearance last week you said that the inflation that you look at might not get back up to 2% for 6 to 10 months, just given ... Given that outlook, why be thinking of raising rates at all?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, the reason why inflation won't get up to 2% very quickly on a year-over-year basis is because we've had these very low inflation readings over the last 4 or 5 months. So it's going to take time for those to sort of drop out of the year-over-year calculation.\n\nBut I think if you look at inflation sequentially, in other words what's inflation likely to actually do over the next 6 months, I'm expecting somewhat higher readings than what we've had over the last 6 months.\n\nNow the reason why I think you'd want to continue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation, even with inflation somewhat below target, is that 1) monetary policy is still accommodative, so the level of short-term rates is pretty low, and 2) and this is probably even more important, financial conditions have been easing rather than tightening. So despite the fact that we've raised short-term interest rates, financial conditions are easier today than they were a year ago.\n\nThe stock market's up, credit spreads have narrowed, the dollar has weakened, and those have more than offset the effects of somewhat higher short-term rates and the very modest increases that we've seen in longer-term yields.\n\nQ: The markets right now are putting about a 50-50 odds of even a rate hike as late as December. Is it likely that 2 may be it for this year?\n\nDUDLEY: I think it depends on how the economic forecast evolves. If it evolves in line with my expectations, I would expect -- I would be in favor of doing another rate hike later this year.\n\nQ: Speaking a little more broadly about the issue of inflation, as you know of course there's a school of thought that says that we are in an environment where low inflation may persist far longer than anybody expects. One, it's not just domestically but globally as well.\n\nNobody knows, of course, whether that's correct or not. But we obviously do see very, very low inflation globally. Forecasts, including the Fed's own forecasts of inflation going back 2, 3, 4 years have consistently proved below what turned out to be reality.\n\nHow do you wrestle, or how do you reconcile the Fed's plans or policymaking with the idea that we may be in a long-term environment. Or, an environment of long-term persistently low inflation, and that perhaps the Fed should walk away from a 2% target? Or adjust it, or just in some ways, come to grips with the reality, or the potential reality, that we're in a very, very low inflation environment going forward for a long time?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think there's a fundamental question about whether are we in a new regime or is it just going to take some time for the inflation to move higher? There are long lags between getting to a tight labor market and that actually showing up in higher wages, and those wages then pushing into inflation.\n\nSo, I think the jury's out of whether there is sort of structural, secular changes in place that are holding inflation lower on a sustained basis.\n\nI mean one can identify some reasons for thinking that that could continue the ability for consumers and businesses to see what the prices of goods and services are broadly across a wide range of people selling goods and services is very, very good.\n\nThe distribution methods of how goods and services are provided have changed pretty dramatically. So this -- and I think that's probably eroding pricing power and brand loyalty. It's possible that that could be putting downward pressure on inflation.\n\nBut if that's the case, that's not really a bad thing. That means we can actually allow the economy to operate at a higher level potentially of resource utilization.\n\nIf it's true that inflation is going to be lower on a secular basis, that should allow us to continue to let the economy run a little bit longer. And continue to have above-trend job gains and to see the unemployment rate even move a little bit lower.\n\nSo, I think the jury is out, whether this lags or is just going to take some time for it to show through, or whether we're in a different regime.\n\nI think the next 4 to 6 months I think are going to be important to see whether the readings that we've had over the last few months are mainly due to one-off factors, such as the big decline that we've seen in cellphone prices, or whether there's something more fundamental going on.\n\nQ: Would you entertain at least the possibility that the Fed might at some point just have to suspend its rate increases, just to deal with the reality that rates remain persistently low?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that if the economy continues to grow above trend, and the labor market continues to tighten, I do think we'll get to the point where that will lead to higher wages and that will show up in terms of higher inflation.\n\nNow, the question is at what level of the unemployment rate will that all take place? So, if there are these secular forces that are pushing inflation lower, perhaps we can actually go to a somewhat lower unemployment rate. I would actually view -- rather than people wringing their hands that this is so awful that inflation is low, it actually might be a good thing because it could allow you to run the economy at a little bit higher level of resource utilization, which I think ... people get employed, they get job skills, they'd be able to build their human capital over time. (00:07:29) The productive capacity of the U.S. economy would be greater -- all those things would be good things.\n\nWhat we have to do, though, to discern is, what we see on inflation, is this temporary or is this something that's going to be more persistent?\n\nQ: You feel the jury is out on that?\n\nDUDLEY: I think the jury is out on that.\n\nQ: Given this nine-year period of very low rates, it has spawned talk about asset bubbles. Stock prices are record levels. Bond prices are up. Alan Greenspan said the bond market is going to collapse as you raise rates. Are you concerned about asset bubbles?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean obviously, we need to continue to always look at the financial system to see whether there are misaligned asset prices that are misaligned relative to the fundamentals because if the asset prices were to move sharply, that would presumably create quite a bit of stress on the financial system.\n\nThen the question is could the financial system withstand that stress? So, this is something we do look at on a regular basis.\n\nMy own view is that -- I'm not particularly concerned about where our asset prices are today for a couple of reasons. The main one is that I think that the asset prices are pretty consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy.\n\nThe economy has been evolving in a very low volatility way, 2% growth a year, pretty steady. Inflation has stayed low. There is not much volatility in the economy, and I think that's translated to low volatility in financial asset markets, and that's actually helped lift valuations.\n\nNow obviously this means that if the economic outlook changed, if we got a lot more volatility in terms of the economy, then that could potentially prove problematic for financial markets.\n\nBut right now, it seems to me like the financial statements are behaving in a way that's consistent with the economic environment that we're seeing. If the financial statements were behaving in a way inconsistent with the economic environment that we've been seeing, I'd be much more concerned.\n\nQ: Of course speaking just to that question here, there is some concern that the Fed's accommodative rates, although they've come up somewhat, it's still so accommodative that -- and bond yields are so low, that obviously investors are pouring more and more money into equities because that's where the returns are.\n\nAnd so the concern is that those equity prices don't necessarily just reflect the economic fundamentals, but of course, reflect people. As bubbles form, people put things in assets they feel are going to continue to keep going up because the other options are not as appealing. Is that a concern?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we're going to continue to review what we're seeing in terms of asset prices. The other positive, too, I think though is that if asset prices go down, what's the consequence of that for the stability of the financial system? Well, I think the financial system is a much, much stronger place today than it was prior to the financial crisis and the Great Recession. Banks have more capital, they have more liquidity while we've corrected I think some of the structural weaknesses in the financial system.\n\nI don't think it's reasonable to think that the Federal Reserve is somehow going to manage financial asset prices so that they are completely stable over time. They are going to go up and down, depending on the economic environment.\n\nWhat we have to be cautious of is making sure that the financial system is robust, so that if there is weakness in financial asset prices, it doesn't contribute to a great stress in the financial system, which then spills into the real economy, to try to avoid what happened during the Great Recession.\n\nQ: There's a widely-held view in financial markets that come September, the Fed will announce that it's starting to trim its balance sheet. Is that view correct?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, we obviously have to have the FOMC meeting to make that decision at the next FOMC meeting. But, I don't think the expectations of market participants are unreasonable. In June, following the June FOMC meeting, we laid out a plan in terms of how we would actually do our balance sheet normalization. How we would allow Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to gradually run off our portfolio over time.\n\nAnd so the plan is out there. It's been I think generally well-received, and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place. In the last FOMC statement, we said that we expected this to happen relatively soon. So, I expect it to happen relatively soon.\n\nQ: And how -- just in a process -- the announcement would come in September, you've got things like the debt ceiling, all of that. Would you expect the actual implementation in October, or would that be delayed? How would that process work?\n\nDUDLEY: First of all, we haven't made any decision yet about whether we're actually going to start in September. So, if we were to start in September, does a debt limit ceiling discussion -- debate -- create difficulties for us? I would say not really, in the sense that the debt that we hold counts against the debt limit, just like the debt held by the private sector.\n\nIn some ways, we're really not part of the -- it doesn't affect -- whether we start or don't start doesn't have really any effect about when the debt limit will actually be binding.\n\nAnd second of all, we can obviously announce the start of the program but delay the actual start date. So I think that -- I don't think the debt limit will have big impact on our decision about whether to start or not start the balance sheet normalization process.\n\nQ: On the issue of the balance sheet, you've suggested that reduction in the balance sheet can affect asset prices differently from an increase in the Funds Rate. Could you speak a little bit about what kind of consequences people can expect -- ordinary people, ordinary businesses -- from the gradual reduction of the balance sheet?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, we need to be somewhat humble about what we know about this because we've never done this before. And that's why I think we've been very, very careful in terms of how we've gradually rolled this out, so that people can see how we're planning to do this.\n\nIt's one of the reasons why the reinvestment process, phasing that down, is going to happen very gradually, that we're not just going to stop abruptly because we want to make sure that the adjustments are small, the model is gentle, and don't have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nSo far I would say that the market reaction has been extraordinarily mild. As expectations have gone from relatively low probability that we're going to start this to a very high probability that we're going to start this relatively soon. And so that makes me more confident that when we start, it's not going to have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nFinally what I would expect is over time, as the Federal Reserve allows its portfolio to run down, that means the private sector has to absorb somewhat larger amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, that will probably put some modest upward pressure on long-term yields.\n\nBut I wouldn't expect it to be very large for a number of reasons. One, it's already anticipated that this is going to happen. And 2) the balance sheet is going to shrink, but we're not going back to where we were in 2007, when the balance sheet was 800 billion.\n\nSo, the shrinkage of the balance sheet is going to be a lot smaller than the increase in the balance sheet that happened before.\n\nQ: ... mortgage rates or business loans. You feel like the economy can absorb that?\n\nDUDLEY: Yes, yes. I mean right now, long-term rates are very, very low. If you had asked me a few years ago could the U.S. economy get to a 4.3% unemployment rate and the Federal Reserve was gradually tightening monetary policy, and 10-year Treasury yields would be 2-1/4%, I would have been quite surprised. (LAUGHTER)\n\nQ: On the balance sheet, Chair Yellen has talked a little bit in her testimony about where it could end up. It's not going to go back to 800 billion, pre-Crisis. Where do you think it might end up?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think that's quite uncertain still because the Federal Reserve has really not made any final decisions about what kind of operating framework we want to have over the longer-term. You can have an operating framework, there's really sort of two broad choices, one where there's just a tiny amount of reserves in the banking system.\n\nThat's what we used prior to the financial crisis. Or a regime, which is called a floor system, where there is quite a bit more reserves in the banking system so the balance sheet would be larger as a consequence.\n\nThe first thing is we have to make that decision, are we going to go back to the old regime where it's just a small amount of reserves in the banking system, or are we going to actually continue with a floor system?\n\nMy own personal view as someone who actually ran the Open Market Desk during the Financial Crisis is I very much favor retaining a floor system, so that would imply more excess reserves in the banking system, and a somewhat bigger balance sheet.\n\nSo, that's the first issue.\n\nThe second issue is we really don't know how much excess reserves we need in the banking system for a floor system to operate efficiently without a lot of day-to-day intervention. Presumably, if we move to a floor system over the longer-term, we're going to want to have enough excess reserves in the banking system, so we don't have to intervene on a day-by-day basis.\n\nIf you have to intervene on a day-by-day basis, you're sort of undermining the whole advantage of operating a floor system.\n\nSo, I think at the end of the day, we're going to sort of learn about how much reserves we're going to need in the -- we're going to make a decision about whether it's going to be a floor system or a recorder system. And then if we decide on a floor system, we're going to learn about how much excess reserves we actually need.\n\nMy own view is, if I had to say today, we're probably going to see a balance sheet five years from now that's probably in the order of 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 trillion rather than the 4-1/2 trillion dollar balance sheet.\n\nBut that's just a rough guess. It depends on a lot of different factors, like how fast does currency grow over the next 5 years.\n\nSo, I think the main point I would want to make about the size of the balance sheet, we're not going back to 800 billion. That's really the thing to underscore. But there's quite a bit of uncertainty about where we're going to actually end up at this point.\n\nQ: You feel good though in this process, that we're not going to have a repeat of 2013, a Taper Tantrum, where we -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I hope so. I mean we've been trying to do this in a way -- being very sensitive to that experience. So making sure that we're gradually educating people about how this balance sheet normalization process works. We're doing it -- we're phasing down the reinvestment at a gradual pace. So the First Quarter when we actually implement this program, only 6 billion of Treasury securities will run off each month. Only 4 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities. And then it gradually phases up over the next three quarters.\n\nSo, all these things are done in part to make sure that there's not a large financial statement reaction, and the fact that so far as we've rolled this out, the markets have responded quite benignly makes me confident that we can avoid the kind of Taper Tantrum that we saw in 2013.\n\nQ: We're at a point now looking at a major amount of change in the makeup of the Federal Reserve Board, and also the Regional Presidents for that matter. A lot of new faces coming on.\n\nIs there a concern that with that much changeover -- I mean you've got three openings now. You could have two more next year possibly. You've got four Regional Fed Presidents who've been there less than 2 years, and likely more. Can the Federal Reserve system -- how is it going to handle all of this change?\n\nDUDLEY: It's not something that I have a great concern about because the mission doesn't change. So Congress has set for the Federal Reserve the dual mandate, responsibilities of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. And we define price stability as 2% inflation.\n\nSo anybody coming onto the Fed -- the mission, that's the mission. And that doesn't change.\n\nThe second thing I would say is that the committee really does have a very strong consensus currently, in terms of what it wants to do going forward. The fact that the addendum to the balance sheet -- to the normalization plans -- was supported by every FOMC participant suggests that there's really strong support for the direction that the Federal Reserve is moving.\n\nAnd lastly, I expect that the new people will be very capable people, and I think they're going to make decisions in a way, very consistent with what we've been doing in recent years.\n\nSo this is not something that I'm concerned about it.\n\nQ: More specifically, President Trump of course has ... the 5 board members he could be appointing within now to the next 10 to 12 months. Given the President's style of seeming to prefer loyalty among appointees that he makes to all sorts of federal positions, does it concern you that the Fed's independence, especially the Board's, could be imperiled in any way by the people he puts in there, and the expectations he has for them?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is ultimately a creature of Congress, and Congress sets the mandate for the Fed, and I think the Fed needs then to be evaluated vis-a-vis that mandate.\n\nAnd so I think anybody coming in is going to feel this is my job, to try to achieve these dual mandate objectives.\n\nThe second thing I would say is the Trump Administration has been very hands-off in terms of the Fed. So, I think they've been very respectful of the monetary policy, not to politicize the monetary policy process. And that's continuing a very long tradition that's been place for going back, really, 25 years to the Clinton Administration, when Bob Rubin was the head of the National Economic Council in the Clinton Administration.\n\nI think we've actually seen a very consistent process of how the administration treats the Fed that's very -- I don't see any meaningful change from what we saw under the Obama Administration or prior administrations.\n\nQ: The Republicans in Congress though have really been pushing in monetary policy a rules-based system. Some of the candidates -- John Taylor -- has rules. Will that change how you set monetary policy? Would you have those kinds of folks coming on?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, you know, it's a committee, and so there's lots of people on the committee. We'll have to see how it all evolves. My own view is, I've been very clear on record that I'm not in favor of a mechanical use of a monetary policy rule.\n\nI think monetary policy rules are useful, as guides, as an input to the monetary policy-setting process. But mechanically using a monetary policy rule I think could lead to pretty significant mistakes in terms of monetary policy.\n\nAnd the example I like to use is what was the Taylor rule calling for in September 2008, when we met in terms of monetary policy? Well, it was saying that the Federal Funds Rate needed to rise significantly in the Fourth Quarter of 2008, which obviously would have been a disaster because the economy was in free-fall.\n\nThe problem with these mechanical rules is they don't really incorporate all the information that's relevant to the monetary policy setting process.\n\nSo, at the September 2008 meeting, Lehman Brothers had just failed. Clearly, this was going to have pretty significant effects on the financial system as we saw. And the U.S. economy was entering a pretty deep recession. This was not the time to be raising interest rates. So, I think the rules are fine as a guide to policy, as an input of policy, and if you look at the documents that accompanied the FOMC meetings that are part of the historical record, you'll see that various monetary policy rules are part of our deliberations. Just don't force us to use them mechanically.\n\nQ: In the area of bank regulation, President Trump was very critical of Dodd-Frank. Republicans in Congress are trying to change it. Do you expect more changes there in how the Fed regulates the banks?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that we -- there are some changes to Dodd-Frank that would be completely appropriate. I've been on record, and other Fed officials have been on record, as arguing for relief for smaller banking institutions. Smaller banking institutions don't create systemic risks to the financial system, so I think they can be treated differently than large banking institutions.\n\nSo, that's certainly something that I think could be done. I think the Volcker Rule could probably be implemented in a way that made it less of a burden for banking firms. The Volcker Rule actually applies to very small banks, which makes very little sense to me.\n\nBut it's important also not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The increase in capital requirements and liquidity requirements I think was very important. We need to keep that. The stress test that the Federal Reserve conducts on banks in order to stress their capital levels, I think is very, very important to retain.\n\nI think that some of the things in the Dodd-Frank Act, like the ability to resolve large systemic institutions without that threatening the rest of the financial system, very, very important that we retain that.\n\nThere is legislation that's been proposed in the House that would eliminate Title 2 of the Dodd-Frank Act. This is the Title that basically says that the FDIC can convert the firm to a new company by converting debt into equity. If you get rid of that, you need something in its place.\n\nMy view is that if a large firm were to get into difficulty and fail, you need 2 things. You need to be able to resolve it over a weekend and you need a source of liquidity on Monday morning because people will run from that institution.\n\nIf you don't have that, you will have a financial crisis that spreads, that has significant contagion. So, you can fix Dodd-Frank in a lot of ways. But it's really important to have the ability to resolve large institutions over the weekend and have a source of liquidity so that when businesses and households run from that troubled institution, there's a source of funding so that entity can be recapitalized and continue to go on.\n\nQ: On a personal level, Gary Cohn has been mentioned as potentially a Fed Chair if Yellen were not to be reappointed or declined. Did you work with Gary Cohn at Goldman Sachs? What is your impression of him as a potential Federal Reserve Chair?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't want to evaluate the various candidates for the Federal Reserve, except to say that I think Gary is a reasonable candidate. He knows a lot about financial markets. He knows lots about the financial system. I don't think you have to have a PhD in Economics, which I have, to be a Chair of the Fed or Governor or a President of one of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nI think it's important to have a committee that has diversity. That has different backgrounds and perspectives. So I think Gary's a reasonable candidate.\n\nQ: Any others you want to -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nQ: -- names you'd mention -- any -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: No, no thanks.\n\nQ: Not going to go there. One of the things that has been discussed is the income inequality. It's gotten to be such a problem. Should the Fed accept some responsibility for the widening in income inequality, just by how they've handled rates and the fact that the wealthy who own stocks and other assets have benefited very well?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think monetary policy really isn't a tool that's well-suited to address issues of income inequality or income mobility. There's a whole other set of tools I think that can address those type of issues. Tax policy, education policy, access to opportunities. I just think it's sort of outside the Fed's purview.\n\nObviously, we care deeply about income inequality and income mobility, and I've been talking about it on a regular basis.\n\nI actually think that the income mobility issue is probably just as important -- or maybe even more important -- than the income inequality issue because I can understand why someone just starting out in their career gets paid less than someone who has a lot more experience and brings a lot more value to a firm.\n\nI understand that kind of income inequality. What I find a lot harder to justify is the fact that a lot of research has shown that where you're born, literally the physical location of where you're born, affects your ability to move up the income mobility scale over time, which seems extraordinarily unfair to me.\n\nSo, we've been putting a lot of emphasis at the bank on really trying to understand the issues of income mobility and trying to raise this issue in terms of people's consciousness. And try to develop more of a dialogue about what we could actually do about it, which I think is job training, it's access to opportunities.\n\nSome of the cities that we travel to around the Second District, there are jobs available in the suburbs, and the people in the inner city can't get to those jobs. So, sometimes it's just things simple like transportation. The ability of people to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\nI think that not providing people with opportunities I think is bad.\n\nQ: Who's to blame for this then?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we've just -- I think there hasn't been enough focus on the consequences of globalization, which I think have left people behind. And I think there hasn't been enough focus on trying to improve the opportunities for all Americans, not just some Americans.\n\nSo, that's what I'd like to see happen in the coming years.\n\nQ: We're in an unusual policy mix at the moment. You've got North Korea. Very big threat there. A variety of issues going on. Is this a hard time for Fed policymakers in particular, just because of the seeming gridlock in Washington and the heightened rhetoric that's out and about?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think this is a particularly tough time. I certainly would rather be here than back in 2007, 2008. If you look at where we are, the economy is growing above trend, the unemployment rate is at 4.3%. Inflation is a little bit below our target, but not a lot below our target, so we're not missing our inflation objective by a huge margin.\n\nIf you look at what economists call the so-called Misery Index, the sum of inflation plus unemployment, we're probably at one of the best places we've been at for the last 50 years.\n\nSo, if we could just stay here -- (LAUGHS) -- and emulate Australia which is in their 26th year of economic expansion, that would be great.\n\nI think this is a good place to be, and I'm hoping that we can just act in a way to sustain this economic expansion so it can benefit a broader set of Americans.\n\nQ: We're in the third longest, now in our 9th year -- 10 years has been the maximum. When does the next recession happen?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think that economic expansions die from old age. I think they die because either the economy is hit with a very adverse shock. Oftentimes those are very difficult to anticipate. Or because inflation gets out of hand and the Federal Reserve has to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation under control.\n\nClearly, we don't have that latter problem right now. The Fed has no reason in my view to act aggressively to tighten monetary policy. If you look at what we've done, we've been very, very gentle in terms of how we've been removing monetary policy accommodation.\n\nAnd as long as inflation stays low, I think that's going to continue. So, certainly, there is very little risk to the expansion coming from the Fed.\n\nYou could also look at the economy. It seems to be in pretty good balance. The household sector I think is well-supported by rising wages and strong job growth and a good balance sheet.\n\nI think that the international outlook has improved, and the dollar has weakened, and I think that provides support to business fixed investment spending and the country's trade performance.\n\nSo, yes, it's a pretty long-lived expansion but I don't really see things on the horizon. Knock on wood.\n\n(AUDIO LOST BRIEFLY - (00:32:43))\n\n-- recession is imminent.\n\nQ: You see no bubbles of any assets? Because that ultimately is what --\n\nDUDLEY: I mean that's too strong. I mean I think there are areas where you could sort of say, boy, asset prices might be somewhat overvalued in certain areas. But this is totally different than -- not 2007. The housing market was up dramatically. It's a hugely big market in terms of dollar value.\n\nSo when that started to unwind, the amount of stress that it put on the financial system was severe, and we had a much more fragile financial system at the time.\n\nI think we're in a very different place than we were then.\n\nQ: Just getting from 2% to 5%, 4%, 3% --\n\nDUDLEY: For growth?\n\nQ: GDP growth, yes.\n\nDUDLEY: Well, productivity growth is the key driver. I mean Real GDP growth is really the sum of how much labor input you have, plus how much productivity is increasing per an hour worked. So the way to get growth -- in the labor force, growth rate is really driven by demographics and immigration policy.\n\nSo, the labor force is not growing that fast. The only way you're going to get to a higher growth rate is by raising the productivity growth rate. And we'll see. Obviously, to the extent that you have some regulatory relief, that will probably push you in the right direction. It's possible that there could be new technological discoveries and dissemination of those technologies that can raise productivity growth over time.\n\nBut it's really productivity growth that we need to be focused on if we're going to try to get to a higher sustainable Real GDP growth rate.\n\nQ: So, at the moment, no change in the Fed long term forecast?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean we've had a period of years where productivity growth has disappointed. The last year it's a little bit better. We're above 1% over the last four quarters, so we'll see.\n\nI mean this is very difficult to forecast. Obviously I would hope for higher productivity growth rather than lower productivity growth because that would boost people's standards of livings. Their real incomes would rise over time.\n\nSo, I'm in favor of Congress and the Administration, and state and local governments, doing things that raise productivity growth. Part of it's giving people better job skills, better opportunities.

Could you tell us, are you lowering it now, that his program is -- your own personal forecast -- are you lowering it given that his economic program is at the moment stalled? Any comments?\n\nWILLIAM DUDLEY: My outlook for the economy hasn't changed materially since the beginning of the year. Continue to look for growths around 2%, slightly above trend, growth sufficient to continue to tighten the labour market. I did not raise my growth forecast after the Election because of the prospect of fiscal stimulus because I felt that there was a lot of uncertainty about how big it would be, what its composition would be, and when it would actually take effect.\n\nSo, I always viewed it as a risk to the forecast. In other words, an upside risk to the forecast, but I never put it into my baseline forecast.\n\nI think we're still on the same trajectory we've been on for several years. Above trend growth, gradually tightening labour market, inflation -- somewhat below our objective -- but we do expect as the labour market continues to tighten, to see firmer wage gains and that will ultimately filter into inflation moving up towards our 2% objective.\n\nQ: What do you see as the evidence for the labour market tightening?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think you can see it just directly in the unemployment rate, 4.3%, that's the lowest unemployment rate we've had in many years. If you look at some of the broader measures of unemployment, they have also come down to levels that we reached prior to the great recession. So, a pretty broad range of evidence that suggests the labour market is quite a bit tighter than it's been in many years. Which is a good thing.\n\nQ: Sure. In an appearance last week you said that the inflation that you look at might not get back up to 2% for 6 to 10 months, just given ... Given that outlook, why be thinking of raising rates at all?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, the reason why inflation won't get up to 2% very quickly on a year-over-year basis is because we've had these very low inflation readings over the last 4 or 5 months. So it's going to take time for those to sort of drop out of the year-over-year calculation.\n\nBut I think if you look at inflation sequentially, in other words what's inflation likely to actually do over the next 6 months, I'm expecting somewhat higher readings than what we've had over the last 6 months.\n\nNow the reason why I think you'd want to continue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation, even with inflation somewhat below target, is that 1) monetary policy is still accommodative, so the level of short-term rates is pretty low, and 2) and this is probably even more important, financial conditions have been easing rather than tightening. So despite the fact that we've raised short-term interest rates, financial conditions are easier today than they were a year ago.\n\nThe stock market's up, credit spreads have narrowed, the dollar has weakened, and those have more than offset the effects of somewhat higher short-term rates and the very modest increases that we've seen in longer-term yields.\n\nQ: The markets right now are putting about a 50-50 odds of even a rate hike as late as December. Is it likely that 2 may be it for this year?\n\nDUDLEY: I think it depends on how the economic forecast evolves. If it evolves in line with my expectations, I would expect -- I would be in favour of doing another rate hike later this year.\n\nQ: Speaking a little more broadly about the issue of inflation, as you know of course there's a school of thought that says that we are in an environment where low inflation may persist far longer than anybody expects. One, it's not just domestically but globally as well.\n\nNobody knows, of course, whether that's correct or not. But we obviously do see very, very low inflation globally. Forecasts, including the Fed's own forecasts of inflation going back 2, 3, 4 years have consistently proved below what turned out to be reality.\n\nHow do you wrestle, or how do you reconcile the Fed's plans or policymaking with the idea that we may be in a long-term environment. Or, an environment of long-term persistently low inflation, and that perhaps the Fed should walk away from a 2% target? Or adjust it, or just in some ways, come to grips with the reality, or the potential reality, that we're in a very, very low inflation environment going forward for a long time?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think there's a fundamental question about whether are we in a new regime or is it just going to take some time for the inflation to move higher? There are long lags between getting to a tight labour market and that actually showing up in higher wages, and those wages then pushing into inflation.\n\nSo, I think the jury's out of whether there is sort of structural, secular changes in place that are holding inflation lower on a sustained basis.\n\nI mean one can identify some reasons for thinking that that could continue the ability for consumers and businesses to see what the prices of goods and services are broadly across a wide range of people selling goods and services is very, very good.\n\nThe distribution methods of how goods and services are provided have changed pretty dramatically. So this -- and I think that's probably eroding pricing power and brand loyalty. It's possible that that could be putting downward pressure on inflation.\n\nBut if that's the case, that's not really a bad thing. That means we can actually allow the economy to operate at a higher level potentially of resource utilization.\n\nIf it's true that inflation is going to be lower on a secular basis, that should allow us to continue to let the economy run a little bit longer. And continue to have above-trend job gains and to see the unemployment rate even move a little bit lower.\n\nSo, I think the jury is out, whether this lags or is just going to take some time for it to show through, or whether we're in a different regime.\n\nI think the next 4 to 6 months I think are going to be important to see whether the readings that we've had over the last few months are mainly due to one-off factors, such as the big decline that we've seen in cellphone prices, or whether there's something more fundamental going on.\n\nQ: Would you entertain at least the possibility that the Fed might at some point just have to suspend its rate increases, just to deal with the reality that rates remain persistently low?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that if the economy continues to grow above trend, and the labour market continues to tighten, I do think we'll get to the point where that will lead to higher wages and that will show up in terms of higher inflation.\n\nNow, the question is at what level of the unemployment rate will that all take place? So, if there are these secular forces that are pushing inflation lower, perhaps we can actually go to a somewhat lower unemployment rate. I would actually view -- rather than people wringing their hands that this is so awful that inflation is low, it actually might be a good thing because it could allow you to run the economy at a little bit higher level of resource utilization, which I think ... people get employed, they get job skills, they'd be able to build their human capital over time. (00:07:29) The productive capacity of the U.S. economy would be greater -- all those things would be good things.\n\nWhat we have to do, though, to discern is, what we see on inflation, is this temporary or is this something that's going to be more persistent?\n\nQ: You feel the jury is out on that?\n\nDUDLEY: I think the jury is out on that.\n\nQ: Given this nine-year period of very low rates, it has spawned talk about asset bubbles. Stock prices are record levels. Bond prices are up. Alan Greenspan said the bond market is going to collapse as you raise rates. Are you concerned about asset bubbles?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean obviously, we need to continue to always look at the financial system to see whether there are misaligned asset prices that are misaligned relative to the fundamentals because if the asset prices were to move sharply, that would presumably create quite a bit of stress on the financial system.\n\nThen the question is could the financial system withstand that stress? So, this is something we do look at on a regular basis.\n\nMy own view is that -- I'm not particularly concerned about where our asset prices are today for a couple of reasons. The main one is that I think that the asset prices are pretty consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the actual performance of the economy.\n\nThe economy has been evolving in a very low volatility way, 2% growth a year, pretty steady. Inflation has stayed low. There is not much volatility in the economy, and I think that's translated to low volatility in financial asset markets, and that's actually helped lift valuations.\n\nNow obviously this means that if the economic outlook changed, if we got a lot more volatility in terms of the economy, then that could potentially prove problematic for financial markets.\n\nBut right now, it seems to me like the financial statements are behaving in a way that's consistent with the economic environment that we're seeing. If the financial statements were behaving in a way inconsistent with the economic environment that we've been seeing, I'd be much more concerned.\n\nQ: Of course speaking just to that question here, there is some concern that the Fed's accommodative rates, although they've come up somewhat, it's still so accommodative that -- and bond yields are so low, that obviously investors are pouring more and more money into equities because that's where the returns are.\n\nAnd so the concern is that those equity prices don't necessarily just reflect the economic fundamentals, but of course, reflect people. As bubbles form, people put things in assets they feel are going to continue to keep going up because the other options are not as appealing. Is that a concern?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we're going to continue to review what we're seeing in terms of asset prices. The other positive, too, I think though is that if asset prices go down, what's the consequence of that for the stability of the financial system? Well, I think the financial system is a much, much stronger place today than it was prior to the financial crisis and the Great Recession. Banks have more capital, they have more liquidity while we've corrected I think some of the structural weaknesses in the financial system.\n\nI don't think it's reasonable to think that the Federal Reserve is somehow going to manage financial asset prices so that they are completely stable over time. They are going to go up and down, depending on the economic environment.\n\nWhat we have to be cautious of is making sure that the financial system is robust, so that if there is weakness in financial asset prices, it doesn't contribute to a great stress in the financial system, which then spills into the real economy, to try to avoid what happened during the Great Recession.\n\nQ: There's a widely-held view in financial markets that come September, the Fed will announce that it's starting to trim its balance sheet. Is that view correct?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, we obviously have to have the FOMC meeting to make that decision at the next FOMC meeting. But, I don't think the expectations of market participants are unreasonable. In June, following the June FOMC meeting, we laid out a plan in terms of how we would actually do our balance sheet normalization. How we would allow Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to gradually run off our portfolio over time.\n\nAnd so the plan is out there. It's been I think generally well-received, and fully anticipated. People expect it to take place. In the last FOMC statement, we said that we expected this to happen relatively soon. So, I expect it to happen relatively soon.\n\nQ: And how -- just in a process -- the announcement would come in September, you've got things like the debt ceiling, all of that. Would you expect the actual implementation in October, or would that be delayed? How would that process work?\n\nDUDLEY: First of all, we haven't made any decision yet about whether we're actually going to start in September. So, if we were to start in September, does a debt limit ceiling discussion -- debate -- create difficulties for us? I would say not really, in the sense that the debt that we hold counts against the debt limit, just like the debt held by the private sector.\n\nIn some ways, we're really not part of the -- it doesn't affect -- whether we start or don't start doesn't have really any effect about when the debt limit will actually be binding.\n\nAnd second of all, we can obviously announce the start of the program but delay the actual start date. So I think that -- I don't think the debt limit will have big impact on our decision about whether to start or not start the balance sheet normalization process.\n\nQ: On the issue of the balance sheet, you've suggested that reduction in the balance sheet can affect asset prices differently from an increase in the Funds Rate. Could you speak a little bit about what kind of consequences people can expect -- ordinary people, ordinary businesses -- from the gradual reduction of the balance sheet?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, we need to be somewhat humble about what we know about this because we've never done this before. And that's why I think we've been very, very careful in terms of how we've gradually rolled this out, so that people can see how we're planning to do this.\n\nIt's one of the reasons why the reinvestment process, phasing that down, is going to happen very gradually, that we're not just going to stop abruptly because we want to make sure that the adjustments are small, the model is gentle, and don't have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nSo far I would say that the market reaction has been extraordinarily mild. As expectations have gone from relatively low probability that we're going to start this to a very high probability that we're going to start this relatively soon. And so that makes me more confident that when we start, it's not going to have a big consequence for financial statements.\n\nFinally what I would expect is over time, as the Federal Reserve allows its portfolio to run down, that means the private sector has to absorb somewhat larger amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, that will probably put some modest upward pressure on long-term yields.\n\nBut I wouldn't expect it to be very large for a number of reasons. One, it's already anticipated that this is going to happen. And 2) the balance sheet is going to shrink, but we're not going back to where we were in 2007, when the balance sheet was 800 billion.\n\nSo, the shrinkage of the balance sheet is going to be a lot smaller than the increase in the balance sheet that happened before.\n\nQ: ... mortgage rates or business loans. You feel like the economy can absorb that?\n\nDUDLEY: Yes, yes. I mean right now, long-term rates are very, very low. If you had asked me a few years ago could the U.S. economy get to a 4.3% unemployment rate and the Federal Reserve was gradually tightening monetary policy, and 10-year Treasury yields would be 2-1/4%, I would have been quite surprised. (LAUGHTER)\n\nQ: On the balance sheet, Chair Yellen has talked a little bit in her testimony about where it could end up. It's not going to go back to 800 billion, pre-Crisis. Where do you think it might end up?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think that's quite uncertain still because the Federal Reserve has really not made any final decisions about what kind of operating framework we want to have over the longer-term. You can have an operating framework, there's really sort of two broad choices, one where there's just a tiny amount of reserves in the banking system.\n\nThat's what we used prior to the financial crisis. Or a regime, which is called a floor system, where there is quite a bit more reserves in the banking system so the balance sheet would be larger as a consequence.\n\nThe first thing is we have to make that decision, are we going to go back to the old regime where it's just a small amount of reserves in the banking system, or are we going to actually continue with a floor system?\n\nMy own personal view as someone who actually ran the Open Market Desk during the Financial Crisis is I very much favour retaining a floor system, so that would imply more excess reserves in the banking system, and a somewhat bigger balance sheet.\n\nSo, that's the first issue.\n\nThe second issue is we really don't know how much excess reserves we need in the banking system for a floor system to operate efficiently without a lot of day-to-day intervention. Presumably, if we move to a floor system over the longer-term, we're going to want to have enough excess reserves in the banking system, so we don't have to intervene on a day-by-day basis.\n\nIf you have to intervene on a day-by-day basis, you're sort of undermining the whole advantage of operating a floor system.\n\nSo, I think at the end of the day, we're going to sort of learn about how much reserves we're going to need in the -- we're going to make a decision about whether it's going to be a floor system or a recorder system. And then if we decide on a floor system, we're going to learn about how much excess reserves we actually need.\n\nMy own view is, if I had to say today, we're probably going to see a balance sheet five years from now that's probably in the order of 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 trillion rather than the 4-1/2 trillion dollar balance sheet.\n\nBut that's just a rough guess. It depends on a lot of different factors, like how fast does currency grow over the next 5 years.\n\nSo, I think the main point I would want to make about the size of the balance sheet, we're not going back to 800 billion. That's really the thing to underscore. But there's quite a bit of uncertainty about where we're going to actually end up at this point.\n\nQ: You feel good though in this process, that we're not going to have a repeat of 2013, a Taper Tantrum, where we -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I hope so. I mean we've been trying to do this in a way -- being very sensitive to that experience. So making sure that we're gradually educating people about how this balance sheet normalization process works. We're doing it -- we're phasing down the reinvestment at a gradual pace. So the First Quarter when we actually implement this program, only 6 billion of Treasury securities will run off each month. Only 4 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities. And then it gradually phases up over the next three quarters.\n\nSo, all these things are done in part to make sure that there's not a large financial statement reaction, and the fact that so far as we've rolled this out, the markets have responded quite benignly makes me confident that we can avoid the kind of Taper Tantrum that we saw in 2013.\n\nQ: We're at a point now looking at a major amount of change in the makeup of the Federal Reserve Board, and also the Regional Presidents for that matter. A lot of new faces coming on.\n\nIs there a concern that with that much changeover -- I mean you've got three openings now. You could have two more next year possibly. You've got four Regional Fed Presidents who've been there less than 2 years, and likely more. Can the Federal Reserve system -- how is it going to handle all of this change?\n\nDUDLEY: It's not something that I have a great concern about because the mission doesn't change. So Congress has set for the Federal Reserve the dual mandate, responsibilities of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. And we define price stability as 2% inflation.\n\nSo anybody coming onto the Fed -- the mission, that's the mission. And that doesn't change.\n\nThe second thing I would say is that the committee really does have a very strong consensus currently, in terms of what it wants to do going forward. The fact that the addendum to the balance sheet -- to the normalization plans -- was supported by every FOMC participant suggests that there's really strong support for the direction that the Federal Reserve is moving.\n\nAnd lastly, I expect that the new people will be very capable people, and I think they're going to make decisions in a way, very consistent with what we've been doing in recent years.\n\nSo this is not something that I'm concerned about it.\n\nQ: More specifically, President Trump of course has ... the 5 board members he could be appointing within now to the next 10 to 12 months. Given the President's style of seeming to prefer loyalty among appointees that he makes to all sorts of federal positions, does it concern you that the Fed's independence, especially the Board's, could be imperiled in any way by the people he puts in there, and the expectations he has for them?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is ultimately a creature of Congress, and Congress sets the mandate for the Fed, and I think the Fed needs then to be evaluated vis-a-vis that mandate.\n\nAnd so I think anybody coming in is going to feel this is my job, to try to achieve these dual mandate objectives.\n\nThe second thing I would say is the Trump Administration has been very hands-off in terms of the Fed. So, I think they've been very respectful of the monetary policy, not to politicize the monetary policy process. And that's continuing a very long tradition that's been place for going back, really, 25 years to the Clinton Administration, when Bob Rubin was the head of the National Economic Council in the Clinton Administration.\n\nI think we've actually seen a very consistent process of how the administration treats the Fed that's very -- I don't see any meaningful change from what we saw under the Obama Administration or prior administrations.\n\nQ: The Republicans in Congress though have really been pushing in monetary policy a rules-based system. Some of the candidates -- John Taylor -- has rules. Will that change how you set monetary policy? Would you have those kinds of folks coming on?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, you know, it's a committee, and so there's lots of people on the committee. We'll have to see how it all evolves. My own view is, I've been very clear on record that I'm not in favour of a mechanical use of a monetary policy rule.\n\nI think monetary policy rules are useful, as guides, as an input to the monetary policy-setting process. But mechanically using a monetary policy rule I think could lead to pretty significant mistakes in terms of monetary policy.\n\nAnd the example I like to use is what was the Taylor rule calling for in September 2008, when we met in terms of monetary policy? Well, it was saying that the Federal Funds Rate needed to rise significantly in the Fourth Quarter of 2008, which obviously would have been a disaster because the economy was in free-fall.\n\nThe problem with these mechanical rules is they don't really incorporate all the information that's relevant to the monetary policy setting process.\n\nSo, at the September 2008 meeting, Lehman Brothers had just failed. Clearly, this was going to have pretty significant effects on the financial system as we saw. And the U.S. economy was entering a pretty deep recession. This was not the time to be raising interest rates. So, I think the rules are fine as a guide to policy, as an input of policy, and if you look at the documents that accompanied the FOMC meetings that are part of the historical record, you'll see that various monetary policy rules are part of our deliberations. Just don't force us to use them mechanically.\n\nQ: In the area of bank regulation, President Trump was very critical of Dodd-Frank. Republicans in Congress are trying to change it. Do you expect more changes there in how the Fed regulates the banks?\n\nDUDLEY: I think that we -- there are some changes to Dodd-Frank that would be completely appropriate. I've been on record, and other Fed officials have been on record, as arguing for relief for smaller banking institutions. Smaller banking institutions don't create systemic risks to the financial system, so I think they can be treated differently than large banking institutions.\n\nSo, that's certainly something that I think could be done. I think the Volcker Rule could probably be implemented in a way that made it less of a burden for banking firms. The Volcker Rule actually applies to very small banks, which makes very little sense to me.\n\nBut it's important also not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The increase in capital requirements and liquidity requirements I think was very important. We need to keep that. The stress test that the Federal Reserve conducts on banks in order to stress their capital levels, I think is very, very important to retain.\n\nI think that some of the things in the Dodd-Frank Act, like the ability to resolve large systemic institutions without that threatening the rest of the financial system, very, very important that we retain that.\n\nThere is legislation that's been proposed in the House that would eliminate Title 2 of the Dodd-Frank Act. This is the Title that basically says that the FDIC can convert the firm to a new company by converting debt into equity. If you get rid of that, you need something in its place.\n\nMy view is that if a large firm were to get into difficulty and fail, you need 2 things. You need to be able to resolve it over a weekend and you need a source of liquidity on Monday morning because people will run from that institution.\n\nIf you don't have that, you will have a financial crisis that spreads, that has significant contagion. So, you can fix Dodd-Frank in a lot of ways. But it's really important to have the ability to resolve large institutions over the weekend and have a source of liquidity so that when businesses and households run from that troubled institution, there's a source of funding so that entity can be recapitalized and continue to go on.\n\nQ: On a personal level, Gary Cohn has been mentioned as potentially a Fed Chair if Yellen were not to be reappointed or declined. Did you work with Gary Cohn at Goldman Sachs? What is your impression of him as a potential Federal Reserve Chair?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't want to evaluate the various candidates for the Federal Reserve, except to say that I think Gary is a reasonable candidate. He knows a lot about financial markets. He knows lots about the financial system. I don't think you have to have a PhD in Economics, which I have, to be a Chair of the Fed or Governor or a President of one of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nI think it's important to have a committee that has diversity. That has different backgrounds and perspectives. So I think Gary's a reasonable candidate.\n\nQ: Any others you want to -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nQ: -- names you'd mention -- any -- ?\n\nDUDLEY: No, no thanks.\n\nQ: Not going to go there. One of the things that has been discussed is the income inequality. It's gotten to be such a problem. Should the Fed accept some responsibility for the widening in income inequality, just by how they've handled rates and the fact that the wealthy who own stocks and other assets have benefited very well?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think monetary policy really isn't a tool that's well-suited to address issues of income inequality or income mobility. There's a whole other set of tools I think that can address those type of issues. Tax policy, education policy, access to opportunities. I just think it's sort of outside the Fed's purview.\n\nObviously, we care deeply about income inequality and income mobility, and I've been talking about it on a regular basis.\n\nI actually think that the income mobility issue is probably just as important -- or maybe even more important -- than the income inequality issue because I can understand why someone just starting out in their career gets paid less than someone who has a lot more experience and brings a lot more value to a firm.\n\nI understand that kind of income inequality. What I find a lot harder to justify is the fact that a lot of research has shown that where you're born, literally the physical location of where you're born, affects your ability to move up the income mobility scale over time, which seems extraordinarily unfair to me.\n\nSo, we've been putting a lot of emphasis at the bank on really trying to understand the issues of income mobility and trying to raise this issue in terms of people's consciousness. And try to develop more of a dialogue about what we could actually do about it, which I think is job training, it's access to opportunities.\n\nSome of the cities that we travel to around the Second District, there are jobs available in the suburbs, and the people in the inner city can't get to those jobs. So, sometimes it's just things simple like transportation. The ability of people to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\nI think that not providing people with opportunities I think is bad.\n\nQ: Who's to blame for this then?\n\nDUDLEY: I think we've just -- I think there hasn't been enough focus on the consequences of globalization, which I think have left people behind. And I think there hasn't been enough focus on trying to improve the opportunities for all Americans, not just some Americans.\n\nSo, that's what I'd like to see happen in the coming years.\n\nQ: We're in an unusual policy mix at the moment. You've got North Korea. Very big threat there. A variety of issues going on. Is this a hard time for Fed policymakers in particular, just because of the seeming gridlock in Washington and the heightened rhetoric that's out and about?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think this is a particularly tough time. I certainly would rather be here than back in 2007, 2008. If you look at where we are, the economy is growing above trend, the unemployment rate is at 4.3%. Inflation is a little bit below our target, but not a lot below our target, so we're not missing our inflation objective by a huge margin.\n\nIf you look at what economists call the so-called Misery Index, the sum of inflation plus unemployment, we're probably at one of the best places we've been at for the last 50 years.\n\nSo, if we could just stay here -- (LAUGHS) -- and emulate Australia which is in their 26th year of economic expansion, that would be great.\n\nI think this is a good place to be, and I'm hoping that we can just act in a way to sustain this economic expansion so it can benefit a broader set of Americans.\n\nQ: We're in the third longest, now in our 9th year -- 10 years has been the maximum. When does the next recession happen?\n\nDUDLEY: I don't think that economic expansions die from old age. I think they die because either the economy is hit with a very adverse shock. Oftentimes those are very difficult to anticipate. Or because inflation gets out of hand and the Federal Reserve has to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation under control.\n\nClearly, we don't have that latter problem right now. The Fed has no reason in my view to act aggressively to tighten monetary policy. If you look at what we've done, we've been very, very gentle in terms of how we've been removing monetary policy accommodation.\n\nAnd as long as inflation stays low, I think that's going to continue. So, certainly, there is very little risk to the expansion coming from the Fed.\n\nYou could also look at the economy. It seems to be in pretty good balance. The household sector I think is well-supported by rising wages and strong job growth and a good balance sheet.\n\nI think that the international outlook has improved, and the dollar has weakened, and I think that provides support to business fixed investment spending and the country's trade performance.\n\nSo, yes, it's a pretty long-lived expansion but I don't really see things on the horizon. Knock on wood.\n\n(AUDIO LOST BRIEFLY - (00:32:43))\n\n-- recession is imminent.\n\nQ: You see no bubbles of any assets? Because that ultimately is what --\n\nDUDLEY: I mean that's too strong. I mean I think there are areas where you could sort of say, boy, asset prices might be somewhat overvalued in certain areas. But this is totally different than -- not 2007. The housing market was up dramatically. It's a hugely big market in terms of dollar value.\n\nSo when that started to unwind, the amount of stress that it put on the financial system was severe, and we had a much more fragile financial system at the time.\n\nI think we're in a very different place than we were then.\n\nQ: Just getting from 2% to 5%, 4%, 3% --\n\nDUDLEY: For growth?\n\nQ: GDP growth, yes.\n\nDUDLEY: Well, productivity growth is the key driver. I mean Real GDP growth is really the sum of how much labour input you have, plus how much productivity is increasing per an hour worked. So the way to get growth -- in the labour force, growth rate is really driven by demographics and immigration policy.\n\nSo, the labour force is not growing that fast. The only way you're going to get to a higher growth rate is by raising the productivity growth rate. And we'll see. Obviously, to the extent that you have some regulatory relief, that will probably push you in the right direction. It's possible that there could be new technological discoveries and dissemination of those technologies that can raise productivity growth over time.\n\nBut it's really productivity growth that we need to be focused on if we're going to try to get to a higher sustainable Real GDP growth rate.\n\nQ: So, at the moment, no change in the Fed long term forecast?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I mean we've had a period of years where productivity growth has disappointed. The last year it's a little bit better. We're above 1% over the last four quarters, so we'll see.\n\nI mean this is very difficult to forecast. Obviously I would hope for higher productivity growth rather than lower productivity growth because that would boost people's standards of livings. Their real incomes would rise over time.\n\nSo, I'm in favour of Congress and the Administration, and state and local governments, doing things that raise productivity growth. Part of it's giving people better job skills, better opportunities.

Read the minutes from the Federal Reserve's late July meeting and you'll get a good sense -- if you can stay awake that long.\n\nWednesday's minutes revealed virtually no new information and elicited almost no market response.\n\nConsider mortgage-backed securities, which could be affected by the Fed's plans to shrink its holdings. Walter Schmidt of FTN Financial writes:\n\nWe will keep this extremely brief, primarily because there is not much to say. MBS spreads are virtually unchanged in the minutes after the release of the FOMC meeting minutes from July 26. In fact, we have refreshed our screens a few times since 2pm to make sure we are not missing anything, and we are not. The FOMC did not really say much in the minutes that it has not already said in statements, and the market seems to like that just fine.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year note stayed at 2.23% immediately after the 2 p.m. release. After about a half hour, it had inched down 1 basis point. This was a very muted reaction for the Fed minues.\n\nIan Lyngen and Aaron Kohli of BMO Capital Markets write:\n\nThe Treasury market has done little with the release, other than to hold the bid that followed news of Trump's disbanded Manufacturing Council and Strategy and Policy Forum -- further fallout from the President's comments regarding the violence in Charlottesville.\n\nThe only detail they highlight is a fair amount of disagreement about inflation and highlight this passage from the minutes:\n\nMost participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Many participants, however, saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below 2 percent for longer than they currently expected, and several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside.\n\nKrishna Memani, chief investment officer at OppenheimerFunds, agrees the minutes reflect growing concern about inflation among FOMC members, \"but I don't think as of now it is in the majority,\" he tells Barron's. \" If that trend continues, that may change.\"\n\nHe doesn't think the Fed will hike rates in \"the foreseeable future\" but he does think it will start shrinking its balance sheet this fall, which will have only a marginal impact on markets and go on for a long time. \"They want to riase rates, but low inflation is not giving them the opportunity,\" he says. \"They are deathly afraid of mainking a policy mistake.\"\n\nInvestors were looking for new details on the Fed's plans to shrink the balance sheet. But what they got mostly confirmed market expectations that a plan could be announced as soon as September. Here's a passage on that topic:\n\nParticipants generally agreed that, in light of their current assessment of economic conditions and the outlook, it was appropriate to signal that implementation of the program likely would begin relatively soon, absent significant adverse developments in the economy or in financial markets. Many noted that the program was expected to contribute only modestly to the reduction in policy accommodation. Several reiterated that, once the program was under way, further adjustments to the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments would be centered on changes in the target range for the federal funds rate. Although several participants were prepared to announce a starting date for the program at the current meeting, most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting while accumulating additional information on the economic outlook and developments potentially affecting financial markets.\n\nHere's how the minutes describe the broader U.s. economy:\n\nMeeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains had been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had declined, on net, over the same period. Household spending and business fixed investment had continued to expand. On a 12\u2011month basis, both overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below 2 percent.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 149, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 151, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Marketing_and_Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 241, "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Marketing and Advertising"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 265, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events/Business_and_Economy", "wgt": 100, "id": 266, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events/Business and Economy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 100, "id": 480, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "wgt": 100, "id": 741, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 100, "id": 940, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMO_Capital_Markets", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303084", "label": {"eng": "BMO Capital Markets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304196", "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304197", "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304730", "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306369", "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311126", "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313228", "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314104", "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_investment_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "338813", "label": {"eng": "Chief investment officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron's_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "354783", "label": {"eng": "Barron's (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "413569", "label": {"eng": "Mainichi Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyngen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "428013", "label": {"eng": "Lyngen"}}]}

Thursday the market is underestimating the likelihood.\n\n\"While we will need to see inflation tick up for the Fed to hike, we certainly think they are in play for December.\n\n\"They've got a dual mandate and the other side of the equation in terms of employment and labor market is very strong,\" she said.\n\nAt the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting central bank policymakers voted to hold the current target rate in a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent.\n\nMinutes released Wednesday from that July decision show some policymakers are pushing for caution on rate hikes due to low inflation, while others believe it's risky to change from the path of normalisation.\n\nAnd on whether U.S. inflation weakness is just a temporary blip or a longer term issue, Dysenchuk said the solid U.S. growth picture allied to the tight labor market will provide upward pressure on wages.\n\n\"We think it is just a matter of time and over the medium and long term we expect to see inflation to kick in.\n\n\"So again we expect to see the Fed hike rates in December with probably another couple of hikes next year in order to get to that zero percent real yield and then they might pause and

ANZ is tipping next month as when balance sheet reduction could start.\n\nIn an economic note, National Australia Bank's Tapas Strickland wrote that the market believes there is only about a one-in-three chance of the Fed raising interest rates again this year.\n\n\"On the minutes, while 'most' FOMC members still expect inflation to pick up over the next couple of years, 'many' still see some likelihood that inflation might remain below 2 per cent for longer than they currently expect and 'several' indicate that the risks could be tilted to the downside,\" he observed.\n\n\"It's clear from this that the FOMC is split on the trajectory for near term inflation and that the Fed will be monitoring inflation developments 'closely'.\"\n\nMr Strickland said the disbanding of President Trump's business councils came as a surprise.\n\n\"For the market, it's another reason why Trump's policy agenda is going nowhere fast soon -- a point also made in the Fed minutes, where several participants noted uncertainty was tending to weight down firms' spending and hiring plans,\" he added.\n\nThe prospect of no more interest rises in the US for some time sparked a sell-off of the greenback which has boosted the Australian dollar.\n\nIt jumped more than one cent overnight from around 78.25 US cents to about 79.30 as the US currency fell.\n\nSpot gold also gained against the weaker greenback, but oil prices edged down despite stockpiles in the US dropping by the most in a year.\n\nIt is a big day of profit results in Australia with investment bank Morgan Stanley calling it the biggest day of reporting season in terms of major players on the market.\n\nTelstra is expected to churn out an annual profit close to $4 billion with the focus likely to be the future of its generous dividend in the face of falling sales.\n\nOther key results out today include retail and mining conglomerate Wesfarmers, insurer QBE, the stock market operator ASX, Treasury Wine Estates, hearing device maker Cochlear, property firm Mirvac and miner Whitehaven Coal.\n\nAustralia's latest employment figures are also released from the Bureau of Statistics at 11:30am (AEST).\n\nThe

He blamed the weaker dollar (UUP) for lower import prices. It's the first instance recently that US dollar weakness has been mentioned as a concern. There were always complaints that the US dollar was too strong and it impacted US exports' competitive advantage. In this case, Dudley was referring to the dollar's weakness regarding inflation.\n\nLower wage growth was also a concern for Dudley because it impacts inflation growth. Dudley said that sluggish US productivity limits wage growth. It was one of the key reasons that US inflation wasn't rising despite unemployment reaching multi-decade lows.\n\nIt's evident that the FOMC members are concerned about the slowing US economy. The slower economy could translate to a slower pace of rate hikes in the near term. Growing geopolitical tensions between the US and North Korea could limit the Fed.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose from 2.20% to 2.23% after the interview was published Monday.\n\nHe also pointed to easier financial conditions as reason tightening monetary policy makes sense. Here's a key section of the interview:\n\nNow the reason why I think you'd want to continue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation, even with inflation somewhat below target, is that 1) monetary policy is still accommodative, so the level of short-term rates is pretty low, and 2) and this is probably even more important, financial conditions have been easing rather than tightening. So despite the fact that we've raised short-term interest rates, financial conditions are easier today than they were a year ago.\n\nThe stock market's up, credit spreads have narrowed, the dollar has weakened, and those have more than offset the effects of somewhat higher short-term rates and the very modest increases that we've seen in longer-term yields.\n\nPeter Boockvar of The Lindsey Group believes the Fed has set up a \"feedback loop\" where a strong stock market, which is is fueled by low rates, becomes a reason to hike rates (and reduce the Fed balance sheet, another form of tigheter monetary policy), which would cause a market sell-off. He writes Monday:\n\nMarkets have rallied themselves RIGHT INTO ANOTHER RATE HIKE assuming current conditions come December. Herein lies the Fed's conundrum, if markets sell off after QT, the market would sell itself AWAY FROM ANOTHER RATE HIKE.

Yet for all the attention I pay to the Fed, I \"know\" no better than anyone else whom President Trump will select when current Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's term ends in early February. It is simply too early to expect that President Trump has made a \"final\" decision, and a lot can change before announcements are made. (Few thought about Rex TillersonRex Wayne TillersonState Department quietly establishes new cybersecurity office Pentagon, State Department chiefs seek to soothe fears over North Korea The danger of ignoring Russian interference abroad MORE for secretary of State while Trump dined with Mitt Romney.)\n\nI prefer to build my views based on what President Trump has said, historical precedents and the administration's economic priorities. In a May interview with CNBC, Trump said Yellen \"not a Republican\" and that \"when her time is up, I would most likely replace her because of the fact that I think it would be appropriate.\"\n\nHe also said Yellen is \"a low interest rate person\" and \"let's be honest, I'm a low interest rate person.\" While contradictory on reappointing Yellen, on a deeper level they suggest that the president has clear criteria: Trump wants his Fed chairman to be a Republican, low interest rate person.\n\nThe choice of Fed chairman is inescapably political. Since the 1970s, every nominee has been chosen from the president's party. Yellen chaired President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, so her Democratic Party affiliation was no secret when she was selected by President Obama in 2013. Trump's disapproving reference to Yellen's party affiliation was likely intentional and in line with historical precedent.\n\nParty matters, but interest rate views may be even more crucial. The next Fed chairman will have to deal with many nuanced issues in monetary policy. How big should the Fed's balance sheet be? What parts of the regulatory landscape need changing? Should the Fed change its communication policy?\n\nThere are passionate, eminently qualified candidates on all sides of these important issues. Trump may have views as well. Yet the president is most likely to make his selection based on one thing he knows well: interest rates. Newly-elected presidents will do everything in their power to boost job growth and raise asset prices. However, Trump's emphasis on low interest rates may be especially important to promoting two of his priorities: infrastructure and manufacturing.\n\nFor infrastructure, the link between low interest rates and construction is obvious. Given the diminished prospects for Congress to increase public infrastructure funding, the president may be even more focused on the boost low interest rates can provide to private developers and builders.\n\nFor manufacturing, low domestic interest rates are commonly associated with a weaker U.S. dollar. This should benefit American manufacturing because it unambiguously improves the competitiveness of U.S. workers and products. Framed as a domestic issue, low interest rates may be less risky than tariffs, which are inherently international and could lead to retaliation.\n\nTrump is unlikely to choose any economist who advocates for higher interest rates (like John Taylor) regardless of political party or experience. Among the many other Republican candidates, some have taken principled stands on things like the size of the balance sheet (like Kevin Warsh) or the future of Fed communications (like Glenn Hubbard). While interesting, these issues are unlikely to be decisive. On interest rate policy, none of these candidates have expressed clear views, which could be a drawback from the president's perspective.\n\nTrump could reappoint Yellen, which he has hinted at a few times. She is a proven \"low interest rate person,\" despite falling short on the Republican end. While not a bad choice, and one financial markets may welcome for her steady dovish leadership, the president may think he can do better than Yellen and seek a Fed chairman who fits both his criteria. Gary Cohn, whose Republican affiliation is at best opportunistic, faces similar issues.\n\nOne candidate not on many radars is Jerome Powell, who has served as a Fed governor since 2012. A low interest rate person, he has consistently voted with the Fed majority to maintain accommodative policy. Powell is also an established Republican who worked in the Treasury Department under George W. Bush. More worthy candidates may emerge, but in the end, I believe President Trump will choose a Republican, low interest rate person for Fed chairman.\n\nJohn Bellows, Ph.D., is a portfolio manager and research analyst at Western Asset Management, an affiliate of Legg Mason.

cause Fed to tread cautiously", "uri": "710521642", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-16T12:05:00Z", "time": "12:05:00", "body": "Investing.com - As the countdown begins to the return of U.S. Congress to Washington on September 5, some experts have begun to question whether lawmakers' grappling over the $19.8 trillion debt ceiling could pose an obstacle the Federal Reserve in moving forward with policy normalization.\n\nEver since the $19.8 trillion limit was hit back in March, the government has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to shuffle money and continue funding until an agreement is reached, but the U.S. Treasury has suggested that the deadline for a definitive accord will arrive on September 29, a mere 12 working days after Congress returns to session.\n\nAlthough the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that deadline may be stretched a little longer, estimating that these measures will be exhausted and the government will not run out of cash until some point between October 3 and October 11, the Fed is scheduled for its next policy decision on September 20.\n\nThe uncertainty centers not just around a bipartisan deal being made, but also on the fact that the Republican majority is not fully united in its outlook.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers are considered to be strict fiscal hawks that insist on any debt ceiling increase being tied to either outright government spending cuts or, at the very least, a slower rate of spending.\n\n\"History tells us these events don't last long with politicians quickly realizing the need to get a bill passed,\" ING chief international economist James Knightley wrote in a report.\n\n\"Nonetheless, such a risk makes it likely that the Federal Reserve will tread carefully so a government shutdown would make a further rate rise this year look less likely,\" he warned.\n\n\"If the uncertainty builds in coming weeks, it could also mean that the Fed chooses to delay its balance sheet reduction strategy, although for now we still expect an announcement in September with an October start date,\" Knightley added.\n\nThe opinion mirrored remarks out from Fed vice-chairman Stanley Fischer on Wednesday who recognized his uncertainty over announcing the start of balance sheet reduction at the September meeting.\n\nFischer told the Financial Times in an interview that there was a threat of a congressional showdown over the debt ceiling, although he stated that \"in some deep sense people don't believe the Congress and the administration will allow the United States default on its debt.\"\n\nThe Fed vice-chairman further suggested that any market volatility was likely to be short-lived and noted that \"there is also a desire to say that we have some confidence that the system is pretty damn stable\".\n\nFischer added that there would likely be a break between the actual announcement of the balance sheet reduction and its start date, so the Fed could pause if any unanticipated circumstances arose.\n\nIn similar comments, New York Fed president William Dudley, a permanent voting member seen to be most aligned with Fed chair Janet Yellen, suggested last Monday that the market's prediction of the plan being announced in September were not \"unreasonable\".\n\nIn response to the issue of the debt ceiling, Dudley downplayed the situation, stating that it does \"not really\" pose difficulties for the Fed as it could choose to \"delay the actual start date\" of reducing the portfolio.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

Still, a majority of FOMC participants favor further rate increases. The July minutes showed an intensifying debate over whether that is the right policy response.\n\n\"These minutes to me were troubling,\" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC in New York. \"They don't have their confidence in their policy decisions; and they don't have confidence that they can provide the right kind of guidance.\"\n\nThe FOMC tried hard to avoid that kind of message.\n\nIn several passages, the minutes asserted that \"most\" officials were sticking with a forecast that higher inflation would eventually show up. However, the debate over resource slack models and whether standard data sources were telling them the whole story also showed convictions about their forecast are fraying.\n\nPrice indexes have shown unusual inertia even as the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen, matching a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in July.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index rose 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending July, while the Fed's preferred measure, which is tied to consumption, rose 1.4 percent in June. Another gauge calculated by the Dallas Fed, which trims index outliers to highlight the underlying price trend, rose 1.7 percent for the 12 months ending June. That was the same as May, which was down from 1.74 percent in April.\n\nThe minutes said \"a few\" officials described resource slack models as \"not particularly useful\" while \"most\" thought the framework was valid.\n\nThe committee also pondered a number of theories as to why inflation wasn't responding to tightening labor resources, such as \"the possibility that slack may be better measured by labor market indicators other than unemployment.\"\n\n\"It is a battle between data and theory,\" said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America Corp. in New York.\n\nIf there was a policy cue in the minutes, it was that the majority of the committee and some of its leaders maintain a low bar for further increases, Harris said.\n\nThat message was affirmed in an Associated Press interview with William Dudley, New York Fed president and vice chair of the FOMC, earlier this week. Dudley said he would be in favor of another rate hike later this year if growth holds up.\n\nThe minutes also included an unusual signal that someone -- possibly in the committee's leadership -- saw additional rate increases as striking the \"appropriate balance\" on policy goals, dedicating two sentences the views of \"one participant.\"\n\n\"That seems like an awful lot of air time as well as a very definitive answer coming from a mere 'one participant' -- unless that single person happened to be someone really important -- like, I don't know, maybe the Chair?,\" Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in New York, wrote in a note to clients, referring to Janet Yellen.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 265, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events/Business_and_Economy", "wgt": 100, "id": 266, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events/Business and Economy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 100, "id": 494, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferies_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302741", "label": {"eng": "Jefferies Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303074", "label": {"eng": "Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304013", "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304538", "label": {"eng": "Theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304539", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304655", "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305417", "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307047", "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "324974", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331578", "label": {"eng": "Financial economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "370505", "label": {"eng": "Inertia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_unemployment_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "379684", "label": {"eng": "List of U.S. states by unemployment rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Dallas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "408466", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "512435", "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}]}

Several members were ready to announce a start date at the July meeting, indicating a willingness to take the first step soon, possibly in September as many economists anticipate.\n\nThe Fed had previously said it would implement changes to its balance sheet \"relatively soon,\" provided the economy expands as expected. The central bank currently holds $4.5 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-related bonds, purchased to buoy U.S. growth after the financial crisis, and shedding some of them would likely tighten monetary conditions in the same way an interest-rate hike would.\n\nFed members also discussed concerns over inflation trends. Members said they could \"afford to be patient ... in deciding when to increase the federal funds rate further\" and that it was imperative to wait until \"incoming information confirmed that the recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist.\"\n\nThe central bank left the federal funds rate at 1% to 1.25% at that meeting, as widely expected. Another rate hike is not anticipated until at least December. Even then, chances of a year-end increase are only at 49.2%, according to CME Group fed funds futures.\n\n\"We know the Fed has a rate destination in mind, and a stated goal of three this year, but what remains to be seen is if they deliver this year or next,\" said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*TRADE. \"Many will be keeping a watchful eye on inflation. If we see improvement on that front, there's a good chance we'll see more action in 2017.\"\n\n2. -- Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) declined on Thursday morning after posting a decline in quarterly profit and sales.\n\nAdjusted earnings dropped 3%, while revenue declined 4%. Non-GAAP profit of 61 cents a share was in-line with estimates. Revenue of $12.13 billion came in $60 million higher than estimated. Sales have fallen for the past seven straight quarters in a row.\n\nBy segment, Cisco's core switching and routing businesses saw another quarter in decline, falling 9% year-over-year. Data center and collaboration fell 4% and 2%, respectively.\n\nCisco expects further drops in sales over its first quarter.

However, the debate over resource slack models and whether standard data sources were telling them the whole story also showed convictions about their forecast are fraying.\n\nPrice indexes have shown unusual inertia even as the US unemployment rate has fallen, matching a 16-year low of 4.3 per cent in July.\n\nThe US consumer price index rose 1.7 per cent for the 12 months ending July, while the Fed's preferred measure, which is tied to consumption, rose 1.4 per cent in June. Another gauge calculated by the Dallas Fed, which trims index outliers to highlight the underlying price trend, rose 1.7 per cent for the 12 months ending June. That was the same as May, which was down from 1.74 per cent in April.\n\nThe minutes said \"a few\" officials described resource slack models as \"not particularly useful\" while \"most\" thought the framework was valid.\n\nThe committee also pondered a number of theories as to why inflation wasn't responding to tightening labor resources, such as \"the possibility that slack may be better measured by labor market indicators other than unemployment.\"\n\n\"It is a battle between data and theory,\" said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America Corp. in New York.\n\nIf there was a policy cue in the minutes, it was that the majority of the committee and some of its leaders maintain a low bar for further increases, Harris said.\n\nThat message was affirmed in an Associated Press interview with William Dudley, New York Fed president and vice chair of the FOMC, earlier this week. Dudley said he would be in favor of another rate hike later this year if growth holds up.\n\nThe minutes also included an unusual signal that someone - possibly in the committee's leadership - saw additional rate increases as striking the \"appropriate balance\" on policy goals, dedicating two sentences the views of \"one participant.\"\n\n\"That seems like an awful lot of air time as well as a very definitive answer coming from a mere 'one participant' - unless that single person happened to be someone really important - like, I don't know, maybe the Chair?,\" Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in New York, wrote in a note to clients, referring to Janet Yellen.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 265, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/News/Current_Events/Business_and_Economy", "wgt": 100, "id": 266, "label": "dmoz/News/Current Events/Business and Economy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 100, "id": 494, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferies_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302741", "label": {"eng": "Jefferies Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303074", "label": {"eng": "Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304013", "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304538", "label": {"eng": "Theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304539", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304655", "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305417", "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "307045", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307047", "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "307974", "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310385", "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "324974", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331578", "label": {"eng": "Financial economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "362424", "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "370505", "label": {"eng": "Inertia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "395556", "label": {"eng": "The Straits Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Dallas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "408466", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas"}}]}

Dudley's term runs through 2021.\n\nIn Monday's comments, Dudley also said the Trump administration has been \"hands-off\" in terms of the Fed's deliberations about interest rates. \"They've been very respectful of the monetary policy, not to politicize the monetary policy process,\" he said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump said Yellen was manipulating monetary policy to favor former President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party, and that she had inflated a bubble in danger of collapsing.

What the then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke had characterized as a mere \"$50 billion problem\" morphed into a plunge in equity values with investors losing trillions of dollars, and a recession that caused unemployment to peak at 10 percent in October 2009.\n\nWhat have we learned a decade later? We found that as the Fed increased its holdings of bonds to $4.5 trillion -- more than five times the level at the onset of the financial crisis -- the additional liquidity boosted the financial markets to new heights. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which bottomed out at an intraday low of 667 in March 2009, now trades at about 2,445. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which some analysts had repeatedly predicted would surge to as much as 4 percent, is still well below the 2.5 percent mark. Equity multiples have risen with stock prices. For example, the S&P 500, which traded in November 2008 at just 11 times its trailing 12-month earnings, now trades at about 21 times.\n\nThe euphoria in the equities market isn't matched by the real economy. Gross domestic product growth has been lackluster -- very different from the strong recovery that followed the 1981-82 recession. Labor force participation rates are below pre-recession levels of 2007 rather than increasing as they have in past recoveries. The weakness of the recovery is especially evident in real wages. After falling sharply during the financial crisis, the pickup in real average weekly earnings has been weaker than normal, rising just 1.2 percent year over year.\n\nThe marked divergence between the performance of financial markets and the broader economy provides a window into the impact of economic and regulatory policies. The response to the economic crisis since 2008 has been focused on monetary easing to the almost total exclusion of tax reform, structural adjustments and measures to deregulate. Investors used the liquidity supplied by the Fed to bet on increases in equity prices and falling bond yields, while households sought out riskier assets such as high-yield bonds to escape the zero rates on bank deposits. There was little to aid the real economy.\n\nNow, with the elevated values of financial assets, it may be time to pay the piper. The Fed appears to recognize its role in the speculative run-up in financial asset prices based on Chair Janet Yellen's reference in June to \"somewhat rich\" valuations. The Fed has increased interest rates four times since December 2015, three of them since last December. Now there is a plan afoot to gradually pare the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet by not reinvesting some of the maturing bonds. This process could begin as early as October.\n\nWith the shift in Fed policy, investors face a dilemma. Although surging corporate earnings this year have provided support for the continued rise in share prices, a steady tightening of monetary policy would be a headwind. And if other measures -- on the fiscal, structural and regulatory fronts -- don't offset the negative impact of a restrictive monetary policy, those lofty equities valuations may no longer be justifiable, touching off a sharp correction. That, in turn, could push the economy into recession, once again increasing unemployment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is proud of the stock-market rally during the first few months of his administration, and he also wants to push GDP growth to 3 percent or more. For the rally to continue and for him to achieve the growth objective, his administration needs to focus on two major areas.\n\nThe first is deregulation. Although markets need regulations to function, in excess they get in the way of economic efficiency. Unfortunately, the Obama administration added thousands of pages of rules governing even simple transactions toward the end of its term. The Trump administration has reversed some of the more burdensome rules, though there is still a way to go.\n\nDeregulation would boost share prices of companies in energy and finance. For example, allowing more drilling on federal land will increase oil and gas production and create jobs. The financial sector could also continue to rally with well-designed rule changes. Although some of the post-financial crisis regulations to limit leverage were clearly justified, the pendulum has swung too far the other way, limiting bank lending to the private sector.\n\nThe second is taxes. Lowering corporate taxes to encourage investment spending, and offering employment tax credits to promote hiring, are other areas to focus on.\n\nAs the Fed reduces its asset holdings and keeps hiking rates, whether the rally persists will depend on the measures the administration does, or doesn't, implement in coming months.\n\nBloomberg Prophets Professionals offering actionable insights on markets, the economy and monetary policy.

Could you tell us, are you lowering it now, that his program is -- your own personal forecast -- are you lowering it given that his economic program is at the moment stalled? Any comments?\n\nWILLIAM DUDLEY: My outlook for the economy hasn't changed materially since the beginning of the year. Continue to look for growths around 2%, slightly above trend, growth sufficient to continue to tighten the labour market. I did not raise my growth forecast after the Election because of the prospect of fiscal stimulus because I felt that there was a lot of uncertainty about how big it would be, what its composition would be, and when it would actually take effect.\n\nSo, I always viewed it as a risk to the forecast. In other words, an upside risk to the forecast, but I never put it into my baseline forecast.\n\nI think we're still on the same trajectory we've been on for several years. Above trend growth, gradually tightening labour market, inflation -- somewhat below our objective -- but we do expect as the labour market continues to tighten, to see firmer wage gains and that will ultimately filter into inflation moving up towards our 2% objective.\n\nQ: What do you see as the evidence for the labour market tightening?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, I think you can see it just directly in the unemployment rate, 4.3%, that's the lowest unemployment rate we've had in many years. If you look at some of the broader measures of unemployment, they have also come down to levels that we reached prior to the great recession. So, a pretty broad range of evidence that suggests the labour market is quite a bit tighter than it's been in many years. Which is a good thing.\n\nQ: Sure. In an appearance last week you said that the inflation that you look at might not get back up to 2% for 6 to 10 months, just given ... Given that outlook, why be thinking of raising rates at all?\n\nDUDLEY: Well, the reason why inflation won't get up to 2% very quickly on a year-over-year basis is because we've had these very low inflation readings over the last 4 or 5 months. So it's going to take time for those to sort of drop out of the year-over-year calculation.\n\nBut I think if you look at inflation sequentially, in other words what's inflation likely to actually do over the next 6 months, I'm expecting somewhat higher readings than what we've had over the last 6 months.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 100, "id": 66, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 151, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100, "id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 100, "id": 480, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "wgt": 100, "id": 741, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 100, "id": 779, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303018", "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303889", "label": {"eng": "Wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304203", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304539", "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304617", "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305941", "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306679", "label": {"eng": "Risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307047", "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310990", "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment#Measurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311124", "label": {"eng": "Unemployment rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "329299", "label": {"eng": "Uncertainty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upside_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "450706", "label": {"eng": "Upside risk"}}]}

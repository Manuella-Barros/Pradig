[+] Spirits Awards Photo Illustration: Brad Japhe Last week, The Glen Grant made headlines when it announced that its legendary master distiller Dennis Malcolm would be retiring after 63 years in the whisky business. He certainly will be given his flowers as he bows out\u2014along with several casks of scotch, hopefully. And today, Scotland\u2019s longest-serving malt maker can count another going away present in the form of a significant industry accolade. The 2022 release of Glen Grant 21 has just been named \u201cBest In Show\u201d scotch at the third annual TAG Global Spirits Awards. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the $349 bottling, including where to find it. Originally released in early 2023, Glen Grant 21 Year Old is very much the brainchild of Mr. Malcolm. To craft it, he hand-selected a combination of casks that spent time in either 100% ex-Oloroso sherry butts, or in ex-bourbon barrels. All of the stock was plucked from the distillery\u2019s oldest dunnage warehouse in the historic whisky-making village of Rothes. The Glen Grant Master Distiller Dennis Malcom OBE Brad Japhe Malcolm opted for liquid that exudes tropical fruitiness in the nose and mid-palate, as well as a creamy confection to the mouthfeel. The small batches he married together result in a complex-yet-entirely-accessible dram. A whiff of peppered pineapple wafts from the 92-proof liquid as it enters the Glencairn. And there\u2019s more of that tongue-tickling fruit tang to follow in the first few sips. But as you slowly sit with it, there\u2019s ultimately a delightful creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e to ponder in this pour.

It\u2019s a higher score than any other scotch entered into this year\u2019s contest\u2014blended, single malt or grain. The release is part of The Glen Grant\u2019s Principal Collection, which is meant to showcase the signature style of the distillery\u2014light and fresh like a flower garden. These characteristics take on a meaningful sense of place for anyone fortunate enough to visit the hallowed grounds of the facility. A walking tour here traces the whisky\u2019s meandering water source to reveal a 22-acre botanical garden that was established by second generation distiller, \u201cMajor\u201d James Grant, back in 1886. Getting here, to the heart of Speyside, is an obligatory pilgrimage for any self-avowed scotch enthusiast. But while you\u2019re planning the journey, it\u2019s nice to know that you can gain a glimpse of it right in the comfort of your own living room, simply by uncorking a bottle of the award-winning Glen Grant 21. The iteration that took home the prize is a limited edition from 2022, so it\u2019s not exactly priced for everyday pours. You can still hope to find it in the range of $340-$440 from American retailers. It\u2019s certainly something worthy of sipping to celebrate retirement. Though Mr. Malcom might prefer a 63-year-old expression to suit his record-setting tenure. Follow along here for more \u201cBest In Show\u201d winners from this year\u2019s TAG Global Spirits Awards.

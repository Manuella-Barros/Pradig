Kuching South City Council (MBKS) mayor Dato Wee Hong Seng revealed that the project, estimated at below RM2 million, is currently at the final stage of planning, with designs ready. \u201cThe proposal will be put up at the park for residents to view and provide feedback. Once approved, the project will be tendered. \u201cHopefully it can commence and be completed within this year,\u201d he said after officiating a tree planting programme along Jalan Sherip Masahor today. Wee emphasised that the project is aimed at optimising the use of recreational parks as a space not only for exercising but also to enhance community and family bonding. \u201cToday\u2019s children are often stuck with their gadgets when staying at home while their parents are at work. \u201cWe hope with the proposed mini library, they can spend their time more meaningfully by reading and learning. We are also planning to engage retired teachers to guide the kids,\u201d he added. Acknowledging that initiatives to improve community spaces with better facilities and amenities require substantial funding, Wee expressed hope for more organisations and parties to help source for additional funding. Meanwhile, the tree planting programme saw the Council, in collaboration with Hui Sing Village Security and Development Committee (JKKK) and the Red Crescent Association Stampin Branch, planted 93 \u2018Happiness\u2019 trees, scientifically known as Garcinia subelliptica, along Jalan Sherip Masahor in an effort to enhance urban greenery. MBKS Deputy Mayor Dato Zaiedi Suhaili and Hui Sing JKKK chairman Kapitan Tan Gun Kee were among those present. \u2014 DayakDaily", "summary": "By Karen Bong KUCHING, June 29: Taman Hui Sing recreational park is set for another upgrade, including a proposed mini library to create a conducive space for children to encourage reading.

Ten were girls, two were boys. All the 10 girls were immediately suspended,\" he said.\n\nLesufi said the girls in the video were in grade nine. They were fighting over boys.\n\nHe said the school governing body met on Thursday night and recommended the two boys be expelled. They would be served with expulsion letters on Monday.\n\nThe video, which was posted on Tuesday, shows pupils in Norkem Park High School winter uniform surrounding what appear to be girls fighting and tugging each other's jerseys. A girl with a white bandana pushes a girl with dreadlocks to the ground.\n\nThe violence allegedly escalated when family members brought weapons and got involved in the fight, and when students formed gangs to protect themselves.\n\nA total of 18 pupils were identified as belonging to these gangs. They would face a disciplinary hearing over the weekend.\n\nHe said a pupil was caught with a bottle of vodka on the school premises on Friday morning. While he was in a meeting with the SGB, two pupils allegedly assaulted two teachers. Both pupils had been suspended and would face a disciplinary hearing over the weekend.\n\nLesufi wanted the school to appoint a permanent disciplinary committee until the situation had been brought under control.\n\nHe said various institutions and government would be needed to help with everything from academic work, discipline, alcohol and drug abuse, to the overall running of the school. He said he would not tolerate lawlessness at the school.\n\nLesufi did not want to comment on the alleged stabbing of a pupil with scissors earlier this week. It had not been confirmed yet.\n\nPupils would in future have to study with police on the school premises and they would conduct searches once a week.

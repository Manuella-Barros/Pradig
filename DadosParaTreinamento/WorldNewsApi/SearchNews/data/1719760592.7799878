Our thoughts go out to the other 35+ festivals who have already cancelled this year along with our hopes that we can collectively find a way to come back stronger one day.\u2019 The 2024 Towersey Festival will be its last due to \u2018economic challenges\u2019 (Picture: Towersey Festival) The caption added: \u2018After 60 incredible years, we\u2019re closing this chapter with the ultimate celebration. \u2018Your support has meant the world to us, and we want to make this last festival truly unforgettable.

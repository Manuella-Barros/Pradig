The handover by Hillsborough headquartered, Graham Construction will allow Legal & General Investment to progress with the internal fit-out of the building before the first residents move in later this summer. Developed by a joint venture between Drum Property Group and Stamford Investments, the 3.6-acre Candleriggs Square site is regarded by many as the last and most important piece of Glasgow\u2019s Merchant City regeneration jigsaw. Designed to meet the increasing demand for affordable and high-quality city centre rental accommodation in Scotland, the 325,000 sq. ft L&G scheme provides 346 apartments together with a range of retail and commercial units at ground floor level creating an attractive and accessible public realm. An entrance lobby opens onto Glasgow\u2019s Trongate, providing direct access to a communal landscaped courtyard at the first-floor level, while a range of roof terraces provide spectacular views across the city. The building\u2019s completion was marked by the release of drone footage showing how the finished homes form a spectacular cornerstone of the Candleriggs Square regeneration. Jimmy House, construction director at Graham Building North, said: \u201cStanding at 17 storeys at its highest point, Candleriggs Square will become a focal part of the city\u2019s skyline, reinstating the Merchant City as a destination of choice for people to live, work and socialise. \"The handover of the 346 BTR apartments represents an important milestone for the project, and we are pleased to have completed works ahead of schedule.\u201d Graeme Bone, Group managing director of Drum Property Group, explained: \u201cCandleriggs Square is now starting to come alive, fulfilling the development vision we outlined when we first took ownership of the site in 2019. With the completion of the L&G apartments and the opening of The Social Hub Glasgow, we are seeing this vital part of the city centre, which had lain dormant for more than 20 years, take shape in spectacular fashion. \u201cCandleriggs Square has always been at the centre of Glasgow\u2019s commercial and social development, and this completion will be a huge boost to the area and to local businesses. We can now positively look forward to bringing back to life a very special area which has always been at the centre of Glasgow\u2019s commercial and social development.\u201d Dan Batterton, head of residential at Legal & General Investment, added: \u201cWe are delighted to reach completion at Candleriggs Square, bringing a new community to the heart of the Merchant City. Helping to meet Glasgow\u2019s increasing demand for high-quality rental housing, the site offers a well-designed, flexible living space integrated within the broader regeneration of the city centre. We look forward to welcoming our first residents in the coming months.\"", "summary": "The project by Hillsborough\u2019s Graham will provide 346 apartments together with a range of retail and commercial units", "url": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/business/northern-ireland-construction-firm-delivers-practical-completion-of-ps815million-scheme-in-scotland-4658748", "image": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmQ0YTAyYWJiLWMwZGEtNDNmZC1hNDM4LTg4YTc2MDVlZmRjNzowNzQ1NTRiMS0wM2QzLTQ3ZTAtODNkMC01ZjhjY2NkMTFlN2U=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:16:28", "author": "Claire Cartmill", "authors": ["Claire Cartmill"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.576}

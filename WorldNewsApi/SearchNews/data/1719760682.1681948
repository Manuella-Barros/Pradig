Tusk said that a buffer zone about 660 feet wide would be set up along the border, which is also the European Union's eastern frontier, in addition to a 118-mile long metal barrier already in place to prevent an influx of migrants crossing from Belarus. Poland says the pressure of illegal migration is organized by Belarus and Russia. Tusk said the government will make a decision on the buffer zone next week. POLAND SIGNS $735M DEAL WITH US FOR SUPPLY OF MISSILES, DEFENSE MINISTER SAYS Tusk, together with the defense and interior ministers, visited troops, border guards and police forces securing the border following a knife attack on a soldier early Tuesday near the village of Dubicze Cerkiewne. Officials said the soldier remains hospitalized in serious condition. Officials said a migrant reached across the bars of the more than 16-foot high metal wall separating Poland and Belarus and stabbed the soldier in the ribs. Polish security forces were not able to detain the attacker because he was on the Belarus side of the barrier, officials said. \"There is no room for negotiation. Poland's border must be protected,\" Tusk said. \"Polish troops, border guards, officers have become the targets of aggression and you have every right, not to say an obligation, to use every means available to you ... when you are defending not only the border but also you own life,\" Tusk said.

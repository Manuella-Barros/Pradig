She spoke about her dating experiences in a 2022 Angie Martinez IRL podcast episode. Kardashian also discussed her nine-month relationship with her ex-boyfriend Pete Davidson with the show's presenter. After seven years of marriage, West and Kardashian formalized their divorce in November 2022. Kardashian had first filed for divorce in February 2021. According to HuffPost, Kardashian confessed on the podcast, \"There\u2019s a part of me that is like, \u2018Oh my God, is everyone gonna be scared because I don\u2019t have the easiest ex?\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair for me to ever put someone in a situation or bring a new person in who could be super innocent. Then there\u2019s a side of me that\u2019s like, \u2018Why would I ever have to live that way?\" Before the contracts were finalized, West spent many months trying to get Kardashian back. He supposedly gave her Valentine's Day roses and claimed to have found a laptop with a copy of her well-known sex tape with Ray J. Despite claiming to be afraid that West's fame may turn off possible suitors, Kardashian stated that she is enjoying her 'fun zone' as a single person. She went on to state, \"I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get married again, but I\u2019ll have my forever partner. I know that. He\u2019s coming, absolutely. I\u2019m at peace and I\u2019m gonna have fun until that happens.\" Comedian Pete Davidson was the first person Kardashian dated after her breakup with West. They started dating in October 2021 and ended their relationship in August 2022. Kardashian did not like how often West used social media to criticize Davidson throughout their relationship. During the same year in March, for his song 'Eazy,' the rapper unveiled a new music video in which an animated Ye was seen kidnapping and beheading a person who looked a lot like Davidson. The gruesome film ends with the Davidson doppelganger being buried alive and doused with rose seeds that sprout from his skull in a different scenario. After that, the video ends with a menacing message addressed to 'Skete,' the alias Ye has used to refer to Davidson. As per Salon, the message read, \"EVERYONE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER / EXCEPT SKETE YOU KNOW WHO / JK HE'S FINE.\" Only a few hours after Kardashian was ruled legally single in a bifurcation hearing, this monochromatic music video with The Game was released. At the time, the rapper accused Kardashian of keeping him from seeing his kids and insulted her regularly. As per US Magazine, he shared on his Instagram, \"I want to bring my kids to my home town of Chicago to see my basketball team play for 7 thousand people. Kim is stopping that, how is this joint custody? My solace comes from seeing my kids and getting a solid schedule. That\u2019s why I even got the house [next to Kim\u2019s.\" Ye also made fun of Kardashian's relatives on social media as well. When images of Kardashian and Davidson appeared on social media, the online rants intensified on Twitter and Instagram.", "summary": "<img alt=\"When Kim Kardashian Was Worried For &#39;Future Boyfriends&#39; Because Kanye West Was Not The &#39;Easiest Ex&#39;\" src=\"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/698229/uploads/3202e2c0-24c2-11ef-9120-d3ce923faad2_800_420.jpeg\" />\n                Kim Kardashian said, &#34;I didn&#39;t know what dating was for so long,&#34; during\u00a0a podcast\u00a0of\u00a0Angie Martinez IRL.", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/when-kim-kardashian-was-worried-for-future-boyfriends-because-kanye-west-was-not-the-easiest-ex", "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/698229/uploads/3202e2c0-24c2-11ef-9120-d3ce923faad2_1200_630.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:45:01", "author": "INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey", "authors": ["INQUISITR", "Priyanka Pandey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.093}

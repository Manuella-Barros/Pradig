Thankfully, Detroit made at least some effort to address it by signing Marcus Davenport, who will hopefully give some help to Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nHowever, Davenport is on a one-year deal and the 27-year-old is coming off a season in which he played in just four games due to injury. And, injury issues have been a concern his whole career.\n\nDavenport and Hutchinson have the potential to make up a potent one-two punch, but if either player misses time, the Lions are going to have a problem, which is why it was so important for Detroit to add multiple impact edge rushers.\n\nWhile Pro Football Network's Dakota Randall was a fan of the Lions bolstering their secondary, he rightly points out that EDGE remains the Lions' biggest need.\n\nThe Detroit Lions couldn't have done a better job of filling their cornerback holes during the draft. But Dan Campbell and company came up empty at edge rusher.\n\nDetroit ranked 23rd in the league with 41 sacks last season.

Which opponent are you hoping is first for the Lions in 2024?\n\nChristian Booher: I'd like to see the Lions match up with a divisional opponent early in the year. Specifically, I'd like to see the Lions match up with either the Bears or the Vikings. My reasoning is simple, the Lions would benefit from matching up with one of the division's young quarterbacks early as they will likely require time to adapt at the NFL level.\n\nIt'd also be exciting for the Lions to play in a primetime slot to open the year. They took advantage of being on the national stage last season, so it'd be fun to watch Dan Campbell's group in that environment once again.\n\nVito Chirco: There are a few teams I believe would produce an appetizing season-opening matchup (i.e. Green Bay and Kansas City). But, I'm going to go with the San Francisco 49ers, setting up a rematch of the NFC Championship Game in Week 1. I don't think it could get much better than the Lions getting revenge against the 49ers to kick off the season.\n\n2.) What are you hoping to learn about at Lions rookie minicamp?\n\nBooher: It will be interesting to monitor rookie minicamp for a couple reasons. For one, it'll be the first time players such as Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw are in action with the team. Additionally, there will be undrafted free agents competing for roster spots.\n\nIt will be interesting to learn more about the plans that the team has for players like Arnold, Rakestraw and Mekhi Wingo. Additionally, I am intrigued to hear Dan Campbell's thoughts on how the offense will utilize Sione Vaki.\n\nChirco: I'm hoping to learn more about the mindsets of the players from the Lions' 2024 draft class. Do they have the mental fortitude and toughness and grit to mesh with the rest of Detroit's roster? I'm hoping to glean that from the team's upcoming rookie minicamp.\n\nAlso, I'm looking to further hear from Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw on how they believe they'll fit in Aaron Glenn's defense. I believe we're going to get some interesting soundbites from Detroit's new cornerback duo.\n\n3.) What are your expectations for Marcus Davenport in 2024?\n\nBooher: My expectations for Davenport are modest. For starters, to have him healthy for a majority of the year would be excellent for the roster. I think if he remains healthy, he could approach double-digit sacks.\n\nRegardless, Davenport should have a moderate amount of success in a Lions uniform, as he'll get plenty of opportunities opposite Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nChirco: I'm expecting Davenport to suit up for at least 11 games in 2024 and to be a decent contributor to Detroit's EDGE-rushing efforts. I think he'll record three sacks and eight quarterback hits and be a solid rotational player at the EDGE position.\n\n4.) How many primetime games will the Lions get scheduled in 2024?\n\nBooher: I think the Lions will be allotted the maximum of five primetime games this season. They are national darlings and among the most popular teams in the league, so they'll always draw big ratings. As a result, the team will be coveted for primetime slots.\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of games on the team's schedule that would generate major interest. Among their opponents are Buffalo, Houston and rematches with each of their three opponents. Any of those games would be interesting for viewers on the national stage.\n\nChirco: Well, last year during the schedule release, the Lions were given five primetime games, including the NFL kickoff game with the Chiefs and Thanksgiving Day. So, I'm going to go with five again (with a chance for more), especially coming off a banner season for the Lions in 2023.\n\n5.) Which second-year Lions player will make the biggest leap in 2024?\n\nBooher: I think Jack Campbell will take the biggest leap. I was very encouraged by what I saw from him to end the season last year, so I think he's a breakout candidate in 2024.\n\nIf not Campbell, I think Antoine Green could have a bigger role in the offense this year. The Lions have done little to fortify their receiving depth, so he could certainly be a factor in the unit next year.\n\nChirco: I would love to say Jack Campbell, because the verdict is still out on the second-year linebacker. But actually I'm going to go with defensive back Brian Branch, Detroit's second-of-two second-rounders in last year's draft. He was already a very solid rookie, lining up at nickel corner and performing quite well. But now with a revamped cornerbacks room, I could see Branch shifting over to safety and absorbing the role of ex-Lions DB C.J. Gardner-Johnson in Detroit's secondary. I think he'll be more than fine in that role, too, which might morph into a cornerback-safety hybrid role for Branch. And I strongly believe he'll make a jump in his second year as a pro.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vito_chirco@si.com",

They were toward the bottom of the league with 41 sacks during the regular season, though a late surge (18 over the final six weeks, nine sacks in the playoffs) should be noted.\n\nIn free agency, Marcus Davenport was added to the edge rusher mix. He has two or fewer sacks in three of the last four seasons though, as injuries have taken him off the field regularly. Last season with the Vikings, he played in just four games. While the Lions look like a really good landing spot for him, counting on Davenport for much of anything feels foolish.\n\nThe Lions will have James Houston returning to health after an ankle injury derailed his 2023 season. Josh Paschal, if healthy, has potential to be a difference maker off the edge. Last season's CFL sack leader, Mathieu Betts, is an interesting flier.\n\nIf that sounds like an awful lot of hypotheticals and 'ifs' for edge rusher production outside of Aidan Hutchinson, not too unlike last season, it's not your imagination. The group outside of Hutchinson (Charles Harris, Romeo Okwara) was ripe for offseason turnover, but it hasn't fully come.\n\nSo it's fair to wonder if the Lions will circle back to the free agent market after the draft to add an edge rusher. Maybe they won't, as Mike Payton of AtoZ Sports suggested. But there's also a case for that spot being the biggest weakness on their roster now.\n\nHere are five free agent edge rushers who should be on the Lions' radar, if they are looking.\n\nA third-round pick by the Arizona Cardinals in 2022, Sanders is looking for his third NFL team in as many seasons. The Cardinals waived him off IR early last season and the Houston Texans claimed him. He had zero sacks in seven games for Houston last year, and they waived him in April after they added to their defensive line.\n\nOver his final three seasons in college at Cincinnati, Sanders had 13.5 sacks and 24.5 tackles for loss. That potential should still be there at 25 years, even with a less than ideal start to his NFL career.\n\nSanders stands out as a \"sign him, give him an opportunity and promise him nothing\" flier for someone. The Lions could at least do that, in the name of added competition in the edge rusher mix.", "source": {"uri": "sidelionreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SideLion Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_rusher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edge rusher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Davenport", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Davenport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Paschal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Paschal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathieu Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_Okwara", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romeo Okwara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davenport, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davenport, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2440,h_1372,x_0,y_912/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/53/01hwzk4a1wyrgtavdhhb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540805", "eventUri": "eng-9540805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

As expected, the Detroit Lions have a late first-round pick in any early 2025 mock you'll see, a predictor of them getting back to the level of success they had last season. And frankly, there are multiple possible directions they could go with that first pick a year from now.\n\nAs the post-draft dust settles, the Lions could look to make a veteran addition (if only for depth/competition) at a few spots. Wide receiver, safety and edge rusher are the spots that stand out, perhaps the first two more than the third.\n\nThe Lions were tied for 23rd in sacks last season with 41 sacks. Aidan Hutchinson had 11.5, followed by defensive tackle Alim McNeill with 7.5 sacks in his breakthrough season. No other edge rusher, sans Hutchinson, had more than two sacks.\n\nMarcus Davenport was signed to a one-year deal in free agency, but he has two or fewer sacks in three of the last four seasons due to injuries. The return to health of James Houston will help, but it's hard to know what he'll do.\n\nSo a long-term running mate for Hutchinson stands to be on the radar heading toward the 2025 draft, and that's been the common theme in early mocks.\n\nSo, getting down to specific players, who do early mock drafters have the Lions taking next April?\n\nJordan Reid of ESPN and Marcus Mosher of The 33rd Team have the Lions taking Louisville edge rusher Ashton Gillotte and No. 29 overall.\n\nReid: The Lions want some pass-rush help opposite Aidan Hutchinson, and if you enjoyed watching Missouri's Darius Robinson (Cardinals first-rounder) during this past draft cycle, you'll love Gillotte. His game similarly revolves around power. At 6-3 and 275 pounds, he packs a strong punch, helping him to 13 tackles for loss and 11 sacks last season. But can he expand his pass-rush skill set behind his raw strength?\n\nMosher: The Detroit Lions are still searching for a long-term bookend to pair with Aidan Hutchinson, and they could get one here with Ashton Gillotte from Louisville. Leading the ACC in sacks with 11, Gillotte was a force during the 2023 season. During the past two seasons, he's recorded 22.5 tackles for a loss and 18 sacks. Another strong season should firmly plant him in the first round.\"\n\nPro Football Focus has the Lions taking Ohio State edge rusher JT Tuimolau, also at pick No. 29, in their early 2025 mock.\n\nThe Lions didn't select an edge defender in theeven though they can upgrade at the spot opposite ofAidan Hutchinson. Tuimoloau has been frustratingly inconsistent (74.5 grade in 2023) but has first-round tools and flashes dominance (see: 2022 tape against Olu Fashanu and Penn State).\"\n\nEric Froton of NBC Sports has the Lions going with Texas A&M edge rusher Nic Scourton (pick No. 28).\n\n\"Scourton (6-4, 260 pounds) recorded 42 pressures, 32 stops and a laudable 21.3% third-down pressure rate to go with his 10.0 sacks for Purdue. This season he will be taking his 91st% PFF pass rush grade to Texas A&M where he faces off against the best tackles the SEC has to offer. He would give Detroit another monster edge defender opposite Aidan Hutchinson.\"\n\nRob Rang of Fox Sports has the Lions, at pick No. 28, taking Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter.\n\n\"Ever since James Franklin took over at Penn State, the Nittany Lions have churned out edge rushers and all indications are that Carter is next. Even while splitting duties with 2023 top-100 draft picks Chop Robinson and Adisa Isaac, the 6-foot-3, 250-pound Carter earned first-team All-Big Ten honors with 5.5 tackles for loss, including 4.5 sacks.\"\n\nIn other early 2025 mocks (h/t to NFL Mock Draft Database), Florida's Prince Umanmielen, Ohio State's Jack Sawyer, Oklahoma State's Collin Oliver, Arkansas' Landon Jackson are other edge rushers who land with the Lions. That's the broad theme, and it's well-founded even looking so far ahead.", "source": {"uri": "sidelionreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SideLion Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

{"uri": "8111164393", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-04", "time": "13:44:24", "dateTime": "2024-05-04T13:44:24Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-04T13:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.si.com/nfl/lions/schedule-release-things-to-watch-lions", "title": "10 Things to Anticipate When Lions Schedule Released", "body": "Stafford's return, primetime games headline what to watch for in 2024.\n\nThe NFL has turned its schedule release into an annual event, which helps to drum up excitement for the season.\n\nOn Friday, the league announced that the reveal is coming in May. Over the last two seasons, the release comes on the second Thursday of the month. However, no official date has been announced.\n\nThe season opener is on plenty of minds, as the Lions will hope to recapture their magic from last year. They played in the first game of the season in 2023, defeating the defending champion Chiefs on national television last season.\n\nThe Lions and Chiefs won't play each other, so rule the Lions out of that season-opener. However, there's still plenty of enticing matchups on the slate for next year that would generate buzz for Detroit. Could they notch one of the Sunday or Monday primetime slots in Week 1? It's hard to argue with the ratings they produced in their primetime games.\n\nHow many primetime games?\n\nSpeaking of primetime, the Lions will likely be featured plenty on national TV. With their Week 16 game against Denver being flexed, they wound up playing five regular season primetime games last season.\n\nOf those primetime games, they lost just one, their trip to Dallas in the penultimate game of the year. As a result, they'll be a hot commodity for the national slates. Matchups with Dallas, Houston, San Francisco as well as all of the divisional matchups are early leaders for the Lions to be in primetime slots.\n\nRematch with 49ers\n\nThe Lions will surely have their return trip to San Francisco circled on their calendar when it is announced. Detroit has the ability to get revenge for their NFC Championship game loss at Levi's Stadium, which would feel good even though the stakes won't be the same.\n\nDetroit dominated the first half of their meeting in January, but the 49ers charged back in the third quarter and wound up surviving to punch their ticket to the Super Bowl. That left a sour taste in the locker room, one they're likely excited to avenge when they get the opportunity.\n\nTrips to Texas\n\nThe Lions will take separate trips to Texas this season to play Dallas and Houston. Neither will be a easy one for Detroit. For starters, AT&T Stadium has been a house of horrors for the Lions, especially with the infamous penalties that have cost the team wins in that building in the past.\n\nHouston, meanwhile, appears to be going all-in based on their moves this offseason. It's a smart decision given the fact that they have their quarterback of the future, C.J. Stroud, on a rookie contract.\n\nWho is Thanksgiving opponent?\n\nThe Lions' annual tradition of playing on Thanksgiving has been a tough one for the team as of late. Even with all of the success the team had last season, they lost on Thanksiving for the seventh straight time.\n\nDetroit dropped to 4-17 on the holiday since 2004, extending a long stretch of struggles on that specific date. Time will tell whether they snap the skid this season, so seeing their opponent for the holiday will offer fans a first look about what could happen this time around.\n\nMatchups with rookie QBs\n\nThe Lions could see two first-round quarterbacks this season, and potentially both twice. Caleb Williams will be the Bears' starter, and J.J. McCarthy will compete with Sam Darnold to be Minnesota's starter.\n\nWilliams is viewed as an elite prospect, while McCarthy has strong intangible traits and a winning mentality. The Lions have the chance to give them a tough welcome to the division when they meet this season.\n\nStafford's return, part II\n\nTechnically, the home game the Lions have scheduled against the Rams won't be the first time Matthew Stafford will take the field in visiting colors. However, the circumstances will be different from the last time these two teams met in the Wild Card Round last year.\n\nOnce again, it will be interesting to see how Stafford is received from the Ford Field faithful. In the postseason matchup, he was booed loudly and met with chants supporing Detroit quarterback Jared Goff. The heightened stakes could've played a big part in that, but time will tell how the fans respond this time around.\n\nCan Lions solve Seattle curse?\n\nFor the third straight season, the Seattle Seahawks will come to Ford Field. It'll be the fourth year in a row that the two teams have met, with the 2021 meeting taking place in Seattle. Each of the three previous meetings have gone the way of the Seahawks.\n\nWhen these two teams have taken the field, outlandish games have ensued. Seattle under Pete Carroll seemed to have Detroit's number, so it remains to be seen if Mike Macdonald has the same answers. Still, Geno Smith has lit up the Lions over the last two seasons, so Aaron Glenn's defense will need to find answers.\n\nCold weather games (or lack thereof)\n\nBecause the Lions play in a dome, they avoid the cold weather for half the season to begin with. This year, however, they will spend a vast amount of their time in the warm weather. Of their eight road games this year, only two will be played outside.\n\nThose two games are their divisional opponents, Chicago and Green Bay. As a result, they will only play outside in the cold weather if those matchups are late in the year. Last year, the Lions struggled in a December trip to Chicago, while they went to Green Bay in Week 4.\n\nUniform schedule and release video\n\nThough it may not be released right with the schedule, NFL teams have made a habit of announcing when they'll wear they're alternate jerseys. As a result, the Lions could reveal when they'll debut the alternate black jerseys when the schedule comes out.\n\nThe Lions will be rocking a new look for the 2024 campaign. If the organization were to announce the new black uniforms debuting during a primetime game, it would likely excite the fan base.\n\nAnother exciting part of the annual release is the creativity in which teams announce their games. Last year, the Lions used AI voices to commentate over Madden highlights. How the social team elects to do it this year will be exciting.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_maakaron@si.com", "name":

And yours. And the city's. And the region's, the league's, the country's.\n\nHe was talking about what the Lions had just done. Mostly, he was talking about what was possible. And what it will take to achieve that possibility.\n\nIt's not so hard to imagine now: What a Super Bowl appearance would feel like, look like, vibe like.\n\nIt's not even so hard to imagine Campbell holding the Lombardi Trophy as confetti rains down in New Orleans or California.\n\nCARLOS MONARREZ: Lions' NFL draft haul puts the pressure on Aaron Glenn: Don't hold this team back\n\nLast month's draft in Detroit made this even easier to picture: When some 275,000 people crammed into Campus Martius on opening night and roared when the Lions selected Terrion Arnold; when the Alabama cornerback took the stage, noise swelling from the canyon of skyscrapers, and delivered the words so many had been waiting for ...\n\n\"Y'all got a star.\"\n\nArnold's presence before that ocean of (mostly) Honolulu blue gave us a glimpse of what a championship celebration might look like, of what the city might feel like.\n\nAgain, in Campbell's words: \"Now your eyes are open.\"\n\nBefore that run to the NFC title game, before last month's draft, it all felt unfathomable -- almost unknowable, not to mention unreal. But fortunes change. Realities change. Perceptions change. The Lions and the city they've represented for 90 years are both changing them.\n\nIt happens quickly, and similarly. Call it the power of word-of-mouth. There is social science behind this, but first, how about some anecdotal reminders. Let's start with the Lions, who began to turn heads two seasons ago with a 2022-season-ending win over Green Bay on a Sunday night.\n\nThe Lions missed the playoffs despite finishing 9-8. But the way they ended it mattered. Not only did they win eight of their final 10 games, they won their last game, knocking Aaron Rodgers from the playoffs, too.\n\nTHE NEW GUY: Detroit Lions CB Terrion Arnold and the many lives he has touched: 'He's one of my heroes'\n\nThe drama unfolded on national television. NFL fans could see the offensive line play, the run game, Jared Goff's ascension, and, of course, Campbell -- sporting a black baseball cap, his cheeks and nose ruddy -- prowling the sideline.\n\nAnd when he spoke to an NBC reporter between the first and second quarters and was asked what was motivating the team -- they'd found out right before kickoff of their elimination from the playoffs -- Campbell delivered the words so many had been waiting for ...\n\nHere was a coach to pay attention to. Here was a team that seemed to play like their coach spoke. Here was a franchise that might be on to something.\n\nEight months later, the Lions opened the 2023 season by knocking off the Chiefs in Kansas City, then kept winning. The chatter grew louder by the week. Detroit had a team worthy of respect. The team was interesting -- at times exciting -- and though NFL fans outside of our region aren't fully familiar with the decades of heartache, they knew enough to know the Lions' awesome autumn had been a long time coming.\n\nIt was surprising and endearing. The Lions earned that endearment. And while it helps when broadcasters are singing the praises of Campbell and Goff and Amon-Ra St. Brown and Penei Sewell and Brad Holmes, nothing replaces seeing for yourself.\n\nSuddenly, the Lions were on national television later than 3:30 p.m. on Thanksgiving, all the way through that thrilling (but gut-wrenching) finale against the San Francisco 49ers. It's the difference between an ad telling you a cup of coffee is great and your taste buds telling you that same thing.\n\nJust two months after that loss, the draft had a similar effect on the perception of the city. Stories from national publications can detail policy and economic change, they can lay out real estate booms and restaurant openings and they can write about improved street lighting, say, or reimagined waterfronts. And those stories matter.\n\nYet nothing is as powerful as a visitor from Pittsburgh, say, or Miami, spending a few days here and then telling their family or friends or neighbors about their experience when they return home.\n\nWhere that leads is hard to say -- Detroit isn't looking to become the South Beach of the Midwest. But perceptions can lead to more national sporting events, for example, or more conventions, or even more business, which means more jobs.\n\nIf the right person has the right experience, then maybe next time someone says, \"Hey, let's open something in Detroit.\" For better and for worse, ours is a system that pits cities and regions against each other for economic resources.\n\nAnd since social-science studies find that sporting events can change perceptions of a city, well, why not more of them?\n\nStudy after study shows that city image is critical in this economic battle. Nearly 800,000 people spent time downtown during the draft. Most, obviously, were from Michigan. But tens of thousands were not, and their impression can spread exponentially.\n\nNothing is a substitute for seeing, for witnessing. No wonder the buzz still hovers. Detroit had a moment in a way it hadn't for decades. Just as the Lions did.\n\nLike Campbell said, now our eyes are open. More importantly, now others' eyes are opening, too. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThe Lombardi Trophy sure seems like one of them, now more than ever.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors":

There's also a slight chance Arnold will work out of the slot if the Lions want to move Brian Branch to safety, so Arnold has multiple avenues to start in Year 1.\n\nLike Arnold, Rakestraw has inside/outside versatility and could potentially start from either spot. His best chance to play might come in tandem with the Lions moving Branch out of the slot. In that scenario, Rakestraw would work over the middle and Arnold would start on the outside. However, if it comes down to Rakestraw and Arnold on the boundary, the edge goes to the latter.\n\nMahogany was tremendous value in the sixth round and should be ready to contribute sooner rather than later, and likely sooner than fourth-round pick and fellow offensive lineman Giovanni Manu will be (more on that shortly). Detroit doesn't have any starting spots available upfront, but Mahogany could see snaps if either guard gets injured, or if Frank Ragnow gets injured and Graham Glasgow moves to center.\n\nWhile I don't think Vaki is going to see many (if any) snaps on offense or defense, depending on where the Lions play him (running back or safety), he should play on both sides of special teams and may even work his way into a returner role.\n\nThe Lions have two very good starters and some solid depth pieces on the. Wingo was great value in the sixth round but his snaps will be extremely limited on defense, if he gets any at all.\n\nManu was billed as an offensive tackle coming out, and while he may very well end up there when it's all said and done, he revealed that the Lions are planning on playing him at guard to start. Such a transition is going to take time, which means we may not see him upfront at all in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlton Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Glasgow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graham Glasgow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ragnow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Ragnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-04/GettyImages-1779524271.jpg?itok=vum5-Q0H", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540805", "eventUri": "eng-9540805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Lucky for Brad Holmes and Dan Campbell, the organization has plenty of young talent.\n\nHere are five breakout candidates for the Lions in the 2024 NFL season.\n\nWR Jameson Williams\n\nWilliams is in the midst of a pivotal offseason for his future as a Lion. The Lions will have to decide on his fifth-year option around this time next year, so he needs to put together a solid campaign in 2024.\n\nAfter having his first two offseasons interrupted, he's fully healthy and appears to be set for his first NFL season. Through two seasons, he has played just 18 games, or one game more than the equivalent of one full season.\n\nThough the overall numbers are lackluster, Williams ended last season on a high note with two touchdowns in the NFC Championship game. He has game-breaking speed and will be a threat to score every time he touches the ball. As a result, a full offseason of work could vault him into a role that will allow him to flourish.\n\nLB Jack Campbell\n\nOf Detroit's first four Draft picks, it took Campbell the longest to assert himself in a starting role. However, he finished the season strong and appeared capable of being a force in the middle of the defense moving forward.\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising to see Campbell take over the Lions' MIKE position at the second level, with Alex Anzalone playing the WILL spot. The Iowa product will have the full offseason and gained plenty of valuable experience down the stretch.\n\nDetroit clearly had high expectations for the defender when it selected him 18th overall. As a result, he could be due to take a big leap in his second NFL campaign.\n\nS Ifeatu Melifonwu\n\nMelifonwu took advantage of his first major NFL opportunity last season, his third NFL campaign. Now, in the final year of his rookie deal, he'll enter the year as the starter at safety. As a result, he has a chance to put together a full season of solid production.\n\nThe Syracuse product showed plenty of talent in his first extended stretch of major playing time last year. He displayed a knack for blitzing, which brought a much-needed change of pace to the Lions' defense.\n\nThere's plenty to like about his abilities and his fit within Detroit's defense. As a result, it will be exciting to monitor his production throughout the 2024 season.\n\nCB Amik Robertson\n\nThe Lions made several additions at cornerback this offseason, and Robertson may be the most intriguing. He's undersized to play the boundary corner position, but possesses a mean-streak and physicality that allows him to succeed in this area.\n\nRobertson should earn significant playing time in some capacity, whether it be inside as the slot corner or on the outside. He has four career interceptions, and with Detroit's heavy man-to-man style he could have the ability to increase that number significantly.\n\nThere will be plenty of competition in Detroit's secondary, which will bring out the best in all parties. Robertson could wind up being an excellent addition to the group.\n\nEDGE James Houston\n\nHouston had an excellent rookie campaign, but has yet to play a full year. Last year could've been his breakout, but he suffered an ankle injury that kept him out for much of the season.\n\nIf the pass-rusher can put together a full campaign, he should work wonders for a defense that struggled to produce sacks last season. He has exceptional bend around the edge and is quick to the passer, so he will be a nice pass-rush specialist at the very least.\n\nIf Houston can also develop into the team's SAM linebacker and get more consistent playing time, he'll put up big numbers for the team this season.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_booher@si.com", "name": "Christian Booher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Campbell_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Campbell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifeatu_Melifonwu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ifeatu Melifonwu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Anzalone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Anzalone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Houston_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Houston (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amik_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amik Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-to-man_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Man-to-man defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_Orange_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syracuse Orange football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2746,h_1544,x_0,y_936/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx49xyj5jpkzn3p7ff", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540805", "eventUri": "eng-9540805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

This will give the coaching staff a first look at what they have in this year's crop after months of extensive evaluations.\n\nThe crop includes Terrion Arnold, Ennis Rakestraw, Giovanni Manu, Sione Vaki, Mekhi Wingo, Christian Mahogany and a slew of undrafted free agents. The result will be an interesting three days where players can make strong impressions with their new coaches.\n\nA tackle at the collegiate level, Manu is reportedly set to take reps at guard for the Lions moving forward. Given that the Lions have young guard depth on roster from last season, it could set up for an interesting position battle throughout training camp.\n\nMinicamp should start to give the Lions an impression of how ready to go Manu will be heading into training camp for his rookie year. It will be an adjustment in a number of ways, as he is going to be learning a new position at the highest level of competition.\n\nManu won't be pressured to start right away, but this week should provide a helpful benchmark about where he needs to improve heading into training camp. While it will likely be mainly install and positional drills, the Lions staff will get their first opportunity to evaluate Manu's trajectory going forward.\n\nInside or outside for Arnold, Rakestraw?\n\nWith so many new faces at the cornerback position this year, the Lions will have to find ways to best allocate all of their new talent. Two of these newcomers, rookies Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw, will get their first opportunities to learn the scheme beginning this week.\n\nThe Lions' plethora of new talent gives them different options. Both Arnold and Rakestraw have the ability to play either in the slot as the nickel or on the boundary as a traditional cornerback. This week, Aaron Glenn and his staff should begin to evaluate which option suits each player best.\n\nBoth of these cornerbacks have the necessary physicality to be solid fits in the defensive scheme. The team should greatly benefit from that, as it will allow them to experiment with these players in different areas.\n\nAs a result, the coaching staff should treat the week of rookie minicamp as an exploratory one, seeing which of the two demonstrates the best fit in either cornerback spot.\n\nWho will be next training camp standout?\n\nA fun storyline to follow through the team offseason workouts are the annual rising stars. Each fall, teams deal with undrafted rookies or other unknown players who steal the spotlight and make compelling cases to make the final roster.\n\nIn recent years, the Lions have had several undrafted rookies make the roster and wind up playing significant roles. Additionally, there have been multiple players who were among the final cuts after strong training camp performances.\n\nAn interesting aspect of rookie minicamp is that it also allows players to earn roster spots for training camp. There are several players who will get the chance to do so for the Lions, including Grand Valley State quarterback Cade Peterson, Northern Iowa quarterback Theo Day and Hillsdale running back Michael Herzog.\n\nLast year, Dylan Drummond earned a roster spot after being a minicamp invite and nearly cracked the roster. Could yet another undrafted rookie put pressure on the staff when training camp comes around?

Detroit's secondary was by far the weakest position group on the team and arguably in the entire NFL. The Lions rolled into the NFC Championship with Cameron Sutton and Kindle Vildor as their starting outside cornerbacks. Cameron Sutton was cut earlier this offseason, which left the cornerback room needing a complete redo. GM Brad Holmes wasted no time addressing the positing during free agency. The team traded for Carlton Davis III from Tampa Bay and signed Amik Robertson away from the Raiders. They followed that up by picking Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. with their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nIt's hard to argue with Detroit's first two draft picks because they filled a critical area of need for the team. However, some of Detroit's mid-round picks are more questionable. Here are three draft mistakes from the Detroit Lions in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nDid the Lions spend too much to trade up for Terrion Arnold?\n\nThe Lions traded up from 29th overall to select Terrion Arnold at pick 24. Much of the problem with this move is how expensive it was to trade up five picks, as well as who was still available at that time.\n\nDetroit traded a third-round pick (73rd overall) to move up and get Arnold. At the time, Quinyon Mitchell was the only cornerback off the board. It seemed like regardless of who Detroit's top cornerback was, somebody would fall into their lap at 29.\n\nThe following cornerbacks were available at pick 29 and selected before Detroit came back on the clock at 61: Nate Wiggins, Kool-Aid McKinstry, Cooper DeJean, Kamari Lassiter, Max Melton, and Mike Sainristil. Wiggins, McKinstry, or DeJean would have been excellent picks at 29.\n\nIt's hard to fully compare trade scenarios until a couple of seasons have passed. However, we can look at who would have been on the board in the third round if Detroit had not decided to trade up. The Cowboys picked Cooper Beebe at 73, a pick that would have been welcome in Detroit. Another guard, Christian Haynes, could have also been the pick and went to Seattle at 81. If the Lions wanted an edge rusher, both Bralen Trice and Jonah Elliss were available.\n\nUltimately, if Arnold becomes a CB1 in Detroit then nobody will care about the third-round pick.\n\nGiovanni Manu is an expensive project pick\n\nManu is a fascinating tackle prospect with an incredible build and huge upside. However, he played college football in Canada at the University of British Columbia. Manu will face a huge difficulty spike going from Canadian college football to the NFL. He will slot in immediately as a rotational role player at best. It's entirely possible that he sits his entire rookie year and simply adjusts to the NFL game.\n\nThis is all well and good, but it came at the cost of a future third-round pick for the Lions. This is a sticking point even for those who can get on board with taking a shot on an international player in the middle rounds of the draft.\n\nManu doesn't have to turn out like Jordan Mailata for this to be a good pick, but expectations will be high.\n\nDrafting Sione Vaki to play running back is a choice\n\nVaki is another interesting prospect. He primarily played safety in college and took some snaps at running back. Detroit picked Vaki in the fourth round and when announcing the pick listed Vaki as a running back. The Lions have since confirmed that they plan to give Vaki coaching as a running back and see where his ceiling is at that position.\n\nThe potential is there for Vaki to be a three-phase player for Detroit -- contributing on offense, defense, and special teams. While that sounds nice, it is fair to question the quality of play he will provide in each phase. As a player who is converting positions, it seems hopeful to expect anything from the guy outside of special teams.\n\nBetween Manu and Vaki, it seems that Brad Holmes was feeling very confident on day three of the draft.\n\nIt will be fascinating to watch both Vaki and Manu in their rookie seasons.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors":

Maybe it's not perceived as any sort of need, even after the draft, with Marcus Davenport, CFL star Mathieu Betts and the return to health of James Houston deemed to be enough reinforcement.\n\nIt's also fair to say sacks (43; tied for 23rdin the league last year) can be random, and the Lions led the league in pressure rate last season (28.2 percent). Better converting that pressure into sacks happened down the stretch last year, so that's a positive looking to next season.\n\nStill, if you were to name post-draft needs/voids for the Lions, edge rusher would be on the list. A veteran addition would seem ideal. Davenport can't be counted on to stay healthy, and Houston still has a lot of hopeful projection in his outlook.\n\nThe Lions may just stand pat with what they have at edge rusher. But if they're looking, there are some good options out there.\n\nKristopher Knox of Bleacher Report has named one free agent who could help each Super Bowl contender in 2024. The Lions certainly fit the Super Bowl contender criteria, so they were given a free agent fit by Knox.\n\n\"The Lions should take a long look at Bud Dupree, who revitalized his career a bit with the Falcons after a couple of disappointing campaigns with the Tennessee Titans.\"\n\n\"Dupree finished the 2023 season with 6.5 sacks and 24 quarterback pressures to go with two forced fumbles and eight tackles for loss.

He also dropped an appropriate punch line.\n\n\"Look, the reality is this, everyone can't play here. Everyone can't play for the Detroit Lions, and that's just the reality, and that's just the standard that has been set.\"\n\nThe Lions, led by Holmes and head coach Dan Campbell, value culture fit right alongside (it not more than) a player's talent. Holmes has noted how sheer talent is not a great differentiator, it's the other things a player brings to the table that make the difference in who's a fit and who's not.\n\nOn the doorstep of going to the Super Bowl, leading the conference title game at halftime, it would've been easy for the Lions to change course. In a certain light, it might have been nice to see them take advantage of a perceived all-in position and make some big moves this offseason. Holmes has more recently made it clear he doesn't buy into the idea of being in a \"Super Bowl window.\"\n\nAri Meirov of The 33rd Team recently broke down the Lions' approach to their roster build, partly as a direct contrast to how the Buffalo Bills went all-in a few years ago after some playoff setbacks.\n\n\"Let's talk about the Detroit Lions' offseason, because it's been fun to see their roster-building approach throughout this process...Sometimes when you're a team and make it to the championship game, and you lose, especially in heart-breaking fashion, you go into the offseason and sometimes, it's like 'you know what, let's just go for it, we are so close...let's add a big name'\"\n\n\"There's probably no better example than the Buffalo Bills a few years ago...\"\n\nMeirov notes how the Bills have had to reset this offseason, cutting multiple key players and taking on dead money. The Lions of course did not do take that approach this offseason, knowing that the \"all-in\" piper will surely have to be paid at some point.\n\nMeirov also lauded how the Lions moved quickly to get long-term deals done with Amon-Ra St. Brown and Penei Sewell, with the cost only going to go up. The roster-building approach guided by Holmes has been methodical, as Meirov noted.\n\n\"It should be a college course on how to build an NFL team\", Meirov said. \"From the ground up, draft, develop, culture, sprinkle in free agents wherever you feel like you have needs, but don't go too hard.\"\n\nThe Lions' approach to roster building is not all-together revolutionary. But the \"draft, develop, keep your own\" idea can be a hard approach to stick to, and Meirov echoed the masses when he lauded their approach to this offseason.", "source": {"uri": "sidelionreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SideLion Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4923,h_2769,x_0,y_120/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/53/01hx55ndzajpkq5amkex.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540805", "eventUri": "eng-9540805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Lions fans were riding high because general manager Brad Holmes had just traded up to No. 24 to select Terrion Arnold, one of the top cornerbacks available.\n\nThe Packers countered by selecting offensive lineman Jordan Morgan, who was largely considered a second-day prospect. The ESPN broadcast showed a Packers fan wearing a cheesehead, and the Morgan selection clearly was not what he expected.\n\nA nearby Lions fan took full advantage of his friend's pain, laughing and pointing at him with both hands as the camera zoomed in and his friend's head dropped. It was the cherry on top of a perfect night in Downtown Detroit.\n\nWell, Lions safety Kerby Joseph enjoyed that moment so much, he sent that Lions fan a really cool gift: the cleats he was wearing when he picked off two passes from Aaron Rodgers. The Lions also eliminated the Packers from playoff contention that night.\n\n\"You made me laugh draft night, so here is my cleats I caught my first and second career (interceptions) from AROD,\" Joseph wrote, in part.\n\nThe Packers fan tweeted photos of his friend's gifts, saying, \"Even though I'm supposed to hate him as a Packers fan, I don't know how I can after this.\"\n\nThe Lions and Packers are widely expected to battle it out for the NFC North title this coming season, and the rivalry jabs are already off to a hot start.", "source": {"uri": "clickondetroit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WDIV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derick_hutchinson@clickondetroit.com", "name": "Derick Hutchinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesehead", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheesehead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerby_Joseph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerby Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/JHMD42XM2NGVDOBFOCL3PAQ5GA.png?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540805", "eventUri": "eng-9540805", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 225010714, "title": "Elton John Launches &#39;Speak Up Sing Out&#39; Campaign to End LGBTQ&#43; Discrimination (Exclusive)", "text": "Elton John is uplifting and empowering the LGBTQ+ community with his newest campaign. The music icon, 77, exclusively announced the launch of his \u201cSpeak Up Sing Out\u201d campaign to PEOPLE on Wednesday, May 29. The campaign aims to dismantle LGBTQ+ discrimination amid rising laws against the community in the U.S. and around the world, and it's kicking off its goals with a social media movement for Pride month. The campaign supports The Rocket Fund initiative, launched by the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 2023 to tackle the stigma, and asks for individuals to share their renditions of the final verse of the singer\u2019s iconic track \u201cYour Song\u201d while naming the person who supported them in their self-acceptance. \"Through The Rocket Fund, we've driven important policy changes around the world to uplift the LGBTQ+ community, because everyone deserves to be met with accessible, LGBTQ+ friendly HIV care and services,\u201d John tells PEOPLE of the campaign. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let increasing discriminatory legislation taking place around the world hold us back, let\u2019s lead with acceptance and joy this Pride Month and encourage everyone to be who they are and to love who they love without shame or fear,\u201d he continues. One lucky participant will also get to meet John, his husband and Rocket Fund co-chair, David Furnish, in New York City during Pride Month as a special thank you for joining the campaign. \u201cThink of the person who has fueled your journey to authenticity \u2014 a friend, a teacher, a loved one. Let's honor these special people in our lives and raise our voices together \u2014 I'll be listening for you to: Speak Up Sing Out!\" adds John. To be in with a chance of meeting the singer, participants must post a reel on Instagram of them singing a lyric from \u201cYour Song\u201d in replacement of the original lyrics, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, I hope you don\u2019t mind, that I put down in words how wonderful life is while you\u2019re in the world.\u201d They then must nominate the individual who has supported them by tagging the person in the caption with the hashtag: #SpeakUpSingOutGiveaway. Lastly, participants must follow the Elton John AIDS Foundation Instagram page @ejaf. \u201c \u2018Speak Up Sing Out\u2019 aims to shine a spotlight on the unsung heroes who inspire us to embrace our true selves,\u201d Furnish, 61, said. \u201cIt's about recognizing and honoring the courage and support of those who empower us to stand tall and be authentic in a world too often marked by discrimination and stigma \u2014 Elton and I can\u2019t wait to meet you and your guest during the most vibrant time of the year in New York, Pride Month!\u201d The new campaign supporting LGBQT+ people comes after 510 anti-LGBTQ+ laws against the community were introduced in the U.S. in 2023.", "summary": "&#34;Let\u2019s lead with acceptance and joy this Pride Month and encourage everyone to be who they are,&#34; the iconic singer says", "url": "https://people.com/elton-john-launches-campaign-supporting-lgbtq-community-exclusive-8655042", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/WCBjTLFYvahRMAvQC9LZx0o8TDs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(722x347:724x349)/elton-john-brit-awards-052924-1-960369533bb1408a87c93016b48562ea.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:27:00", "author": "Escher Walcott", "authors": ["Escher Walcott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 1.0}

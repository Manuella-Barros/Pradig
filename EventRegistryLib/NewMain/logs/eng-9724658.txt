The shortened races were introduced by F1 in 2021, with Silverstone, Monza, and Interlagos having the honour of hosting the first Sprint weekends.\n\nChina will kick off the 2025 Sprint calendar in late March, with Miami hosting the second Sprint of 2025 in the first week of May.\n\nSpa Francorchamps, located in the Belgian countryside, hosts the only European Sprint of the year in place of Austria, while Austin kicks off the second half of the Sprint calendar.\n\nInterlagos is still the only venue to have hosted a Sprint since 2021, with Qatar hosting the final Sprint weekend in December.\n\nHow does the Sprint weekend work?Unlike the traditional Grand Prix weekend schedule, which includes three practice sessions and a single qualifying and race, the Sprint format emphasizes competitive running from Friday to Sunday.\n\nA single 60-minute practice session on Friday morning kicks off proceedings before a shortened qualifying session in the afternoon sets the grid for the Sprint.\n\nThe drivers must use one compound in each qualifying segment: mediums for SQ1 and SQ2 and softs for SQ3. Like in a traditional session, five drivers are eliminated in the first two sections, with the top 10 fighting for pole position.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the Sprint takes place over a distance of 100km. The winner claims eight world championship points, with points going down to eighth.\n\nAfter the Sprint, a traditional qualifying session occurs, with the race taking place in it's traditional Sunday afternoon.\n\nDo the Sprints still have any use?Although they've been used by F1 since 2021 and decreased the number of sessions, which aren't as important to fans, sprint weekends haven't been universally adored.\n\nThe first controversy regarding sprints came when qualifying, typically held on a Saturday, was moved to Friday to accommodate the shortened race. This meant fans who would typically be working on Friday couldn't watch the session live.\n\nFor 2024, F1 refreshed the format by returning qualifying to its Saturday slot and moving the Sprint to the morning.\n\nOne of the sprint race's biggest critics is current world champion Max Verstappen, who has previously called for the format to be scrapped due to a lack of excitement.\n\nTelevision ratings tells another story, with live audience figures up 40% for the Chinese sprint weekend and an increase of 76% in viewership compared to FP2.\n\nIn F1's biggest growing market, the USA, 946,000 people watched the Miami Sprint on ESPN, making it the largest American audience ever seen for the Sprint.\n\nWho has won the most SprintsEven if he's not a fan of the format, Verstappen has won the most Sprints out of any driver with 10.\n\nValtteri Bottas is second on the list with two, while George Russell, Sergio Perez, and Oscar Piastri all have one apiece.\n\nLewis Hamilton, the only F1 driver to have won over 100 GPs, has never won a Sprint race despite finishing second twice.", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports / Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFormula 1 and the FIA have finalized the venues for the 2025 Sprint races, signaling continued enthusiasm for a format that has revitalized the viewing and attending experience since its 2021 debut.\n\nThe sport has seen a distinct improvement in racing quality, with varied winners such as Max Verstappen and George Russell. This surge in competitiveness is mirrored by a significant spike in spectator numbers, with events like the 2024 Chinese Grand Prix Sprint witnessing a 40% jump in live audience figures from top global markets.\n\nFor 2025, the FIA has confirmed Sprint races in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; Spa, Belgium; Shanghai, China; Miami, USA; Austin, USA; and Lusail, Qatar. S\u00e3o Paulo, a consistent favorite, will host a Sprint race for the fifth consecutive year, while Spa makes a notable return after a two-year hiatus.\n\nPerformance metrics from previous events illustrate the format's success. The Miami Sprint, for instance, brought in 946,000 viewers on ESPN, setting a new U.S. audience record for such events. Similarly, audience engagement during Sprint Qualifying rounds, such as those in Austria, surged by 76% compared to regular practice sessions.\n\nStefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, lauded the Sprint races for their dynamic addition to the sport, stating in a press release provided Sports Illustrated:\n\n\"The Sprint has been a great success for Formula 1, bringing all our fans more action and racing on the track. We are seeing the proof of this in our audience data, fan attendance on Fridays and from the promoters and partners. As we prepare to celebrate our 75th anniversary in 2025 we will always honour our incredible history, but we must always be looking ahead, innovating, and improving to deliver the best for our growing forward to those incredible events throughout the season.\"\n\nMohammed Ben Sulayem, President of the FIA, also reflected on the evolution of the Sprint.\n\n\"As the FIA Formula One World Championship celebrates its 75th anniversary in 2025, the Sprint will also enter its fifth year as part of the competition. Over that time, and through our strong collaboration with Formula 1 and with the input of all the teams, it has been through several different iterations and the regulations and format have evolved to give us the exciting and popular Sprints we have today. The six events for 2025 once again take in an interesting range of circuits and are sure to provide fans with plenty of additional action across the season.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9d\u00e9ration_Internationale_de_l'Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e3o_Paulo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Autodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Autodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Rosberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Gardens,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa,_Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spa, Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Spa, Belgium"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Domenicali", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefano Domenicali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusail", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lusail"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Ben_Sulayem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Ben Sulayem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Biathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Biathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4927,h_2771,x_0,y_519/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/f1briefings/01j2gvtx4g7jyvd639yt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724658", "eventUri": "eng-9724658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The additional dash-to-the-flag race on Saturday guarantees fans will experience three exciting days of on-track action at the Miami International Autodrome across the weekend of May 2-4, 2025.\n\nEarlier today, Formula 1 confirmed six venues will feature a Sprint in 2025 with Miami joining China, Belgium, Austin, Brazil and Qatar on the schedule to host the additional, shorter-format race. This will be Miami's second time hosting a sprint race. In May 2024, over 275,000 spectators attended the Miami International Autodrome as the event held a Sprint race for the first time. With two Qualifying sessions, the Sprint and Grand Prix itself on the Sunday, fans were treated to a competitive spectacle across all three days.\n\n\"We are thrilled to once again have the opportunity to host a Sprint race in 2025, which brings tremendous excitement and added energy to the race track and ultimately to the fans,\" said Tyler Epp, President of the FORMULA 1 CRYPTO.COM MIAMI GRAND PRIX. \"The Sprint guarantees all three days will have competitive sessions, and the drivers and teams have to be on the pace right away. It was a huge success for us in 2024, and we can't wait for the opportunity to deliver another world-class spectacle next May.\"\n\nFirst introduced in 2021, the Sprint is a 100km (62.14 mile) dash to the checkered flag, which is roughly one-third the distance of a standard Grand Prix. Five different winners have taken the top spot in the 15 Sprints to have been held in the past three years -- with seven different pole position holders. There are no mandatory pitstops and eight points are awarded for the winner, descending to one point for eighth place. Both drivers and teams score points for their respective championships.\n\nIn May, two winners were crowned across the weekend in Miami Gardens as Max Verstappen triumphed for Red Bull Racing in the 19-lap Sprint on Saturday, while McLaren's Lando Norris memorably took his first-ever Formula 1 victory at the 57-lap FORMULA 1 CRYPTO.COM MIAMI GRAND PRIX on Sunday.\n\nThe FORMULA 1 CRYPTO.COM MIAMI GRAND PRIX 2025 will be the fourth race to be held in Miami Gardens on a 3.36-mile track within the complex of Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins. Each year, Miami is the first of three F1 races to be held in the United States and has developed a reputation as an event that combines the fun and culture of Miami with a fan-focused experience, unrivaled food and beverage offerings and luxury hospitality. Fans interested in attending next year's race on May 2-4, 2025 are encouraged to sign up for more information on tickets at https://f1miamigp.com/.\n\nAbout the FORMULA 1 CRYPTO.COM MIAMI GRAND PRIX\n\nThe FORMULA 1 CRYPTO.COM MIAMI GRAND PRIX, established in 2022 on the FIA Formula 1 World Championship calendar, is the premier culmination of world-class racing, fan experience, entertainment and hospitality.

The event has generated more than $1 billion in economic impact to South Florida over its three years. SFM and Formula 1 have also worked closely to engage with and support the local Miami Gardens community, providing thousands of tickets annually for residents, creating a STEM education program through F1 in Schools, offering event internships for local students and featuring several community-owned restaurants on Campus during race weekend each year.\n\nThe history of Formula 1\u00ae began in 1950 and is the world's most prestigious motorsport competition and the world's most popular annual sporting series.

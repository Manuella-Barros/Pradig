Sun said US-led forces were \u201cpromoting military deployment and actions in the South China Sea, inciting and intensifying maritime disputes and contradictions, and damaging the legitimate rights and interests of coastal countries.\u201d A move by the United States to deploy medium-range missile systems in the area \u201cis dragging the region into the whirlpool of an arms race, placing the entire Asia Pacific region under the shadow of geopolitical conflicts,\u201d Sun said. China is committed to properly managing disputes with the parties in the South China Sea through dialogue, he added. In April, the Philippines said during a meeting with US allies that it was determined to assert its sovereign rights in the South China Sea, accusing China of escalating \u201cits harassment\u201d of the Philippines. China says almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion in annual ship commerce, and has deployed hundreds of coast guard vessels as far as 1,000 km off its mainland to police what it says is its jurisdiction. According to the Reuters report, the Philippines and China have sparred repeatedly this past year near disputed features that fall within Manila\u2019s exclusive economic zone. China routinely accuses the Philippines of encroachment while Manila and its allies have condemned what they call aggression by Beijing. The United States has said it stands with Manila.

Despite this, the price is not expected to increase significantly.\n\nThe main reason for this is the appreciation Leipzig's management has for Olmo's contributions. He has not only met their expectations on the field but also demonstrated his commitment to the club with notable gestures last year.\n\nGiven this, the German team feels it would be morally wrong to retain him against his wishes, and thus, they are willing to negotiate a reasonable transfer fee.\n\nMeanwhile, Barcelona see an opportunity here. Even though the path to acquiring Olmo is not straightforward, the club is hopeful.\n\nThey aim to negotiate the \u20ac60 million fee down while agreeing to additional performance-based payments after reaching an agreement with his agent.\n\nThis approach could benefit both parties -- if Olmo and Barcelona perform well, Leipzig stand to earn more than the initial release clause.\n\nOlmo is aware that the transfer process could start at any moment, especially once Barcelona secure the necessary financial structure to proceed.\n\nHis preference is clear: he wants to join Barcelona. However, he is also attracting interest from Premier League giants like Manchester United, who have made a tempting offer that would be hard to turn down under normal circumstances.\n\nAdding to the competition, Bayern Munich are also keen on signing Olmo as he has built a solid reputation in Germany, proving his star quality.\n\nIn summary, Barcelona are actively pursuing Olmo, hoping to negotiate a favourable deal with RB Leipzig.\n\nWhile the competition is stiff, Olmo's priority remains Barcelona.

However, he opted to join Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia at 16 and has been abroad ever since, moving to RB Leipzig in 2020.\n\nAnd with the Spaniard's release fee clause set to expire on Saturday, clubs interest in Olmo will have to act decisively this week if they want to sign the midfielder. Failure to trigger his release fee clause this summer would allow Leipzig to demand way more money than the $65m (\u00a352m/\u20ac60m) it would cost to exercise the existing clause.\n\nHis contract also runs until 2027 too, meaning the Bundesliga club has a stronger hand when it comes to negotiating a sale for Olmo.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leny_Yoro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leny Yoro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Merino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Merino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNK_Dinamo_Zagreb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GNK Dinamo Zagreb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCD_Espanyol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RCD Espanyol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Organizations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Clubs", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29547121.ece/alternates/s1200/0_gettyimages-2162037107.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

For those interested in the latest football odds from platforms such as bc game apk, we've looked at the five favourites to sign Dani Olmo this summer.\n\nLiverpool have been quiet in the transfer window to date as Arne Slot gets to grips with his new role at Anfield. Drafted in as the replacement for Jurgen Klopp, the Dutchman will want to run the rule over the squad he has inherited before big decisions are made.\n\nOlmo would offer a different dimension with regular goals from midfield, having netted an impressive haul of 11 in 39 caps for the Spanish national team.\n\nA Swiss Army Knife of a creative midfielder comfortable in various roles, Olmo could be an astute addition as Slot's reign takes shape. Liverpool lacked goals from central midfield last season with Alexis Mac Allister (5) the leading league scorer from the engine room. Olmo offers a potential connection between the middle of the park and the forward line.\n\nReal Madrid have made the statement of the summer transfer window after securing the signing of Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nThe arrival of PSG's record scorer and Brazilian teenager Endrick means Madrid are hardly short of firepower, though doubts over Rodrygo's future could tempt the Spaniards into a deal for Olmo.\n\nOlmo chose to leave La Masia in search of a route to first-team football, taking an unorthodox route to prominence after leaving Barcelona for Dinamo Zagreb as a 16-year-old. A decade on he is being linked with a return, where he could link up with Euro 2024-winning teammates Pedri, Lamine Yamal, Ferran Torres and Fermin Lopez at the Camp Nou.\n\nHowever, finances are restricted at Barcelona, who are focused on signing Nico Williams from Athletic Bilbao. Olmo, however, is understood to be a viable alternative.\n\nBayern Munich's strategy around signings has often been to cherry-pick the best talents from their divisional rivals. The gap in wealth between the Bundesliga behemoth and their counterparts has made that possible, with Hiroki Ito (Stuttgart) and Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen) signed or pursued from the two teams who finished above them last season.\n\nOlmo is another player who could be targeted in a raid on RB Leipzig. Bayern know better than most what the Spaniard is capable of after he scored a hat-trick against them in last season's German Super Cup.\n\nManchester City are the favourites to sign Olmo with Pep Guardiola a known admirer of his counterpart. The Citizens have doubts over the futures of Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva heading into the new campaign and Olmo would offer an attractive replacement.\n\nA talented technician comfortable in tight areas of the pitch, he looks stylistically suited to Guardiola-ball.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The player's agents, with whom Barcelona's sporting director Deco met earlier this week, have received an official proposal from the club.\n\nJournalist Ferran Martinez details that this proposal includes a six-year contract for Olmo, while his current club, RB Leipzig, would be compensated around \u20ac60 million, as per the buyout clause in his contract.\n\nThis amount comprises both fixed payments and some variable bonuses.\n\nDespite the fact that the deadline for the \u20ac60 million clause expires this Saturday, Olmo and his representatives have managed to negotiate an extension, allowing this clause to remain effective for a few more weeks.\n\nStarting tomorrow, Olmo, along with his agents and family, will closely examine Barcelona's proposal. They will also communicate this offer to RB Leipzig, who will have the final decision on the transfer.\n\nDuring a recent appearance, Olmo expressed that he wants to feel truly wanted by any club interested in signing him, and a strong proposal is essential for that. Barcelona have responded promptly to this sentiment by sending their offer.\n\nSimilar to their strategy with other high-profile signings like Robert Lewandowski and Ilkay Gundogan, Barcelona are structuring Olmo's contract to include lower wages for the initial two years to comply with La Liga's financial fair play rules, with a significant salary increase starting from the third year.\n\nWhile awaiting Leipzig's response, Olmo is reportedly viewing Barcelona's offer positively. However, he will take his time to carefully consider it, as he also has interest from other top European clubs.\n\nManchester City and Bayern Munich have been particularly aggressive in their pursuit of the Spanish international in recent days.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundo_Deportivo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mundo Deportivo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c9aDDUPSqcjzMgeaxhGxbQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/barca_universal_articles_732/e8799f6da6fc5d8e94d5c779288d5083", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

A \u00a350.5m (\u20ac60m) release clause in his contract expires on July 20, but Leipzig are said to be mindful of a sale even after that date has passed.\n\nAS report that United now are especially pushing for Olmo's arrival as their rebuild under the ownership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe continues. The Red Devils have already brought in Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro this window, with their total outlay already nearing the \u00a3100m mark.\n\nUnited are said to be keen to bring in some more stars in their prime to complement their young talent as well as play alongside veteran stars such as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro.\n\nOn the other side of Manchester, City too are pursuing Olmo having recently finalised their first incoming of the summer - Brazil international Savinho from fellow CFG side Troyes.\n\nBayern Munich have been busy making major moves in the market with the additions of Michael Olise, Hiroki Ito and Joao Palhinha, but want another creative player to bolster Vincent Kompany's ranks. Olmo and Xavi Simons are the two options under consideration at the Allianz Arena.\n\n90min revealed earlier this month that Barcelona had verbally agreed to pay Leipzig the sum of Olmo's release clause, but in a more favourable payment structure, but this was yet to be accepted by the Bundesliga side.

The Old Trafford club has already completed deals for Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee with Manuel Ugarte another played believed to be on United's radar. Most recently, Dani Olmo has been mentioned as a potential target after an eye-catching Euro 2024 for eventual winners Spain.\n\nOlmo wasn't meant to be a first team figure for Spain, but the injury suffered by Pedri opened the door for the RB Leipzig midfielder to nail down a starting spot. Olmo made the most of that opportunity by scoring three goals as Spain went on to lift the European Championship trophy this summer.\n\nOf course, Olmo was already known for being a top level attacking midfielder in the Bundesliga, but his performances for Spain at Euro 2024 highlighted his readiness for the next step in his club career. According to recent reports in Spain this week, Manchester United could offer this to the 26-year-old.\n\nAs long as United lacks a world class centre forward, Olmo would bring some valuable goal threat with his late runs into the opposition area. This was key for Spain at Euro 2024 and it's not difficult to envisage Olmo making runs beyond the likes of Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee to get himself into dangerous positions in the final third.\n\nA Manchester United move for Olmo could hinge on the future of Bruno Fernandes. While the Portuguese midfielder has been a rare consistent performer for United over the last few seasons, interest from the Saudi Pro League could make this the perfect time to cash in. After all, Fernandes will turn 30 in September.\n\nReports claim there is a \u20ac60m release clause in Olmo's contract at RB Leipzig. This represents something of a bargain in the current transfer market with the 26-year-old entering his peak years as a professional. He is also proven at the top level and would fit in well at a big club like Manchester United.\n\nIt's feasible that United could reinvest money from the sale of Fernandes in Olmo and the addition of another central midfielder such as Ugarte who, according to reports, would likely cost around \u20ac40m. Would Erik ten Hag be better equipped with two news midfielders in his squad over the ageing Fernandes?\n\nUnited is at an interesting point in its recent history following the arrival of INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe as new minority owners. There is renewed ambition at Old Trafford and this is reflected in the business that has been done so far this summer. There is more work to be done, though, and Olmo would be a shrewd addition.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelson_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelson Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Professional_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Professional League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/669ba060856716161239a848/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Their economic reality simply does not allow such a gift, and the club has had to work around it in recent summers. However, as more time has passed, the restrictions on Barcelona have decreased as well.\n\nThis relative leniency has not just magically appeared, however, and has instead required a lot of work. The Barcelona board has worked non-stop to achieve this sense of sustainability again and it has undoubtedly cost the club, especially last season.\n\nHowever, with some economic strength recovered, Barcelona are hoping to sign the likes of Nico Williams and Dani Olmo. The Athletic Club star's operation is reportedly already in an advantage stage, but Olmo's operation could end up being accelerated as well thanks to RB Leipzig.\n\nAccording to SPORT, the Bundesliga side will respect Olmo's decision to leave Germany and join Barcelona because the club feels indebted to him. Due to this feeling, RB Leipzig will remain lenient and even accept a valuation close to the \u20ac60 million release clause for Olmo that has already expired.\n\nThis gratitude from Leipzig comes due to Olmo's actions last summer. Despite being approached by Manchester City, arguably the most successful club in Europe in recent seasons, the Spanish star decided to stay at Leipzig and help them in a time of need.\n\nTo repay this gesture, the German club will be willing to negotiate with Barcelona without extravagant demands. Instead, they would be happy to accept a figure close to the \u20ac60 million mark as they will look to facilitate Olmo's departure without causing too many problems.\n\nOlmo himself, moreover, is more determined than ever before to return to Barcelona. Belonging to La Masia, this is as good a chance as any for the 26-year-old Spaniard to return to his home and serve in a leading role within the team. That has already been promised to him, and he hopes to play a crucial role for Bar\u00e7a.\n\nHowever, the Catalan club will look to negotiate with Leipzig and get them to agree to a lower value than \u20ac60 million. The club might also propose a formula that sees a significant part of the payment arrive in variables, something that would suit both parties.\n\nFor Barcelona, paying in variables would decrease the upfront amount that they have to pay. While for RB Leipzig, these variables could end up earning them more than even \u20ac60 million if Olmo succeeds on a sporting level with La Blaugrana.\n\nTime is still ticking, however, and Bar\u00e7a will need to act fast. Clubs like Manchester United seem to be serious in their pursuit of Dani Olmo, and if Barcelona are unable to finalize the signing soon it could lead to the Premier League side making a massive leap in negotiations.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Masia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Self-Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Self-Improvement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/N1CJlNKkOoCuxniVci7Izw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/barca_news_network_articles_785/1d473d12f3400b749c579414ba41f7ac", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The longer that the Catalan club waits, the more difficult it becomes to attain certain targets. That is why, even at this crucial stage, Barcelona does have some clear targets for themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, this often spells bad news for the players who are seen as alternative options. They are often left in a limbo of sorts with no particular idea about where exactly their futures lie. However, for a certain Barcelona target, that could not be further from the truth.\n\nDani Olmo, aged 26, is one of the players that Barcelona seems to value a lot. Over the last few seasons, the Catalan club has been unable to sign him due to the expensive nature of his transfer, and due to their own financial restrictions and limitations.\n\nNow, with Nico Williams as their new priority, Dani Olmo is once again left in the background. However, for the player himself, the one thing that he will value a lot when he chooses his next destination is something that he made clear recently, as highlighted by SPORT:\n\nThe player has had a spectacular campaign in the latest edition of the European Championship, and his accomplishments have not gone unnoticed. Beyond just winning the prestigious title with Spain, the RB Leipzig star was also the joint top scorer of the competition.\n\nDue to those accomplishments and the fact that he has a \u20ac60 million release clause in place until the 20th of July, the Spanish star has a lot of suitors.

A meeting between Sporting Director Deco and Nico Williams' agent was revealed on Wednesday evening, and now it has come to light that he has also met with Dani Olmo's agent this week.\n\nAs per MD, Deco met with Olmo's agent to get closer on personal terms with a view to signing the RB Leipzig creator. They say that Olmo's signing is not necessarily dependent on how things go with Williams. Olmo has a release clause of \u20ac60m that expires on the 20th of July, and is attracting interest from Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\n\nThe report continues on to detail that Atletico are trailing in terms of Olmo's preferences. The 26-year-old, who is under contract at Leipzig until 2027, is keen on returning to Barcelona, and it is also noted that he shares an agent with Mikayil Faye, whose future at Barcelona is in doubt.\n\nOlmo commented on Wednesday that his agent 'already knows' what he wants to do, and left his future up in the air. So far Olmo has always been posited as an alternative to Williams, and certainly it seems unlikely Barcelona would be unlikely to sign both. Not least because of the fit. If Williams arrives, Olmo would either compete for a spot on the left or play in a number 10 role, which Pedri, Fermin Lopez, Ilkay Gundogan and potentially Gavi would all compete for.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavi_(footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavi (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/football_espana_articles_993/ad3b091c2c504ab0f6f70736424c747f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 574, "textEnd": 586}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The English giants face stiff competition from Barcelona and Bayern Munich, but they should not be a problem if City decide they want the player.\n\nBarca are looking to sign Olmo's Spain teammate Nico Williams ahead of the new season and the Catalan club will not be able to afford both given their financial issues.\n\nAs for Bayern, the German giants have already splashed out \u20ac60m on Michael Olise and \u20ac56m on Joao Palhinha this summer, which doesn't leave much room for another big signing.\n\nMan City are in a very good place if they decide to move for Olmo but whether they submit an official proposal, remains to be seen.\n\nOlmo is a top midfield talent and his ability to play in multiple roles makes him very attractive for managers.\n\nThe 26-year-old was one of Euro 2024's standout performers in Germany as he helped Spain win the tournament, finishing as the joint-winner of the Golden Boot with three goals. The Spaniard's stock is at an all-time high and there is no better time for him to make a move.\n\nThe Leipzig star has suffered with several injury issues throughout his career and this is a big reason why he hasn't moved to a big club sooner.\n\nMan City would be a very exciting next step for the Euro 2024 winner as Pep Guardiola would certainly take his game to the next level in Manchester.", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darren_looney@caughtoffside.com", "name": "Darren Looney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u00e3o_Palhinha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u00e3o Palhinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://icdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rabiot-olmo-euros.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 294, "textEnd": 301}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The attacking midfielder, who secured a regular starting spot after Pedri's injury, ended the tournament as one of the top scorers.\n\nThe RB Leipzig star has been a long-term target for Barcelona, and his performances in the recently concluded Euros only accentuated the interest. After all, he is a graduate of La Masia and knows the team's style inside out.\n\nOlmo is currently in Spain, celebrating the team's historic win and visiting his hometown during his holidays. His future, however, is still unclear with several clubs, including Bayern Munich, interested in a transfer this summer.\n\nAs revealed by SPORT, Olmo was in Vallesa earlier today and was approached by fans for autographs after the event. He signed the shirts, which were Barcelona kits, and many felt it could be a premonitory sign of a possible transfer.\n\nWith his release clause set at \u20ac60 million and set to expire in just three days, however, a move to Catalonia appears unlikely at this stage. After all, Joan Laporta and Co. have their eyes set on Nico Williams.\n\nSpeaking to the media earlier today, the Spanish phenom was asked to comment on his future and the club he would like to join. In fact, he was even specifically asked about a possible move to Barcelona, to which he said:\n\n\"There are several options, and the people who handle my affairs know what I want, as I said.\"\n\n\"I want to be in a place where I am valued, and the fundamental thing for me is to win; I am very ambitious,\" he added.\n\nIt thus remains to be seen if Barcelona make an aggressive push for the Leipzig star in the coming days.

This high-stakes transfer saga has caught the attention of football fans worldwide, with Olmo's \u20ac60m release clause set to expire on July 20. Diario AS reports that United are particularly eager to bring Olmo to Old Trafford, continuing their ambitious rebuild under the new ownership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\nDani Olmo has broke out as a standout player in the football world, thanks to his stellar performances in Euro 2024. The 26-year-old played a pivotal role in Spain's triumph, contributing three goals and two assists. His remarkable skills and consistent form have made him one of the most sought-after players in the transfer market this summer.\n\nManchester United's interest in Olmo signals their intent to strengthen their squad significantly. Having already secured the signings of Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro, their total expenditure this window is approaching the \u00a3100m mark. Under Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership, there is a clear urgency to inject prime talent into the team. Olmo, with his creative prowess, is seen as a perfect fit to complement young stars and veterans like Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro.\n\nThe competition for Olmo's signature is fierce. Manchester City, fresh from signing Brazil international Savinho, are keen on adding more creative flair to their ranks. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich, who have already signed Michael Olise, Hiroki Ito, and Joao Palhinha, view Olmo as a key target to bolster Vincent Kompany's squad. Additionally, Barcelona, having reportedly agreed verbally to pay Olmo's release clause, remain in talks with Leipzig, vying to finalise a deal.\n\nOlmo's \u20ac60m release clause is a crucial factor in this transfer saga. While it expires on July 20, RB Leipzig appears open to negotiations even after this date. This has kept multiple top clubs in the fray, each hoping to secure Olmo's services for the upcoming season.\n\nFrom a Manchester United supporter's perspective, this pursuit of Dani Olmo is a statement of intent. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership has brought a renewed sense of urgency and ambition to the club's transfer activities. Olmo's addition could be transformative, potentially bridging the gap between United and their rivals.\n\nOne of United's glaring weaknesses in recent seasons has been the lack of a dynamic playmaker. While Bruno Fernandes has shouldered much of the creative burden, Olmo could provide an additional dimension to United's attack. His vision, dribbling skills, and ability to link play would significantly enhance United's offensive capabilities.\n\nOlmo's versatility allows him to play across various attacking positions, making him a valuable asset for any team. For United, his presence could mean more fluidity and unpredictability in their attacking play. Combining Olmo's creativity with the youthful energy of players like Mainoo and the experience of Casemiro could create a formidable lineup capable of challenging for top honours.\n\nSecuring a player of Olmo's calibre would also send a strong message to United's competitors. It would signal that United are not just participants in the transfer market but serious contenders aiming to return to their former glory.

Diego Simeone's side haven't been linked with the Spaniard despite several others having reportedly been in the mix for months.\n\nLiverpool are one of those. They've had their name placed in the Olmo rumour mill for a while, and it's a link that's become increasingly prominent.\n\nMajor Alisson Becker update as Fabrizio Romano reveals Al-Nassr deal for Brazil international goalkeeper7 hours agoby Peter Staunton\n\nOlmo had a fantastic Euro 2024, earning a lot of attention for the transfer window. That's particularly relevant because he has a release clause in his contract - anyone can get him for \u00a350m right now.\n\nThat clause, however, expires on Monday. Any club hoping to get him for that price must do so quickly and it sounds as though Atletico might try.\n\nThey're supposedly also trying to sign Julian Alvarez from Manchester City, though. It's difficult to see how they'd afford the money for both but if anyone else does want Olmo, they can't take a chance on that.\n\nRB Leipzig will raise the price once the clause expires and as Bild say, it could rise very high if multiple clubs get involved.\n\nAs we've mentioned before, Olmo isn't exactly the most reliable player in the world. He missed 27 games for RB Leipzig last season and another 20 before that.\n\nIt's not the kind of injury record that Liverpool can afford to take a chance on. Injuries hurt them badly last season and finding a fix for that should be priority one this summer.\n\nAnd so we imagine they'll ignore the Olmo clause entirely and allow him to head elsewhere this summer.

starred for Spain at Euro 2024.\n\nyou have updates\n\nBarcelona have reportedly placed a six-year contract on the table for Dani Olmo, with the Catalan giants determined to secure his signature from RB Leipzig this summer.\n\nThe 26-year-old played an important role in Spain winning Euro 2024, scoring three goals and registering two assists in six appearances at the competition.\n\nOlmo did not start the tournament in Spain's first XI, but he benefitted from an injury to Pedri in the quarter-finals of the competition to play a key role in the latter stages.\n\nThere has been widespread speculation surrounding the forward's future this summer, with a number of clubs believed to be keen to secure his signature, including Premier League giants Chelsea.\n\nHowever, Barcelona are thought to lead the race for the attacker, who represented the Catalan outfit's youth academy between 2007 and 2014 before leaving for Dinamo Zagreb.\n\nBarcelona 'place' six-year contact offer on table\n\nAccording to Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona have offered Olmo a six-year deal to return to Camp Nou, and the Catalan outfit are now confident of winning the race for his signature.\n\nThe report claims that Leipzig have also agreed to keep the \u20ac60m (\u00a350.6m) release clause in his current deal 'for a few more weeks'.\n\nThe buy-out fee is thought to have officially expired last week, but Barcelona are allegedly expecting to close a deal for \u20ac60m (\u00a350.6m) following positive discussions with his German club.\n\nThe Catalan outfit would allegedly pay the amount over a longer period in order to ensure that they comply with financial rules.\n\nOlmo is reportedly yet to make a final call on his future, as Liverpool, Atletico Madrid and Manchester United could yet place rival bids on the table.\n\nDo Barcelona still want Williams?\n\nBarcelona are also working on a deal for Athletic Bilbao attacker Nico Williams, who starred alongside Olmo for Spain at this summer's European Championship.\n\nThe 22-year-old scored twice and registered one assist in six appearances for his country at the competition, including a goal in the final against England.\n\nThere is also said to be Premier League interest in the forward, but he has allegedly given priority to Barcelona.\n\nWilliams entered the European Championship off the back of scoring eight goals and registering 19 assists in 37 appearances for Athletic during the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nThe attacker has a \u20ac58m (\u00a349m) buy-out clause in his contract at San Mames.\n\nbody check tags ::",

The situation is still quiet but I have a feeling things can happen in the next days or even weeks if Leipzig will accept any kind of proposal close to 60-65m after the expiry of the release clause. For example, for Bayern he's one of the players on the list since May. Really appreciated, but the top priority is Xavi Simons.

RB Leipzig are open to bids, but his injury record raises one big red flag. The potential return on investment for Man Utd could be jeopardised by his recent injury history.\n\nDani Olmo had a magnificent Euro 2024, scoring three goals, and being named in the team of the tournament, which has caused a host of clubs, including Manchester United, to consider bidding for the attacking midfielder (who has a release clause of roughly \u00a350m), but despite his undeniable ability, his injury record over recent years suggests buying him does represent a risk.\n\nSuch is the embarrassment of riches at Spain's disposal, Olmo didn't even get off the bench for his country's group-stage win over Italy. Had Pedri not been forced off injured inside the first 10 minutes of the quarter-final with Germany, Olmo may not have played in that game either, but Spain are thankful he did, with a wonderful feint of body enabling the Leipzig player to score the opening goal.\n\nThen, in the semi-finals, he repeated the feat with another individual piece of brilliance to score against France and help secure Spain's place in the final. Equally influential in the victory in the final against England, it is understandable that a clamour of clubs are considering a bid for Olmo, but he has missed 49 games over the last two seasons, suggesting he would not provide a return on investment for Erik ten Hag.\n\nRelated Exclusive: \u00a352m Spain Star 'Open to Man Utd Move'\n\nManchester United have been handed a significant boost in their hopes of winning the race for Dani Olmo\n\n3 Unquestionable Talent Harry Kane has suffered twice in finals at the hands of Olmo\n\nIf Manchester United bought the Spaniard, then it would make sense to build a side around him. His ability is not in question, Olmo denied Harry Kane another trophy when he scored a hat trick for Leipzig in a 3-0 win over Bayern Munich in the DFL Supercup final last season, but he has not played more than 23 Bundesliga games in the last three seasons.\n\nAn even more telling statistic is that he has missed 49 games over the course of the last two seasons because of injuries that appear to be both varied and yet consistent. Would that track record be able to cope with the sheer amount of games played in England? Not to mention the physicality of the Premier League.\n\nGreat form interrupted in 2022/23 Injuries have limited Olmo's game time\n\nThis recent injury pattern appears to have begun in September 2022, when he had to come off for RB Leipzig in a league game with Eintracht Frankfurt after only 10 minutes because of a knee injury. This turned out to be a partial rupture of his left anterior knee ligament. Although he was back within six weeks, it still meant the Spanish international missed the vast majority of Leipzig's Champions League campaign.\n\nOlmo told the club his rehab programme was going well, but a pattern had begun. While he played in eight games between the end of October and January 2023, he completed 90 minutes on just one occasion during that time. Then, in the next match, he had to come off at half-time after tearing a muscle in his thigh. A further five Leipzig matches were missed. He would complete 90 minutes in the league only twice from March until the end of May.\n\nDani Olmo injuries since 2021/22\n\nSeason\n\nInjury\n\nFrom\n\nUntil\n\nDays out injured\n\nInternational and club games missed\n\n21/22\n\nTorn muscle fibre\n\nSep 16 2021\n\nOct 25 2021\n\n39\n\n9\n\n21/22\n\nTorn muscle fibre\n\nNov 18 2021\n\nDec 27 2021\n\n39\n\n8\n\n21/22\n\nCoronavirus\n\nJan 3 2022\n\nJan 13 2022\n\n10\n\n1\n\n21/22\n\nCold\n\nMar 10 2022\n\nMar 17 2022\n\n7\n\n1\n\n22/23\n\nKnee ligament tear\n\nSep 1 2022\n\nOct 20 2022\n\n49\n\n13\n\n22/23\n\nTorn muscle fibre\n\nJan 28 2023\n\nMar 4 2023\n\n35\n\n7\n\n23/24\n\nKnee injury (sprain)\n\nSep 9 2023\n\nOct 16 2023\n\n37\n\n11\n\n23/24\n\nShoulder injury\n\nOct 29 2023\n\nDec 21 2023\n\n53\n\n16\n\n23/24\n\nMuscular injury\n\nMay 11 2024\n\nJune 1 2024\n\n21\n\n2\n\nTotal\n\n290\n\n68\n\nCan Olmo Deal With the Physicality of a Long Season? Further injury problems during 2023/24\n\nThere were serious concerns again in September 2023, when he had to be substituted in Spain's Euro 2024 qualification game with Georgia after spraining his knee. It meant another four Leipzig games out due to injury. Worse was to come in late October. After a 10-minute cameo to ease him back into action and three days after a Champions League goal against Red Belgrade, he lasted only seven minutes after coming on as a sub against FC Koln. It wasn't the knee this time, it was his shoulder, falling sideways after being fouled and loosening his collarbone and tearing three ligaments in his shoulder. He required surgery, but was back in the new year of 2024. He completed 90 minutes in only of six of the following 16 Leipzig Bundesliga games, missing the final two league games due to muscular problems.\n\nOlmo is somebody you would want to build your team around, if he were fully fit over a prolonged period of time, but if he cannot play enough matches it leaves a team with a problem. There are rumours Manchester City are also interested, so United will need to make a decision fast. Olmo is a wonderful player, who has already achieved so much in the game, but his signing could prove a risk to them if his injury track record is anything to go by.\n\nStats via Transfermarkt (as of 17/07/24).", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFL-Supercup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DFL-Supercup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eintracht_Frankfurt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eintracht Frankfurt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1._FC_K\u00f6ln", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1.

And the most obvious name to be sold in that scenario would be Ansu Fati.\n\nBack after a disappointing season on loan at Brighton, Ansu has been motivated to prove himself to new manager Hansi Flick and has been working hard to improve himself physically and make an impression in pre-season.\n\nBut if both Nico and Olmo were to arrive, Fati would be starved of minutes at Bar\u00e7a and offloading him would make the most sense for the club as well as the player.\n\nAnother forward who could become surplus to requirements to if Barcelona sign both Nico and Olmo would be Raphinha. The Brazilian is already behind Lamine Yamal in the pecking order on the right flank and had to play on the left side at times last season.\n\nShould Nico arrive, the left-wing would become his spot and with Olmo being able to play anywhere in attack, Raphinha would fall another rung or two down on the order of preference.\n\nThe 27-year-old has suitors in the Premier League and Saudi Arabia who are ready to splash the cash on his signing, making his exit a logical option. But with the player reluctant to leave, Deco & co. would have their task cut out to convince him.\n\nThe veteran midfielder has been at Barcelona for only one season and enjoyed a solid debut season, making value contributions in attack while adding his experience and leadership to the table.\n\nHowever, with Barcelona set to make changes to the way they operate under Hansi Flick, Gundogan might not be best suited to the demands of playing in the double pivot in midfield while he would be behind Pedri and possibly Olmo in the No. 10 role.\n\nFurthermore, his high wages would also become an issue for Bar\u00e7a and as such an exit could be considered, especially if Barcelona succeed in signing Olmo.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Gonz\u00e1lez_(footballer,_born_2002)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Gonz\u00e1lez (footballer, born 2002)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansu_Fati", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ansu Fati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Laporta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joan Laporta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphinha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansi_Flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hansi Flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Pp_CNCqVT.cBlM6lPM0MqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/barca_universal_articles_732/453817e1777cdd116921d80fed758a0f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Nevertheless, the Euro 2024 winner has now made it clear that he is looking to leave Leipzig this summer, whether it be moving to Bayern or elsewhere.\n\nSpeaking to the Spanish newspaper Marca, Olmo commented on the interest from Barcelona: \"My advisors, who are dealing with this, already know what I want to do. I don't know if I will stay in Germany; we will see. I want to be in a place where I am appreciated and loved, and what I want to do is win. There are several options; we will see what happens.\"\n\nOlmo had previously played in the Barcelona academy from 2007-2014 before departing Catalonia for Dinamo Zagreb. With the Spanish side trying whatever they can to sign Olmo and Nico Williams this summer, Bayern will certainly have competition for the 26-year-old's signature.\n\nRegardless, PSG's late bid to sign Dou\u00e9 could leave the record champions being forced to act quickly in order to get a deal for Olmo over the line. With his \u20ac60 million release valid until July 20, Bayern may look to trigger that deal in the coming days, should Dou\u00e9 decide on a move to the French capital.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marca_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marca (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNK_Dinamo_Zagreb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GNK Dinamo Zagreb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jX.H6k6lJUrUpfHEZei19g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/get_german_football_news_articles_128/30a235b2f35f709ecb5f19ada2ba60be", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1313, "textEnd": 1320}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Are we really ready for the arrival of Dani Olmo and the departure of someone important? It would worry me.\"\n\nRomero has enough of a track record reporting on Bar\u00e7a to make this new report at least believable, but the lack of a name opens the door for even more speculation. The usual names of Ronald Araujo, Jules Kounde and Frenkie de Jong will pop up, but Romero seems to indicate someone who seems \"untouchable\" could be on the market if the right offer arrives to allow Olmo to be signed.\n\nEngland reach semifinals after perfect penalty shootout series against Switzerland Galatasaray announces Michy Batshuayi transfer", "source": {"uri": "en.apa.az", "dataType": "news", "title": "Azeri - Press Informasiya Agentliyi"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Masia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ara\u00fajo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Ara\u00fajo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michy_Batshuayi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michy Batshuayi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatasaray_S.K._(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galatasaray S.K.

United are looking to bolster their forward options, and provide Erik ten Hag with more depth in these areas. Matthijs De Ligt and Jonathan Tah continue to be linked to United, with another central defender seemingly a priority.\n\nManchester United are interested in signing RB Leipzig's Dani Olmo, who has a \u20ac60 million release clause valid until 20th July, according to AS.\n\nOlmo, who flourished in Spain's Euro 2024 winning exploits, had an impressive 2023/24 campaign with Leipzig, netting four goals and registering five assists in 17 Bundesliga starts. The attacking midfielder has thus attracted widespread attention from top clubs, with United said to be in the race to land his signature.\n\nLeipzig are willing to sell the 26-year-old in this window, but will reportedly be tough negotiators. However, interested parties can surpass these club-to-club negotiations if they trigger Olmo's release clause, which expires today. The player is said to be keen on a move to an ambitious sporting project, which he'll supposedly prioritise over other factors.\n\nUnited Want to Sign Olmo The Red Devils look to continue their active window\n\nEmerging through the prestigious La Masia academy, Olmo completed a shock switch to Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb at the age of 16. This is where he made his breakthrough in senior football, making 125 appearances across six seasons for the Prva NHL outfit.\n\nImpressing in Eastern Europe, the Spaniard earned a move to Germany in January 2020. Since then, he's established himself as one of the Bundesliga's most dependable and versatile attacking midfielders, who also operates out wide.\n\nNow, a move to one of Europe's top clubs may be on the cards. United are looking to strengthen in forward areas, and have identified Olmo - described as \"elite\" by OptaFranz - as a potential option who can provide cover and competition for any of the three positions in behind the striker. As GIVEMESPORT sources revealed, it's a move Olmo would be open to as well.\n\nSpanish outlet AS (via Sport Witness) report that the Red Devils have 'entered the scene with force' to try and sign the Terrassa-born man. INEOS want to provide Erik ten Hag with greater depth in these areas, and see the player playing minutes on the right, as well as pushing the likes of Bruno Fernandes centrally and Alejandro Garnacho on the left.\n\nWhile United are unlikely to activate Olmo's \u20ac60 million release clause today, they may initiate negotiations early next week. The north-west club have already wrapped up the signings of Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro for \u00a336.5 million and \u00a352 million respectively, so may have to sell before they make further moves in the transfer market.\n\nHowever, Sport Witness suggest that Leipzig may be trying to use United's so-called intense interest in their player to put pressure on other suitors to act quickly.\n\nOlmo's Premier League Statistics 2023/24\n\nAppearances\n\n21\n\nGoals\n\n4\n\nAssists\n\n5\n\nShots Per 90\n\n2.8\n\nExpected Goals Per 90\n\n0.2\n\nKey Passes Per 90\n\n1.99\n\nExpected Assists Per 90\n\n0.23\n\nSuccessful Take-Ons Per 90\n\n1.93\n\nTackles and Interceptions Per 90\n\n2.42\n\nUnited Still Want Another Defender De Ligt and Tah continue to be linked\n\nWhile acquiring additional offensive firepower is likely on sporting director Dan Ashworth's list of things to do in the window, it appears the club are favouring re-building their squad from the back at this present moment. Despite landing Yoro in a marquee deal, links to the likes of Matthijs de Ligt and Jonathan Tah persist.\n\nDe Ligt is said to be keen on joining United, with talks reportedly ongoing between the FA Cup Winners and Bayern Munich over a deal. However, the German side's hefty asking price of \u00a343 million is perhaps deterring United from pursuing the Dutchman, and they may look to pivot to Tah, who is deemed 'more affordable'.\n\nRelated

But another name that's been heavily linked with the Blaugrana is Nico's Spain teammate and former La Masia star Dani Olmo, who is expected to leave RB Leipzig this summer and appears to favor a return to his childhood club.\n\nAnd according to a new report by Gerard Romero, Bar\u00e7a's interest is strong enough that the club is willing to part ways with a key member of the current squad to fund a move for Olmo.\n\nHere's what Romero's said: \"I'm not going to say a name, but today there were two representatives who gave me the name of a Bar\u00e7a player who could be put on the market in the event of Dani Olmo's arrival, and I didn't expect this name. Are we really ready for the arrival of Dani Olmo and the departure of someone important? It would worry me.\"\n\nRomero has enough of a track record reporting on Bar\u00e7a to make this new report at least believable, but the lack of a name opens the door for even more speculation. The usual names of Ronald Araujo, Jules Kounde and Frenkie de Jong will pop up, but Romero seems to indicate someone who seems \"untouchable\" could be on the market if the right offer arrives to allow Olmo to be signed.\n\nCould that be Pedri, or Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, or Robert Lewandowski? All three appear key pieces of Hansi Flick's plans, but the new Bar\u00e7a coach certainly knows Olmo from this time in the Bundesliga and might be in favor of a move due to Dani's age.\n\nOnly time will tell if there's any truth to this rumor, but it's certainly one to watch. Olmo fits the profile of a classic number 10 who can also play on the wing, which would be an excellent fit if Flick moves to a German-style 4-2-3-1 formation. His past with Bar\u00e7a and his great talent shown in Euro 2024 make him an obvious target, but Bar\u00e7a need money to make his signing a realitiy.\n\nAnd that money might have to come from a player they don't really want to sell.", "source": {"uri": "barcablaugranes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Barca Blaugranes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "renato_goncalves@barcablaugranes.com", "name": "Renato Gon\u00e7alves", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Romero_(footballer,_born_1998)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Romero (footballer, born 1998)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Masia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Spanish_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Spanish Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ara\u00fajo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Ara\u00fajo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZpiX7u6mCk2cJYv8cwGtP1kyGQk=/0x0:6180x3090/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25537677/2162498342.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-02", "dateEnd": "-03-01", "textStart": 1755, "textEnd": 1762}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

As Gianluca Di Marzio highlighted in his recent interview with wettbasis.com, Bayern Munich's interest in Dani Olmo could hinge on their ability to act swiftly. If they fail to secure Xavi Simons, Olmo emerges as a viable alternative, but several factors complicate this potential deal.\n\nBayern Munich's pursuit of Dani Olmo is primarily contingent on their success in acquiring Xavi Simons. As Di Marzio succinctly put it, \"So, I think that Bayern Munich could be interested if they cannot get Xavi Simons.\" This strategic move showcases Bayern's intent to strengthen their squad, but it also underscores the urgency that accompanies such high-stakes negotiations.\n\nOne of the critical hurdles in securing Dani Olmo is the timing of his exit clause. Di Marzio notes, \"The problem with Dani Olmo is the timing of the deal. He has this exit clause ending on July 15 but after the European final, they decided to extend the date to July 20. So teams have 3 more days.\" This brief window adds immense pressure on Bayern Munich to finalize their decision quickly.\n\nFurthermore, Di Marzio emphasises the financial implications: \"But the problem is time because if they don't use the exit clause, Leipzig will want more than \u20ac60 million. They'll ask for \u20ac80 million after his superb performances at EURO 2024. They will ask more.\" The potential increase in Olmo's price tag post-EURO 2024 performances could make the deal significantly more challenging for Bayern Munich.\n\nThe complexities surrounding Dani Olmo's transfer are not lost on Premier League giants Chelsea and Manchester City. Di Marzio explains, \"Manchester City, who had followed him for a lot of days, decided not to activate this clause. Chelsea as well.\" This indicates that despite their interest, both clubs opted not to proceed, possibly due to the tight timeline and financial demands.\n\nBarcelona, another interested party, face its own set of challenges. Di Marzio states, \"Barcelona was interested too but I don't think they can pay two exit clauses, of Dani Olmo and Nico Williams, because of the financial problems that they have.\" This leaves Bayern Munich in a unique position, albeit one fraught with its own pressures.\n\nFor Bayern Munich, the clock is ticking. Di Marzio warns, \"Bayern Munich will have to hurry if they want to get Dani Olmo and I don't think they can manage in three days to do this deal.\" The narrow timeframe necessitates swift and decisive action from Bayern's management.\n\nMoreover, Di Marzio points out logistical challenges: \"Otherwise, Dani Olmo's agents won't be in Spain to do the Morata (Morata and Dani Olmo have the same agents) deal with Milan but in another country. If they are in Madrid now to do the Morata deal, it's because it's the most urgent for his agents.\" This highlights the agents' prioritization of other deals, potentially complicating Bayern's efforts.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

This may well be their most exciting yet, too.\n\nFriday's edition of Spanish publication AS, as relayed by Sport Witness, claims that the Red Devils pushing \"with force\" to sign Dani Olmo. The 26-year-old recently shared the Golden Boot at the Euros.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester City have previously been linked with the La Masia graduate, with TEAMtalk recently claiming that the Reds were favourite for his signature. FourFourTwo understands that there is a release clause in place - but that this expires on July 20.\n\nVIDEO Why England Just Lost The Euro 2024 Final\n\nOlmo has had an intriguing background. He began his career at Barcelona, took a left turn to Dinamo Zagreb and now plays for RB Leipzig. His Euros performances, however, have put him firmly in the shop window with several of Europe's elite eyeing him as a potential option to improve a frontline with his versatility and runs from deep.\n\nIn FourFourTwo's opinion, United are the most ready of any of the prospective suitors to pounce. They've already tied up a few deals and can proceed with much-needed quality in depth - but there may be more appealing options elsewhere.\n\nThe 26-year-old may prefer to play Champions League football this season, with Liverpool, City or even Bayern Munich. With a release clause expiring soon, United may have to act swiftly with this deal or risk paying more for the privilege of signing the player.\n\nOlmo is valued at \u20ac60 million by Transfermarkt. His contract expires in 2027.\n\nManchester United are STILL broken: The unbelievable stat that shows things haven't changed yet for Erik ten Hag\n\nWhich shirt number will Joshua Zirkzee wear at Manchester United?\n\nManchester United eyeing shock England star to partner Kobbie Mainoo in midfield: report", "source": {"uri": "fourfourtwo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fourfourtwo.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_white@fourfourtwo.com", "name": "Mark White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_F.C._1909", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bologna F.C. 1909"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Masia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FourFourTwo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FourFourTwo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNK_Dinamo_Zagreb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GNK Dinamo Zagreb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5JWZMgjjbP6Kcf5KomgWNf-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742402", "eventUri": "eng-9742402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1123, "textEnd": 1130}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

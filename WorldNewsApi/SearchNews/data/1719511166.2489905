So, it\u2019s one of those things where I feel like they\u2019re fighting with themselves,\u201d says Shergill. She says it\u2019s her job to tell them it\u2019s OK. \u201cOnce someone feels seen, heard and understood, that\u2019s when people can feel empowered and motivated and to do the things maybe they\u2019ve been putting off.\u201d Like, embracing the kinky parts of themselves that they\u2019ve denied.

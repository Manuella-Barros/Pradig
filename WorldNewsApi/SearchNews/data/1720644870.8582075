But Trump, whose endorsement is feverishly sought by Senate candidates Sam Brown and Jeff Gunter, has not said for whom voters should cast their ballots. \u201cI\u2019m hearing that he\u2019s staying out of it,\u201d said Amy Tarkanian, the former chairwoman of the Nevada Republican Party. \u201cThe word on the street is that he\u2019s probably not going to endorse in the U.S. Senate race,\u201d Republican pundit and political operative Chuck Muth said during a phone interview. \u201cHe\u2019s just going to stay out of it, which is interesting.\u201d Brown, who lost to Adam Laxalt in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 2022, is the perceived frontrunner in this year\u2019s primary, which includes 13 candidates. Gunter, who served as ambassador to Iceland during Trump\u2019s first term as president, has been feted by Trump, who hosted a March fundraiser for the candidate at Mar-a-Lago, the former president\u2019s resort in Palm Beach, Florida. \u201cI think Trump kind of leans toward Gunter for that reason,\u201d Muth says of their prior relationship. \u201cBut on the other hand, it appears Sam Brown has done everything he needs to be the favorite, and I just don\u2019t think Trump wants to make an endorsement of Gunter if Sam Brown is the likely nominee. He probably doesn\u2019t want to have that on his record.\u201d Early voting in the primary election ends Friday. Election Day is Tuesday, June 11. The winner of the Republican primary will likely face Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, in the general election. \u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of for him to wait until the last minute,\u201d Muth said of Trump. \u201cBut normally he\u2019s gotten behind candidates earlier.\u201d On Monday, Trump endorsed his first and only candidate in Nevada congressional primary races \u2013former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, who is running against two other Republicans in Nevada\u2019s fourth congressional district. The winner will face Democratic incumbent Rep. Steven Horsford in the general election in November. Trump\u2019s campaign in Nevada, which is preparing for a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, declined to comment on his lack of endorsements. \u201cPresident Trump, with his unmatched political acumen, knows exactly who he wants by his side in the Senate,\u201d Gunter said in a statement to the Current. \u201cI have full confidence in his decisions.\u201d Gunter plans to attend Trump\u2019s rally in Las Vegas, though it\u2019s unknown whether he\u2019ll be on stage with the former president or observing from the crowd. \u201cI supported President Trump in 2016 and knocked doors for him in 2020,\u201d Brown said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in his vision for America and I continue to stand with him today.\u201d Brown said he looks forward to working with Trump \u201cand would be honored to receive his endorsement.\u201d A spokeswoman says Brown is adjusting his travel schedule in an effort to attend Trump\u2019s rally. A story Wednesday from Fox News suggests \u201caccusations of \u2018disloyalty\u2019 have taken center stage in the fight, with multiple sources close to Trump and his campaign telling Fox News Digital about an ongoing effort to sway the former president as he considers swooping in to back\u201d Brown or Gunter before the primary. The story suggests there is \u201cbad blood\u201d between Trump and Brown, who failed to endorse Trump until shortly before the Iowa caucus.", "summary": "<p><em>By Dana Gentry, <a href=\"https://nevadacurrent.com/briefs/trump-urges-nevadans-to-vote-in-senate-primary-but-doesnt-say-for-whom/\" target=\"_blank\">Nevada Current</a></em></p>\n\n<p>With two days left for early voting in the primary election and a rally planned in Las Vegas on Sunday, Donald Trump has yet to endorse a candidate in the contentious Republican battle for U.S. Senate.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNevada\u2014there is a very important Republican Primary Election on Tuesday, June 11,&nbsp;for the United States Senate and other important races, and I need you to get out and vote,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112560136796352293\" title=\"\">said</a> Tuesday in a video on Truth Social, the social media platform he owns.

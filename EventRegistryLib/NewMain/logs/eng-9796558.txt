Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) campaigns in Grand Rapids on Aug. 3, 2024. | Lucy Valeski\n\nIn a final campaign push before Tuesday's primary election, U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) on Saturday addressed a couple dozen volunteers at a small bar patio in Grand Rapids.\n\nShe spoke with the West Michigan volunteers individually before explaining her platform and answering questions. Strengthening the middle class, keeping manufacturing and farming in the U.S. and fighting the \"real\" dangers to children, like gun violence, topped her list of priorities.\n\nSlotkin also emphasized the importance of codifying rights, like voting protections and abortion, through Congress instead of relying on the right-wing U.S. Supreme Court. She promised to work on reforming the filibuster to get that work done.\n\nSlotkin also told the Advance she supports reforming the ethics code for the Supreme Court and would be \"open\" to term limits, a change President Joe Biden proposed last month.\n\n\"I think the Democratic Party needs to understand that we can no longer just play defense on our rights and our democracy,\" Slotkin said. \"... I am really sick of playing defense.\"\n\nLongtime U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing) announced her retirement earlier this year, leaving the competitive seat wide open without an incumbent. Slotkin and actor Hill Harper are facing off for the Democratic nomination.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake), former Rep. Justin Amash (I-Cascade Twp.) and Dr. Sherry O'Donnell are competing for the GOP nomination.\n\nSlotkin told the Advance that she believes her experience working in the U.S. House for three terms, the Defense department and on the National Security Council makes her the best choice for the nomination.\n\n\"It's really a sort of competition between rhetoric and substance, and I have the receipts from my time as a congresswoman. I have the receipts from my time in the federal government and national security,\" Slotkin said to the Advance. \"I know what it's like to listen to someone and hear their pain and their story and then translate that into a piece of legislation and then work hard across the aisle to actually get it done.\"\n\nGreg Bowens, a spokesperson for the Harper campaign, said that Harper's experience as a union member, small-business owner, father of a school-aged child, caretaker for his mother and actor has equipped him to understand and work for residents.\n\n\"When it comes to these kinds of experiences and being able to empathize with people in a way that's outside of the government realm, outside of the military industrial complex, outside of war, for example, [it] allows for you to have a more humanistic approach and a more grounded approach in shaping policy decisions,\" Bowens said, pointing to Harper's calls for a ceasefire in Gaza as an example of his empathy in creating his political platform.\n\nWhile Slotkin told volunteers that working with GOP lawmakers was important to passing legislation, she also said that did not mean compromising her values, like defending LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nStrengthening and expanding the middle class is one of Slotkin's keystone priorities. She told volunteers she wants to make higher education and health care more affordable, in addition to creating manufacturing jobs and supporting U.S. farmers.\n\n\"To me, as a multiracial, multiethnic, experiment democracy, if we don't have that, that idea that if you work hard, you will do well and your kids will do better, we're in real trouble,\" Slotkin said.\n\nShe also spoke about addressing dangers that impact children, like gun violence, climate change, mental health issues, drug abuse and poverty. Slotkin clarified that she was only talking about \"real\" issues, and that library books are not a threat to children. Some Republicans in Michigan and across the country have backed banning certain books, often those about LGBTQ+ and racial issues.\n\n\"This idea that either you're a gun owner or you care about children's safety is complete B.S.,\" Slotkin said. \"That is a false choice, and what we need to do is bring our gun owner friends into the conversation on safety.\"\n\nIf Slotkin wins the Democratic nomination this week, she told volunteers she planned to campaign around the state with Stabenow, a la the film, \"Thelma and Louise.\" She said meeting with people all over the state will be important to winning the competitive Senate seat, and Democratic candidates will have to work hard to win over independent voters ahead of the general election in November.\n\n\"It's just trying to be everywhere,\" Slotkin told the Advance. \"People want to know that you're going to show up in their community and listen to their issues. It's just making the point of going to, obviously, much further distances, going to events that mean something to people, meeting with leaders who have a lot to say about their local issues.\"",

But Michigan holds a specific challenge to Ms. Slotkin. She has made her name and reputation as a defense-minded Democrat both in the executive branch of government and in Congress. She is also Jewish and pro-Israel.\n\nMr. Biden's staunch support for Israel created headwinds that may yet still affect Vice President Kamala Harris, whose rapid ascent to the top of the ticket was made official Monday night.\n\nSignificant numbers of Arab American and Muslim voters in and around Detroit registered their dismay with the Biden administration's Middle East policies by voting for \"uncommitted\" delegates in the Michigan presidential primary in February.\n\nMore than 13 percent of Democratic primary voters chose \"uncommitted\" statewide, rather than voting for Mr. Biden. In Wayne County, where more than half of the state's Arab population lives, 79 percent of the vote went to \"uncommitted\" in majority-Arab districts. Ms. Slotkin has shown bipartisan appeal in the last three House elections by winning her swing House district, but Democrats have traditionally won statewide in Michigan by running up the score in Greater Detroit.\n\nRepublicans will try to dent Ms. Slotkin's image of moderation by tying her to Ms. Harris, whom they are portraying as \"dangerously liberal.\" Ms. Slotkin will attend Ms. Harris's rally in Detroit on Wednesday night after avoiding Mr. Biden's most recent appearance in the state.\n\nMr. Rogers will use former President Donald J. Trump's calls for \"America First\" and an end to U.S. adventurism overseas to temper his own past support for a robust foreign policy, including in the Middle East, Republican strategists said.\n\nBut Mr. Rogers has his own problems. He has not held elective office since 2015, and since leaving Congress, he has loosened his connection to Michigan, moving to Florida and registering to vote in Coral Gables.\n\nHe moved back in 2023, but even before the primary on Tuesday, Democrats had begun tarring him as an out-of-touch lobbyist who cashed in on his ties to Capitol Hill for foreign governments, and then moved to Florida. His votes against abortion rights in the House will most likely be a mainstay of Democratic attacks.\n\nBoth Ms. Slotkin and Mr. Rogers faced opponents from the wings of their party in the primaries. Ms. Slotkin's opponent, Hill Harper, was an actor on the television show \"The Good Doctor\" and ran as an outspoken progressive. The Republican primary started off as a seemingly competitive battle royale, but Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Rogers, then prominent contenders such as former Representative Peter Meijer dropped out. That left Mr. Rogers with just one significant challenger, former Representative Justin Amash, a libertarian-minded conservative who was chased from the Republican Party and then from Congress over his fierce criticism of Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Amash's Quixotic third-party run for president in 2020 went nowhere, as did his attempt to rejoin the Republican Party and vie for the Senate.", "source":

Elissa Slotkin and former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers have won their primary races for Michigan's open U.S. Senate seat, CBS News projects.\n\nSlotkin was projected to defeat actor Hill Harper Tuesday, while Rogers was projected to defeat former Rep. Justin Amash and Sherry O'Donnell.\n\nSlotkin and Rogers will now face off in November in the general election for the seat held by Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who announced last year that she would not seek reelection.\n\nFollowing Stabenow's announcement, many candidates announced bids, but that soon narrowed to a handful of people vying for the seat held by Stabenow for more than 20 years.\n\nDemocrats currently maintain a narrow margin in the Senate but are defending far more seats in the November elections. Michigan Republicans haven't secured a Senate victory in Michigan since 1994.\n\nWith Slotkin in the Senate race, her House seat -- Michigan's 7th Congressional District -- is up for grabs. Democratic candidate Curtis Hertel and Republican Tom Barrett, who ran uncontested, will battle in November for that seat.\n\nHarper, who is best known for his role in the TV shows \"CSI: NY\" and \"The Good Doctor,\" told CBS News Detroit earlier this year he wanted to bring something different to Congress as a small business owner and a parent.\n\nRogers has former President Donald Trump's endorsement and the financial backing of national Republicans in the race for his party's nomination. While businessman Sandy Pensler's name was on the ballot, he dropped out of the race in July and has since endorsed Rogers.\n\nThe race has also mirrored many aspects of the U.S. presidential election.

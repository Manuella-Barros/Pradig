I'm always late.'\n\n'Defendants failed to provide any notice to the ticketholders that the Concerts would start much later than the start time printed on the ticket and as advertised, which resulted in the ticketholders waiting for hours for the Concerts to begin at the Venue,' the suit claims.\n\nPer Rolling Stone, 'One of the plaintiffs, Halper-Asefi, spent $992.76 on tickets from StubHub, while the others purchased theirs from Ticketmaster. Conoboy spent $537.70 on two tickets while Monte shelled out $252.44 for two.'\n\nThe lawsuit cited previously examples of Madonna's tardiness.\n\nIn a complaint, filed on Friday in Washington D.C., three ticket buyers accused her of breaking the law by arriving two hours late to both of her shows at the city's Capital One Arena in December (seen in November, 2008)\n\nHer fans, Elizabeth Halper-Asefi, Mary Conoboy, and Nestor Monte, Jr., alleged that while she was scheduled to take the stage at 8:30 p.m., the Queen of Pop didn't begin her set until 10:30 p.m. (seen in 2023)\n\n'There have been myriad articles in the media and the internet over the years of fans complaining about Madonna not taking the stage for several hours after the advertised start time of her concerts,' read the complaint. 'Unfortunately, not all people who rely on advertising for the concerts know this.'\n\nThe complaint also noted that 'even if some ticket purchasers know of Madonna's unfortunate history of starting her concerts late, they do not know how late she will show-up on stage at any particular concert, so ticket purchasers arrived at the start time as advertised.'\n\nUltimately the suit calls her 'deceptive trade practices, a breach of contract for not starting at 8:30, and misrepresentation, among other claims.'\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking damages and 'any other relief.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Madonna's representative, but has not heard back, at this time.\n\nEarlier this month, she fired back at another group of fans that sued her starting her concert three hours late at Brooklyn's Barclays Center on December 13.\n\nAccording to the filing, obtained by Rolling Stone, the D.C. fans said they felt 'deceived' and had 'to leave the concerts early prior to the concerts,' depriving them of experiencing the complete concert that they paid to see\n\nThe lawsuit filed in January, by concertgoers Michael Fellows and Jonathan Hadden, claimed the late starts constitute a 'wanton exercise in false advertising, negligent misrepresentation and unfair and deceptive trade practices.'\n\nCourt documents obtained by DailyMail.com show attorneys for the Material Girl filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing it was illogical for them to expect her to start the show on time.\n\n'No reasonable concertgoer - and certainly no Madonna fan - would expect the headline act at a major arena concert to take the stage at the ticketed event time,' the filing said.\n\n'Fans got just what they paid for: a full-length, high quality show by the Queen of Pop.'\n\nHer attorney's also referenced a Facebook post by Hadden from the day after the concert which he share a photo of the tour poster and said, 'Caught her North American tour opener last night! An homage to NYC! Incredible, as always! I've never missed a Madonna Tour!'\n\n'In other words, the concert met or exceeded his expectations,' said the filing.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the plaintiffs argued it was false advertising that they experienced damages because the concert did not start at the time listed on the ticket.\n\nAdditionally, they accused the Holiday hitmaker of maintaining 'a hot and uncomfortable temperature in the venue during her performance' (seen in 2022)\n\nThey said because the show started much later than expected, it put ticketholders at risk due to 'limited public transportation, limited ride-sharing, and/or increased public and private transportation costs at that late hour.'\n\n'In addition, many ticketholders who attended concerts on a weeknight had to get up early to go to work and/or take care of their family responsibilities the next day,' said the lawsuit.\n\nMadonna's team argued they have nothing to back that up to and said ticketholders who had to stay up late then get up early the next day 'is not cognizable injury.'\n\n'The Complaint itself concedes that Madonna fans, like Mr. Hadden, would not expect Madonna to appear onstage at the printed 8:30 p.m. event time, alleging that she has a \"years-long history\" of \"arriving several hours late to prior concerts,\" such that \"Plaintiffs knew or should have known that the Concerts would not start at 8:30 p.m.,\"' said the filing.\n\n'Reasonable concertgoers also know that concert lengths vary based on numerous factors, such as the duration of the opening act and the artist's set list for the night. So, they would not reasonably expect the night to end by 10:30 p.m. unless an advertisement or ticket says as much -- and none did here.'\n\nThe disgruntled concertgoers declared that these alleged actions represent 'Madonna's arrogant and total disrespect' for ticketholders; seen in 2023\n\n'In essence, Madonna and Live Nation are a consumer's worst nightmare,' the lawsuit states; seen in 2023 on opening night of The Celebration Tour\n\nThe plaintiffs acknowledge Madonna had health issues - she faced a life-threatening bacterial infection last year - which caused the original concert dates to be postponed from July to December - but do not see that as an excuse for the delays on the night.\n\nDespite the delay, she put on a very raunchy show and amazed her fans while performing her 45-song setlist highlighting her record-breaking 40-year career.\n\nLater, it was explained the delay was due to technical issues and had been pushed by only one hour as the opening act, DJ Honey Dijon, took the stage at 8:30 p.m.\n\nThe Queen of Pop eventually took the stage and began her show at 10:45 p.m.\n\nHowever, many of the music icon's fans took to social media to gripe about waiting for the Material Girl hitmaker to begin her show.\n\nOne X user tweeted: 'I don't give a f*** if you're Madonna, if you're 3 hours late, you're just f***ing rude.'\n\n'Concert supposed to start at 8:30. Madonna started at 11pm. Whole arena chanting bulls*** at her lateness. Great show but went way too late,' another person wrote, adding that DJ Honey Dijon opened the show with 'boring house music'.\n\n'2:30 hours late. I WANT A REFUND NOW,' another X user demanded.\n\n'I love Madonna but it's really f***ed up how she's literally like 2 hours late for her FIRST show in the us,' another tweeted.", "source": {"uri":

That case made headlines because it claimed the fans \"had to get up early to go to work\" the next day - a claim Madonna's lawyers have since argued is not the kind of \"cognizable injury\" that can form the basis for a lawsuit.\n\nIn Friday's complaint, which was filed by the same lawyers as the New York case, the fans seemed intent on heading off that same kind of backlash. \"This complaint is not about unhappy fans who don't want to stay up late, but instead, reasonable, responsible people who had commitments to babysitters, work, getting their vehicles out of parking lots that closed at 12:00 midnight, and realizing that public transportation would no longer be operating.\"\n\nLike the previous case, the lawsuit is a proposed class action that aims to represent all fans who experienced similar problems from the late start. A rep for Madonna and Live Nation did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday.\n\nFiled by fans Elizabeth Halper-Asefi, Mary Conoboy, and Nestor Monte, Jr., the new case claims that Dec. 18 and Dec. 19 tour dates on Madonna's Celebration Tour listed an 8:30 p.m. start time, but that the shows did not start until 10:40. When the star finally did take the stage, they say she offered no apologies: \"I am sorry I am late... no, I am not sorry, it's who I am... I'm always late.\"\n\nIn the earlier New York case, Madonna and Live Nation's lawyers have argued that \"no reasonable concertgoer -- and certainly no Madonna fan -- would expect the headline act at a major arena concert to take the stage at the ticketed event time\" and that fans cannot sue over something they knew about when they bought their tickets.\n\nBut in Friday's complaint, lawyers for the D.C. fans called that argument \"absurd.\"\n\n\"In fact, reasonable consumers have seen that concerts featuring Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, whose tours are also promoted by Live Nation, do start on the time indicated on the ticket and have similar experiences attending Broadway theater, NFL football and Major League baseball games,\" the lawyers write.\n\nThe new case includes notable new allegations beyond the delayed start.

When fans allegedly chanted \"A.C.\" at her, they say she responded \"f**k you! I'm cold!...

They're Still Processing What It Means\n\nThree formerly true-blue Madonna fans are now seeing red. They have filed a federal class-action lawsuit in Washington, D.C. against the singer and Live Nation complaining that she was allegedly late getting onstage.\n\nThe fans, Elizabeth Halper-Asefi, Mary Conoboy, and Nestor Monte, Jr., claim that their tickets said the Celebration Tour would begin at 8:30 p.m. but that Madge didn't make an appearance until 10:30 p.m. on each of her D.C. dates in December. The suit echoes another suit alleging Madonna was late to a Brooklyn concert last year.\n\nIn the filing, obtained by Rolling Stone, the D.C. three say they feel \"deceived.\" They also claim that they \"had to leave the concerts early prior to the concerts' conclusion, therefore depriving each of them of the benefit of seeing the complete concert.\" The lawsuit further alleges that Madonna \"maintain[ed] a hot and uncomfortable temperature in the venue during her performance\" and that she \"lip sync[ed] much of her performance.\" These alleged actions, they claim, represent \"Madonna's arrogant and total disrespect\" for ticketholders. \"In essence, Madonna and Live Nation are a consumer's worst nightmare,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nWhen Madonna got onstage at the Dec. 18 D.C. show that the fans were at, the suit claims she told the crowd: \"I am sorry I am late... no, I am not sorry, it's who I am... I'm always late.\"\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, Halper-Asefi, spent $992.76 on tickets from StubHub, while the others purchased theirs from Ticketmaster. Conoboy spent $537.70 on two tickets while Monte shelled out $252.44 for two.\n\n\"Defendants failed to provide any notice to the ticketholders that the Concerts would start much later than the start time printed on the ticket and as advertised, which resulted in the ticketholders waiting for hours for the Concerts to begin at the Venue,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nInterestingly, the suit cites several examples of past Madonna tours where she did not get onstage promptly, including her 2016 Rebel Heart tour and Madame X concerts in Brooklyn, suggesting Madonna's alleged tardiness is well known. \"There have been myriad articles in the media and the internet over the years of fans complaining about Madonna not taking the stage for several hours after the advertised start time of her concerts,\" the complaint reads. \"Unfortunately, not all people who rely on advertising for the concerts know this. Further, even if some ticket purchasers know of Madonna's unfortunate history of starting her concerts late, they do not know how late she will show-up [sic] on stage at any particular concert, so ticket purchasers arrived at the start time as advertised.\" It will be curious to see how the lawyers would argue what they say seems like common knowledge.\n\nThe suit alleges deceptive trade practices, a \"breach of contract\" for not starting at 8:30, and misrepresentation, among other claims. The plaintiffs are seeking damages, interest, and \"any other relief.\"\n\nReps for the plaintiffs and Live Nation did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment. A rep for Madonna declined to comment.\n\nMadonna and Live Nation previously responded to another class action suit that similarly alleged the artist was late getting onstage at a Brooklyn concert a few days before the D.C. dates. \"The shows opened in North America at Barclays in Brooklyn as planned, with the exception of a technical issue Dec. 13 during soundcheck,\" the statement said. \"This caused a delay that was well documented in press reports at the time.

Three fans have filed a class-action lawsuit in Washington, D.C., against Madonna and Live Nation.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThe suit claims that the tickets for two December dates of Madonna's Celebration Tour stated the show would start at 8:30 p.m., but allegedly she didn't appear until almost 10:30 p.m. This is similar to a suit filed last year concerning a late concert in Brooklyn.\n\nAccording to a report from Rolling Stone, who obtained a copy of the suit, the three fans feel \"deceived\" by Live Nation and Madonna. Additionally, because of the late start, they \"had to leave the concerts early prior to the concerts' conclusion, therefore depriving each of them of the benefit of seeing the complete concert.\"\n\nTo add insult to injury for Madonna, the suit claims she \"maintain[ed] a hot and uncomfortable temperature in the venue during her performance\" and \"lip sync[ed] much of her performance.\" The fans claim Madonna's actions represent her \"arrogant and total disrespect\" for fans. The suit concludes, \"In essence, Madonna and Live Nation are a consumer's worst nightmare.\"\n\n[RELATED: Madonna Lashes Out at Production Staff for Not Turning off Air Conditioning: \"Gonna Have to Dock Your Pay\"]\n\nMadonna Sued Again for Being Late to Her Own Shows\n\nAccording to the suit, when Madonna eventually appeared onstage, she announced, \"I am sorry I am late... no, I am not sorry, it's who I am... I'm always late.\" The suit also included the prices the three plaintiffs paid for their tickets.\n\nOne fan paid $992.76 on StubHub, while the others paid $537.70 and $252.44 on Ticketmaster, both for a pair of tickets. The lawsuit states that neither the D.C. venue, Madonna, nor Live Nation gave ticketholders any advance notice that the shows would start later than advertised.\n\nThere are also documented instances of Madonna being tardy to her own shows in the past. Notably, she was late to Brooklyn shows on her 2016 Rebel Heart Tour and 2019 Madame X Tour. \"There have been myriad articles in the media and the internet over the years of fans complaining about Madonna not taking the stage for several hours after the advertised start time of her concerts,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nPer the lawsuit, the plaintiffs are seeking damages, interest, and \"any other relief\" from Madonna and Live Nation. A footnote on the lawsuit reads, per Rolling Stone, \"This Complaint is not about unhappy fans who don't want to stay up late, but instead, reasonable, responsible people who had commitments to babysitters, work, getting their vehicles out of parking lots that closed at 12:00 midnight, and realizing that public transportation would no longer be operating.\"\n\nFeatured Image by Theo Wargo/Getty Images for MTV/ViacomCBS", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_boisvert@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Lauren Boisvert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Live Nation Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lip sync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_X_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madame X Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Heart_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebel Heart Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ticketmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StubHub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "StubHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Madonna-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503169", "eventUri": "eng-9503169", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

I guess she just can't get into the groove! Her clock is on holiday! The stage manager says \"We only got four minutes\" but Madge doesn't listen! Oh, I crack myself up. Madonna was sued in January by two concertgoers for starting her Dec. 13 Brooklyn show more than two hours late. Now three attendees of her Dec. 18 show in DC have filed another suit over Madonna's tardiness. The kicker with this one is that Madame X started out the DC concert by rescinding an apology for the two hour delay. Your honor, Exhibit A: \"It's who I am... I'm always late.\"\n\nSeeing red: Three formerly true-blue Madonna fans are now seeing red. They have filed a federal class-action lawsuit in Washington, D.C. against the singer and Live Nation complaining that she was allegedly late getting onstage. The fans, Elizabeth Halper-Asefi, Mary Conoboy, and Nestor Monte, Jr., claim that their tickets said the Celebration Tour would begin at 8:30 p.m. but that Madge didn't make an appearance until 10:30 p.m. on each of her D.C. dates in December.\n\n'A consumer's worst nightmare': In the filing, obtained by Rolling Stone, the D.C. three say they feel \"deceived.\" They also claim that they \"had to leave the concerts early prior to the concerts' conclusion, therefore depriving each of them of the benefit of seeing the complete concert.\" The lawsuit further alleges that Madonna \"maintained[ed] a hot and uncomfortable temperature in the venue during her performance\" and that she \"lip sync[ed] much of her performance.\" These alleged actions, they claim, represent \"Madonna's arrogant and total disrespect\" for ticketholders. \"In essence, Madonna and Live Nation are a consumer's worst nightmare,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nSorry, not sorry: When Madonna got onstage at the Dec. 18 D.C. show that the fans were at, the suit claims she told the crowd: \"I am sorry I am late... no, I am not sorry, it's who I am... I'm always late.\" One of the plaintiffs, Halper-Asefi, spent $992.76 on tickets from StubHub, while the others purchased theirs from Ticketmaster. Conoboy spent $537.70 on two tickets while Monte shelled out $252.44 for two. \"Defendants failed to provide any notice to the ticketholders that the Concerts would start much later than the start time printed on the ticket and as advertised, which resulted in the ticketholders waiting for hours for the Concerts to begin at the venue,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nA pattern of behavior: Interestingly, the suit cites several examples of past Madonna tours where she did not get onstage promptly, including her 2016 Rebel Heart tour and Madame X concerts in Brooklyn, suggesting Madonna's alleged tardiness is well known. \"There have been myriad articles in the media and the internet over the years of fans complaining about Madonna not taking the stage for several hours after the advertised start time of her concerts,\" the complaint reads. \"Unfortunately, not all people who rely on advertising for the concerts know this. Further, even if some ticket purchasers know of Madonna's unfortunate history of starting her concerts late, they do not know how late she will show-up [sic] on stage at any particular concert, so ticket purchasers arrived at the start time as advertised.\"\n\nRead the footnote: A lawyer for the plaintiffs directed Rolling Stone to a footnote from the filing that states, \"This Complaint is not about unhappy fans who don't want to stay up late, but instead, reasonable, responsible people who had commitments to babysitters, work, getting their vehicles out of parking lots that closed at 12:00 midnight, and realizing that public transportation would no longer be operating.\"\n\n[From Rolling Stone]\n\nMost of the arguments here are the same as with the other lawsuit. With that first one, I was going back and forth on whether it's effective for the plaintiffs to harp on Madonna's history of starting shows late. My concern was that they were making themselves vulnerable to the counter-argument that if she's notorious for being late, shouldn't the concertgoers have anticipated that possibility? But I've come around now, especially with seeing the ticket prices included in the filing. People have a right to expect the show to start at the time it says on the ticket, so that they can make all other logistical arrangements AND get to see the whole show.

Three fans claim that the singer broke the law by arriving on stage two hours late at a pair of gigs at the Capital One Arena in December 2023.\n\nThe complaint, which also names entertainment giant Live Nation as a defendant, claims that the delayed starts to the 'Celebration Tour' concerts constitute \"a wanton exercise in false advertising\".\n\nLawyers for the fans wrote: \"Forcing consumers to wait hours for her performance in a hot, uncomfortable arena is demonstrative of Madonna's arrogant and total disrespect for her fans.\n\n\"In essence, Madonna and Live Nation are a consumer's worst nightmare.\"\n\nThey added: \"This complaint is not about unhappy fans who don't want to stay up late, but instead, reasonable, responsible people who had commitments to babysitters, work, getting their vehicles out of parking lots that closed at 12:00 midnight, and realising that public transportation would no longer be operating.\"\n\nThe suit is a proposed class action that aims to represent all ticketholders who experienced similar problems from the late starts.\n\nIn the case, the three fans - Elizabeth Halper-Asefi, Mary Conoboy, and Nestor Monte, Jr. - claim that Madonna did not take to the stage until 10:40pm - over two hours later that the scheduled start time of 8:30pm.\n\nAccording to the suit, the Queen Of Pop told those in attendance: \"I am sorry I am late... no, I am not sorry, it's who I am... I'm always late.\"\n\nRecently, Madonna asked the court to dismiss a similar lawsuit filed against her in New York on the grounds of late concert start times.\n\nThe star and Live Nation's lawyers argued that \"no reasonable concertgoers - and certainly no Madonna fan - would expect the headline act at a major arena concert to take the stage at the ticketed event time\"\n\nAdditionally, they said fans could not take legal action over something they knew about when they purchased their tickets.\n\nLawyers for the new D.C. case called that argument \"absurd\", writing: \"In fact, reasonable consumers have seen that concerts featuring Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, whose tours are also promoted by Live Nation, do start on the time indicated on the ticket and have similar experiences attending Broadway theatre, NFL football and Major League baseball games.\"\n\nThe suit also claims that the arena was \"uncomfortably hot\", and that Madonna herself had insisted on the temperature. Fans are said to have chanted \"A.C\" at the star, but she allegedly responded: \"Fuck you! I'm cold!... If you're hot, take your fucking clothes off!\"\n\nIt comes after she hit out at production staff for running the air conditioning at one of her recent shows in Miami, Florida.\n\nElsewhere, the new case accuses Madonna of lip-synching some parts of her D.C. performances - which it says is another case of false advertising: \"Had plaintiffs and other class members known that [...] the performer would be lip-synching, they would not have purchased their tickets.\"\n\nLast October, Madonna's musical director Stuart Price insisted that the icon's singing on her 'Celebration Tour' was \"all live vocal\".\n\nA representative for Madonna and Live Nation has not yet responded to the new claims.\n\nThe artist's career-spanning trek is due to conclude with a huge free concert in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on May 4, marking her biggest show ever.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors":

In that case, Madonna's lawyers have said that doesn't qualify as the type of \"injury\" required to support a lawsuit.\n\nThe D.C.-area suit specifies, \"This Complaint is not about unhappy fans who don't want to stay up late, but instead, reasonable, responsible people who had commitments to babysitters, work, getting their vehicles out of parking lots that closed at 12:00 midnight, and realizing that public transportation would no longer be operating.\"\n\nAccording to the suit, at the Dec. 18 show, when Madonna finally took the stage, she allegedly said \"I am sorry I am late...no, I am not sorry, it's who I am... I'm always late.\"\n\nMadonna and Live Nation have said it's not reasonable for concert-goers to believe that the 8:30 p.m. start time on the ticket indicates that's when the show will begin and that no concerts begin on the start time advertised.\n\n\"This is absurd.

The lawsuit comes just weeks after Madonna filed a motion to dismiss a similar case concerning tour dates in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThe second lawsuit was filed in DC federal court last Friday (April 19), according to Billboard. Three fans claim that the singer broke the law by arriving on stage two hours late at two performance dates at the Capital One Arena in December 2023.\n\nComplainants accused Madonna and entertainment giant Live Nation of exercising \"false advertising\" by listing the time on the ticket as 8.30pm, when the singer reportedly arrived on stage at approximately 10.40pm instead.\n\nLawyers for the fans wrote: \"Forcing consumers to wait hours for her performance in a hot, uncomfortable arena is demonstrative of Madonna's arrogant and total disrespect for her fans.\n\n\"In essence, Madonna and Live Nation are a consumer's worst nightmare.\"\n\nThey added: \"This complaint is not about unhappy fans who don't want to stay up late, but instead, reasonable, responsible people who had commitments to babysitters, work, getting their vehicles out of parking lots that closed at 12.00 midnight, and realising that public transportation would no longer be operating.\"\n\nAccording to the filing, when the \"Like A Prayer\" singer arrived on stage, she told those in attendance: \"I am sorry I am late... no, I am not sorry, it's who I am... I'm always late.\"\n\nThe Independent has contacted Madonna's representatives for comment.\n\nIt comes weeks after Madonna filed a motion to dismiss a similar lawsuit, which fans in Brooklyn filed against Madonna and Lice Nation in January for a show on 13 December where she reportedly arrived on stage two hours later than expected.\n\nAccording to court filings, Madonna's lawyers called to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the fans' claim of having to \"get up early to go to work\" after the concert ended at 1am was not an \"injury\" worth damages.\n\nLawyers also argued that a fan wouldn't expect Madonna to appear on stage for her Celebration tour at the time printed on the ticket as she had \"years-long history\" or \"arriving several hours late to prior concerts\".\n\nThey also pointed out that \"nowhere\" on the ticket did it advertise that Madonna would start the show at 8.30pm and no reasonable concertgoer could expect the headline act to take the stage at the ticketed time.\n\n\"Rather, a reasonable concertgoer would understand that the venue's doors will open at or before the ticketed time, one or more opening acts may perform while attendees arrive and make their way to their seats and before the headline act takes the stage, and the headline act will take the stage later in the evening,\" they argued.\n\nThe fans claimed they would not have paid for tickets had they known what time Madonna would arrive on stage.\n\nThey argued that the delay, which they alleged happened again at the singer's subsequent shows in Brooklyn on 14 December and 16 December, was a \"wanton exercise in false advertising, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair and deceptive trade practices\".\n\nThey claimed the show ended at 1am, leaving them with \"limited public transportation, limited ridesharing, and/or increased public and private transportation costs\". Some were left \"stranded in the middle of the night\", they said.\n\nThroughout her Celebration tour, Madonna has given fans an autobiographical insight into her life and career, detailing her sexual awakening, her punk roots, her experiences before becoming famous, and her friendship with Michael Jackson.\n\nIn The Independent's five-star review of the tour, critic Helen Brown writes that the tour is a reminder of why the \"Queen of Pop still reigns\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Live Nation Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_One_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital One Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "False advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Prayer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Like a Prayer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autobiography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/23/10/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503169", "eventUri": "eng-9503169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-14", "dateEnd": "-12-16", "textStart": 3102, "textEnd": 3129}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-13", "textStart": 1820, "textEnd": 1831}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 416, "textEnd": 424}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Their allegations include accusations of lip-syncing - another instance of false advertising, according to their lawyers.\n\nThe legal move follows a similar case filed by two fans who attended one of the star's three shows at New York's Barclays Center, also in December. The latest move to sue the star was filed on behalf of three unhappy fans at her two Washington concerts. Both suits have been brought by the same lawyers. Concert promoters Live Nation are named as a defendant in both cases.\n\nIn the D.C. complaint, the trio of fans state that the Queen of Pop started her 18 and 19 December performances at the Capital One Arena at 10:40pm, more than two hours after the advertised 8:30pm start time, which they say was \"a wanton exercise in false advertising.\"\n\n\"Forcing consumers to wait hours for her performance in a hot, uncomfortable arena is demonstrative of Madonna's arrogant and total disrespect for her fans,\" states the lawsuit.\n\n\"No reasonable concertgoer -- and certainly no Madonna fan -- would expect the headline act at a major arena concert to take the stage at the ticketed event time\"\n\nThe Washington concerts plaintiffs - Elizabeth Halper-Asefi, Mary Conoboy, and Nestor Monte, Jr. - say, \"This complaint is not about unhappy fans who don't want to stay up late, but instead, reasonable, responsible people who had commitments to babysitters, work, getting their vehicles out of parking lots that closed at 12:00 midnight, and realizing that public transportation would no longer be operating.\"\n\nIn response to the earlier New York lawsuit, Madonna and Live Nation's lawyers claimed that fans attending concerts by the 65-year-old should not expect her, or any other headliner, to start the concerts at the advertised start time. \"No reasonable concertgoer -- and certainly no Madonna fan -- would expect the headline act at a major arena concert to take the stage at the ticketed event time,\" countered the defendants' legal team, further arguing that fans cannot sue over something they were aware of before they bought their tickets.\n\nHowever, in an effort to avoid similar arguments, the lawyers for the D.C. plaintiffs noted in court papers, \"Reasonable consumers have seen that concerts featuring Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, whose tours are also promoted by Live Nation, do start on the time indicated on the ticket and have similar experiences attending Broadway theater, NFL football and Major League baseball games.\"", "source": {"uri": "iq-mag.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "IQ Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gordon_masson@iq-mag.net", "name": "Gordon Masson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_One_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capital One Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "False advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lip sync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live Nation Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Springsteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Laser_Games/LaZerware", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Laser Games/LaZerware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Laser_Games/Arenas", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Laser Games/Arenas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Arenas", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Arenas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.iq-mag.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Madonna.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503169", "eventUri": "eng-9503169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-18", "dateEnd": "-12-19", "textStart": 1089, "textEnd": 1107}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

It also accuses the defendants of failing to disclose that Madonna \"would lip synch much of her performance,\" and of mainting \"a hot and uncomfortable temperature in the venue\" during the show.\n\n\"Madonna and Live Nation have publicly stated that it is not reasonable for\n\nconsumers to believe that the 8:30 start time on the ticket indicates that's when the concert will begin and that no concerts start on the start time as advertised,\" the suit says.

filed a motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit filed by two fans in January after one of her Celebration Tour concerts in New York City started hours later than scheduled.\n\nIn the original lawsuit, two concertgoers claimed that the show, which took place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on 13 December, started at 10:30 p.m., even though the tickets listed the show as starting at 8:30 p.m.\n\nIn their motion to dismiss, Madonna's legal team insisted that a two-hour delay did not warrant a lawsuit.\n\n\"Plaintiffs speculate that ticketholders who left the venue after 1 a.m. might have had trouble getting a ride home or might have needed to wake up early the next day for work,\" the hitmaker's lawyers stated at the time. \"That is not a cognizable injury.\"", "source": {"uri":

The third and final plaintiff appears to be a schoolteacher.\n\nRegardless of how exactly these purported Madonna fans found their way into the questionable suit, Live Nation will undoubtedly refute the allegations (in the courtroom, that is) sooner rather than later. The Ticketmaster parent, which has rightfully faced criticism for genuine operational shortcomings over the years, moved to dismiss the older late-start lawsuit closer to April's beginning.\n\nIn addition to pushing back against the claims, Live Nation in its dismissal motion noted Ticketmaster's ironclad arbitration clause. Bearing that point in mind, the newer suit expressly emphasizes that one plaintiff (the same person who dropped close to $1,000 to attend, as mentioned) purchased the Madonna tickets via StubHub.\n\nShare on:\n\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link", "source": {"uri": "digitalmusicnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Music News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dylan_smith@digitalmusicnews.com", "name": "Dylan Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lip sync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live Nation Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrepresentation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misrepresentation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "False advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ticketmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StubHub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "StubHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-box_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big-box store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fans-sue-madonna-live-nation-for-starting-show-two-hours-late-feat.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503169", "eventUri": "eng-9503169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-18", "dateEnd": "-12-19", "textStart": 661, "textEnd": 683}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Madonna, they allege in the suit, didn't start the show until well after 10 p.m., two hours later than advertised, both nights.\n\n\"Forcing consumers to wait hours for her performance in a hot, uncomfortable arena is demonstrative of Madonna's arrogance and total disrespect for her fans,\" the fans' attorney, David Greenbaum, wrote. \"In essence, Madonna and Live Nation are a consumer's worst nightmare.\"\n\n\"This complaint is not about unhappy fans who don't want to stay up late, but instead, reasonable, responsible people who had commitments to babysitters, work, getting their vehicles out of parking lots that closed at 12:00 midnight, and realizing that public transportation would no longer be operating,\" the suit continues. Of course, this isn't the only class action filing against the notoriously late singer.\n\nIn January, two other attendees filed a class-action lawsuit against the singer for -- once again -- taking the stage two hours later than advertised. In the filing, Michael Fellows and Jonathan Hadden claim Madonna's \"flippant difficulty\" caused them to suffer a series of inconveniences in the wee hours of the morning that included being \"confronted with limited public transportation, limited ride-sharing, and/or increased public and private transportation costs at that late hour.\"\n\nThe concerts at the center of the controversial suit occurred on December 13, 14, and 16 (a Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday) at Brooklyn's Barclays Center -- all of which were publicized as beginning at 8:30 p.m. Fellows and Hadden's suit accuses Madonna of false advertising and negligent misrepresentation as she didn't start the show until after 10:30 p.m. on all three nights.\n\nNow, we all know Madonna has been through a lot recently. After she was found unresponsive in July 2023 following \"a serious bacterial infection which led to a several-day stay in the ICU,\" the tour was postponed so technically, it's a wonder it's happening at all.

The incident was said to have taken place \"years ago.\"\n\nRichard Madeley revealed that Madonna made him and his wife Judy Finnigan wait six hours for a scheduled chat\n\n\"She was six hours late for the interview\", he remembered, \"we didn't start until about one in the morning.

She was weird.\"\n\nThe Queen of Pop is facing intense backlash after three fans took legal action against her for being two hours late to a recent concert in Washington DC. In their filing, which was obtained by Rolling Stone, the fans stated they felt \"deceived\" by the singer, claiming they \" had to leave the concerts early\" which deprived each of them \"of the benefit of seeing the complete concert.\" The Daily Mirror has reached out to Madonna's representatives for comment.\n\nThis isn't the first time Madonna has come under fire for her supposed lack of punctuality. In January, two fans named Michael Fellows and Jonathan Hadden launched a legal battle of their own after attending one of the star's concerts in Brooklyn's Barclays Center, New York, in late 2023. The pair complained that they \"would not have paid for tickets\" if they had known Madonna would be more than two hours late to her own show.\n\nLegal documents by the duo stated: \"many ticketholders who attended concerts on a weeknight had to get up early to go to work and/or take care of their family responsibilities the next day.\" Michael and Jonathan sued Live Nation and the Barclays Center for \"false advertising, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair and deceptive trade practices.\"\n\nAt the time, Madonna's representatives and promoter Live Nation had responded to the allegations with a joint statement sharing their intent \"to defend this case vigorously.\" They also claimed that, while previous shows in Brooklyn opened as anticipated, the December 13th performance at the Barclays Center had been delayed by a technical issue.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs onTikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_carreno@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Laura Carreno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Madeley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Madeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Finnigan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judy Finnigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breakfast television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgin Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Susanna Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live Nation Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32660580.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Richard-Madeley-main.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503169", "eventUri": "eng-9503169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-13", "textStart": 2950, "textEnd": 2963}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

So that's the deception,\" said Marcus Corwin, an attorney representing three fans in the class action lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said Madonna and Live Nation withheld information that she would maintain a hot and uncomfortable temperature during her performance and that she would lip-synch much of her performance.\n\n\"I agreed with a lot of the points that they actually made.

What's going on?!'\n\nLorraine's swipe came not long after she compared the Like a Virgin singer to a 'boiled egg'.\n\nMetro.co.uk previously reached out to Live Nation and the Barclays Center for comment.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Last episode of Sh\u014dgun had alternate ending cut from finale for being 'false'\n\nMORE : WWE's Rhea Ripley has savage 8-word response after replacement champion is crowned", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_lawes@metro.co.uk", "name": "Ruth Lawes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susanna Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_Up", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung Up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Finnigan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judy Finnigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Material Girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live Nation Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Virgin_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Like a Virgin (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barclays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_(TV_programme)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorraine (TV programme)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEC_201091487-fce2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C2400px%2C1261px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503169", "eventUri": "eng-9503169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-13", "textStart": 1507, "textEnd": 1518, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

There are four shows left to take place in Europe and two shows left in London - on Tuesday, December 5 and Wednesday, December 6.\n\nMadonna's first show on Saturday, October 14 started with a powerful rendition of her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters before she told the crowd: \"Am I imagining this? Oh my God, it is so good to be back, London.\"\n\nPerforming at the O2 Arena, she explained that the concert would \"tell the story\" of her life \"through music and dance\", starting from how she arrived in New York with 25 dollars in her pocket and ended up becoming the best-selling female solo touring artist of all time.\n\nBut fans weren't very pleased after both the first and second shows. During the second show, the 65-year-old singer suddenly stopped performing at 11pm, ditching four songs on her setlist.\n\nThe show was cut short because Madonna was late for the show, meaning it ran over the venue's 10.30pm Sunday curfew.\n\nAnd the pattern of bad time-keeping didn't stop there. Fans took to social media to share that Madonna was late for her Milan show on Saturday, November 25.\n\nAnother fan commented on the speculation that the first concert in Milan had a delayed start because Donatella Versace organised a party with her son Marco Mengoni.\n\nThe exact time Madonna will be on stage hasn't been announced, but doors will open at 6.30 pm across all six scheduled concerts.\n\nSo far, her London shows have seen Madonna come on stage between 8:50pm and 9:05pm. O2 shows usually end at 11pm for weekday events, while Sunday shows finish at 10.30pm.\n\nThe concerts on October 14 and October 15 saw the Queen of Pop kick off the festivities with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters before moving through hits from her back catalogue including Into The Groove.\n\nFrom Burning Up and Open Your Heart to Holiday and Like A Prayer, her setlist included some of her most famous songs.\n\nAhead of the concerts, Stuart Price, one of music's most in-demand producers, gave an insight into what the shows would consist of.\n\nHe told the BBC the show draws on four decades of archive footage and studio recordings. \"A greatest hit doesn't have to be a song,\" he said.\n\nPrice had added that finalising the setlist was \"the big challenge\".\n\nFans can expect many of the songs to be played in full, while some will be merged into other songs, and others will be used as \"bridges\" between acts.\n\nPrice had suggested that a ballpark figure of 25 songs would be performed in full, with elements of 20 others appearing in some form.\n\n\"There's one thing that's always dynamic, and that's Madonna herself. Her personality is so strong, her interaction with the audience is so strong, that it creates opportunities for variation from night to night,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concert tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Really_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nothing Really Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_O2_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The O2 Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatella_Versace", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donatella Versace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Mengoni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Mengoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Your_Heart_(Madonna_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open Your Heart (Madonna song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Prayer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Like a Prayer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Up_(Madonna_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burning Up (Madonna song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_(Madonna_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holiday (Madonna song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Price", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Groove", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Into the Groove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/3d5164ba17c5ca12370406da60ec31d8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503169", "eventUri": "eng-9503169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-14", "dateEnd": "-10-15", "textStart": 1620, "textEnd": 1645}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-05", "textStart": 144, "textEnd": 154}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-06", "textStart": 170, "textEnd": 180}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-14", "textStart": 217, "textEnd": 227}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-25", "textStart": 1122, "textEnd": 1133}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

She was previously sued in New York by Michael Fellows and Jonathan Hadden for \"unconscionable, unfair, and/or deceptive trade practices\" after starting her \"Celebration Tour\" Brooklyn stop late.\n\nMadonna's concert was advertised as beginning at 8:30 p.m., but the \"Material Girl\" singer did not make it to the stage until 10:30 p.m. on all three nights at the Barclays Center, according to the court docs.\n\n\"Madonna had demonstrated flippant difficulty in ensuring a timely or complete performance, and Defendants were aware that any statement as to a start time for a show constituted, at best, optimistic speculation,\" the lawsuit alleged.\n\nMadonna's legal team has since filed a motion to dismiss the class action suit.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nMadonna is notoriously late for her concerts and was sued in 2019 for pushing back a Madame X tour stop in Miami. A fan attempted to get a refund after the concert had been rescheduled from the original start time of 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., NBC reported.\n\nTicketholders had to work and go to school the next day, which prevented them from attending a concert that would end at around 1:00 a.m.,\" the suit claimed, according to the outlet. \"(Nate) Hollander attempted, without success, to obtain a refund for the three tickets purchased for the Madonna concert.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMadonna also took the stage late on the opening night of the Celebration Tour in the U.S., December 13. A source familiar with the matter told FOX Business that Madonna had been about an hour late for the concert in Brooklyn. The pop star sound-checked nearly until the doors opened at 7:30 p.m., the insider said.\n\nAt one point during the concert, Madonna asked the crowd whether they could hear her, because she was hearing an echo in her earpiece, the source explained.\n\nMadonna's Celebration Tour, which also marked her 40-year anniversary in the entertainment industry, was postponed in July 2023 after the star suffered a \"serious bacterial infection\" that required an ICU stay in June.\n\nShe eventually took the stage in December following her recovery.\n\nMadonna recently spoke with W Magazine about life on tour with her kids, saying, \"nothing brings me more happiness than to know we are all working on the same show, creating the magic together.\"\n\nThe mother of six explained, \"It would be boring if they were just traveling from hotel to hotel, and occasionally coming to watch the show. Of course, I am their mother, so sometimes we get on each other's nerves. We are a family of artists, but we are also a family, and that's what happens.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxbusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauryn_overhultz@foxbusiness.com", "name": "Lauryn Overhultz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live Nation Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "False advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_X_(album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madame X (album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Material Girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "W (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2024/04/1024/512/Madonna.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503169", "eventUri": "eng-9503169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "dateEnd": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 73, "textEnd": 88}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-13", "textStart": 2257, "textEnd": 2268}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 451769230, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 29, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 29}}}

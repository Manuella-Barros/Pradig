These strategic partnerships in a world fueled by outsmarting and outmaneuvering those operating in the same space seem unlikely. Why would marketing agencies trying to stand out from the competition join forces? Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to draw a line in the sand and keep what\u2019s yours separate? Building partnerships with competing marketing agencies might not seem like an astute move, but it can be under certain circumstances. Playing nicely with others could help you gain clients, resources and allies during tough times. If you\u2019re wondering how strategic partnerships with competing marketing agencies could work, here are some words of advice. Exchange Leads No, exchanging leads with competing marketing agencies isn\u2019t a crazy idea. Here\u2019s why. The percentage of ad agencies in the U.S. is growing. That percentage has gone up by an average of 2.4 points each year between 2018 and 2023. In America, there were 13,998 agencies as of 2023. Not all of these agencies will offer the same services or have identical expertise. While some fellow marketers will be direct competitors, quite a few will be indirect competitors. They\u2019re like your first or second cousin once removed. You share some of the same genetic characteristics, but clear differences also exist. These similarities and differences represent opportunities to funnel leads for services you may not offer. Say your agency specializes in rebranding. Your team can whip up campaigns that include videos, blogs, press releases and social posts. However, you don\u2019t have the resources to extend those campaigns to clients\u2019 websites.

You introduce clients to a trusted agency with website design and management skills. In exchange, you receive leads looking to breathe new life into their brands. Share Knowledge It might seem counterintuitive, but the idea of a competitive landscape isn\u2019t to edge everyone else out. Competition is supposed to prevent monopolization of a market while motivating organizations to improve. In theory, operating in the same space as competitors drives innovation, creates better products and gives consumers more choices. Observing what competing marketing agencies are doing helps you see the bigger picture. You get out of your bubble and learn what\u2019s happening in your market. There could be forces and conditions you\u2019ve overlooked or didn\u2019t think would turn out to be much. Competitors\u2019 successes and knowledge can help you learn new insights. While divulging trade secrets and other proprietary info won\u2019t be on the table, you could share wisdom gained from experience. Say your agency is running into roadblocks with client growth. It might be convenient to cite research about a tough economy and smaller budgets. Yet your competition could shed light on growth strategies when clients tighten their belts. Agencies might also share recommendations for new tools that help discover target audiences. Be a Cheerleader Your competitor doesn\u2019t have to lose for your agency to win. This mindset goes against what you may have surmised from any competition, including sports. One side wins the game and the other loses. And someone has to come in first and last when there\u2019s a race. But when the mindset of winning because of a competitor\u2019s loss transfers to the business world, the real loser is the consumer. If companies like Apple and Microsoft can\u2019t succeed in the same space, there\u2019s less variety, innovation and competitive pricing. You might be surprised to learn the two rivals formed a collaborative partnership in 1997. This agreement allowed Mac users to benefit from Microsoft\u2019s productivity tools and gave Apple the cash it needed to survive. The two tech giants still collaborate to this day, integrating select software tools and services for consumers\u2019 benefit. If former bitter rivals like Apple and Microsoft can find ways to collaborate, so can competing marketing agencies. Being each other\u2019s cheerleader can open up opportunities to create advantages for both partners and clients. It is possible to redefine the rules of the game so each side wins. Collaborating With the Competition Partnerships with other agencies shatter traditional notions of cutthroat competition. When your end goal is survival of the fittest, working with your competition seems detrimental. But even opposing political parties must reach across the aisle to get things done for their constituents. Maintaining conventional notions of win-lose can ultimately make everyone lose, including your clients. You don\u2019t have to collaborate with every competitor, but under certain conditions, rival marketing agencies can become stronger together. By complimenting each other\u2019s strengths and filling market gaps, you\u2019ll discover opportunities to play nicely. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website.

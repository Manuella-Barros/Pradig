They might have a harder time obtaining consent to an interview at all. It is clearly not in the public interest to render such cooperation with prosecutors and investigators less likely in the future.'\n\nThe letter said that the Oversight and Judiciary committees have not identified any valid reasoning for needing the audio of the interview in addition to transcripts.\n\nStill, the GOP disagreed.\n\nOversight Chairman James Comer clapped back in a statement: 'The Biden Administration does not get to determine what Congress needs and does not need for its oversight of the executive branch.'\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Hur testified before the Judiciary Committee about his report on President Joe Biden in March\n\nHur, in a report explaining his decision not to prosecute Biden over mishandling classified documents, sparked opposition from all sides - Republicans who questioned why he would not charge the president and Democrats who took issue with his description of Biden as a 'sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.'\n\n'The February 27 subpoenas create a legal obligation on you to produce this material,' the GOP lawmakers wrote to Garland. 'If you fail to do so, the Committees will consider taking further action, such as the invocation of contempt of Congress proceedings.'\n\nThe Justice Department has only said it is conducting an 'interagency review' for classified and confidential information within the material.\n\nHur said he found that Biden had 'willfully' retained classified material but stopped short of filing charges, believing a jury would not convict the president.\n\nHe explained his decision to make the assessment in the hearing: 'I knew that for my position to be credible. I could not simply announce that there would be no charges, I needed to explain why. I needed to show my work.'\n\n'We identified evidence that the President willfully retained classified materials after the end of his vice presidency, when he was a private citizen,' Hur said during a high-stakes hearing in April.\n\nIn interviews with investigators, Biden became muddled about the dates he was vice president and could not even remember the year in which his son Beau died, according to the transcript reviewed by DailyMail.com.\n\nThe box circled in the foreground contained documents about Afghanistan. The picture was taken in December 2022 in Biden's garage, with other household items\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Hur spent a year investigating files found at President Joe Biden's home and former office. He said Biden's status as president meant he could not be prosecuted\n\nBiden forgot the year Beau died, when Trump was elected and said 'I don't recall', 'I don't remember' and 'I have no goddamn idea' more than 100 times while cracking jokes and making car noises with the investigators.\n\nAnd it said his cavalier attitude to classified documents, such as his habit of reading sensitive files to a ghostwriter, posed a significant national security risk.\n\nOne of the reasons they decided not to press charges was because 'at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.'\n\nHur said during testimony that he described Biden this way because of his 'inability to recall certain things' and that he had to be prompted by his lawyers to recall certain dates.\n\nAccording to transcripts of Hur's interviews with Biden on October 8 and October 9, 2023, Biden's lawyer had to tell him what year his son Beau died of brain cancer and the president joked about the special counsel finding pictures of his wife Jill in a swimsuit.\n\nI just hope you didn't find any risqu\u00e9 pictures of my wife in a bathing suit. Which you probably did. She's beautiful,' said Biden.\n\n'What month did Beau die?' Biden mused at one point, adding, 'Oh God, May 30th.'\n\n'He did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died. And his memory appeared hazy when describing the Afghanistan debate that was once so important to him,' Hur said.\n\nA White House lawyer then chimed in with the year, 2015.\n\n'Was it 2015 he died?' Biden asked.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

In his final report, Hur decided against pursuing charges against Biden but described the president as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" who would be sympathetic to a jury, infuriating the White House and Biden's allies.\n\nHouse Republicans have repeatedly pressed the Justice Department for the audio of the interview, but those requests have been denied. DOJ provided the committees conducting the impeachment inquiry into Biden a full transcript of his interview and said Republicans haven't explained why the audio is necessary, accusing them of seeking investigative material to \"serve political purposes that should have no role in the treatment of law enforcement files.\"\n\nHouse Republicans grilled Hur for hours in a public hearing in March. Despite having access to the full transcript, the committee believes they need the audio because it may shed insight into Hur's assessment that Biden's age and lack of memory played a role in his decision to not press charges against the president.\n\nDuring his testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee, Hur testified that while he did not have an opinion on whether or not Congress should get access to the recordings, the audio specifically contributed to his decision not to press charges.\n\n\"It is not for me to weigh into what information Congress should or should not have,\" Hur said at the time, adding: \"The audio recordings were part of the evidence, of course, that I considered in coming to my conclusions.\"\n\nDOJ declined to comment on the potential markup of a resolution to hold Garland in contempt.\n\nIn a May 25 letter to the House committees conducting the Biden impeachment inquiry, Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte accused the committees of insufficiently explaining why the audio recording would be necessary.\n\n\"Despite our many requests, the Committees have not articulated a legitimate congressional need to obtain audio recordings from Mr. Hur's investigation, let alone one that outweighs the Department's strong interest in protecting the confidentiality of law enforcement files,\" he wrote. \"The Department will continue to cooperate reasonably and appropriately, but we will not risk the long-term integrity of our law enforcement work.\"\n\nThe Washington Examiner was the first to report the potential markup of a contempt resolution against Garland.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

A transcript of Hur's interview with Zwonitzer was also given.\n\nThe DOJ is \"concerned\" about the demands \"that is cumulative of information we already gave you\" and they indicate lawmakers want it for \"political purposes\" rather than \"legitimate oversight or investigatory functions,\" Uriarte said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nHur's report, which was released in February, criticized Biden's retention of classified records while out of office, yet the prosecutor declined to recommend charges.\n\nThe report described Biden as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\" whom a jury likely would not convict \"of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.\"\n\nHur also found that Zwonitzer deleted recordings of conversations he had with Biden upon learning about the documents inquiry.\n\nHowever, the ghostwriter provided \"plausible, innocent reasons\" for his actions during the interview and Hur said he ultimately determined the evidence would not suffice for a conviction on obstruction of justice.\n\nBiden and the White House have pushed back against Hur's characterizations in his report, but Garland insisted that it would have been \"absurd\" for someone in his position to have edited or censored the special counsel's explanation.\n\nDuring testimony to Congress in April, Garland acknowledged his agency sent correspondence \"explaining our position with respect to the recordings\" and noted the \"longstanding practice\" of keeping witness records confidential to not \"chill\" future investigations.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comer_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Comer (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

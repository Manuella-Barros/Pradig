join Rangers", "body": "Barron could soon be followed to Ibrox by another two new signings\n\nCONNOR BARRON told how Philippe Clement helped make the biggest decision of his life EASY.\n\nThe 21-year-old is facing a backlash from Dons fans after moving from Aberdeen to Rangers on a four-year deal.\n\nBut Barron insists he's ready for the next chapter of his career.\n\nThe new Rangers star confessed: \"It was a massive decision for me at this point in my career, but it was made easy by the staff here and speaking to the manager and straight away I knew this was the place I wanted to be.\n\n\"European football, that opportunity to go and play on the European stage at a big club like Rangers is something I feel I will thrive off and something I am looking forward to doing this season.\n\n\"Obviously the size of the club as well, it is where they demand high things and demand winning football matches and trophies and that is something that, for me, I want to be part of.\n\n\"I am absolutely delighted.\n\n\"Since it came on the go and we started chatting I knew straight away it was the place for me to come.\n\n\"Everything seemed right and I think it is the best place for me to be at this moment in my career.\n\n\"It is a good group of boys we have got here and a big fan base and a massive club.\n\n\"I think it will suit me down to the ground and I can't wait to get going and show everyone what I can do out here.\"\n\nSunSport revealed last week the Light Blues had ramped up their bid to sign Barron under freedom of contract.\n\nBologna, Hellas Verona, Plymouth, Stoke, Cardiff and Swansea were all chasing a deal, but it's Rangers who've landed the Scotland under-21 star from their fierce Premiership rivals.\n\nAberdeen would have been due around \u00a3525,000 in training compensation if the player had chosen to move outside Scotland.\n\nBut a switch to the Light Blues means both clubs will have to agree compensation or face a tribunal to determine the fee.\n\nBarron becomes Gers' fourth signing of the summer after the arrivals of Jefte, Oscar Cortes and Clinton Nsiala.\n\nAnd when asked what Clement's message was, the midfielder said: \"It was quite clear.\n\n\"He knew I wanted to come and he wanted me to come so straight away it was a perfect fit.\n\n\"We talked a lot about the way they want to play and the demands of Rangers Football Club and straight away it just felt right for me.\n\n\"I have played in Scotland, I know the league and what it is about.\n\n\"I think I can help that with the boys here.\n\n\"I am a leader on the pitch, I like to get on the ball and dictate games and I also like to do the dirty side of it as well.\"\n\nFollowing the capture of Barron, SunSport understands Moroccan striker Hamza Igamane and Bayern Munich winger Yusuf Kabadayi could be next.\n\nIt's understood 21-year-old Igamane has agreed terms on a four-year deal and he will make the move from AS Far Rabat early next week.\n\nKabadayi is set to join the band of new Rangers recruits.\n\nThe likes of Borna Barisic, Ryan Jack, John Lundstram and Kemar Roofe left the club at the end of last season.\n\nBoss Clement is in the middle of a massive rebuild - with growing uncertainty surrounding his skipper.\n\nJames Tavernier has been heavily linked with a move to Saudi Arabia and a reunion with ex-gaffer Steven Gerrard at Al-Ettifaq.\n\nTav - who has spent eight years at Ibrox - could be moved on along with Connor Goldson.\n\nIt's also understood the club are willing to listen to offers for midfielder Todd Cantwell.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andy_devlin@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Andy Devlin", "type": "author",

More info\n\nA deal to take Hamza Igamana to Rangers is expected to be completed in the next few days.\n\nThe Moroccan striker is edging closer to a \u00a31.5million switch from AS FAR Rabat as Philippe Clement's Ibrox rebuild ramps up. After Kemar Roofe's departure, Sam Lammers out in the cold and Cyriel Dessers yet to fully convince as a Gers no 9, the Belgian has identified Igamane as an ideal option to boost his firepower for an assault on the Premiership title this season.\n\nIgamane will become the Light Blues' fifth signing of the summer after Jefte, Oscar Cortes, Clinton Nsiala and former Aberdeen star Connor Barron were added to Clement's ranks. Barron has penned a four year deal with Rangers and revealed the clear message his new boss was keen to get over during signing talks after seeing first hand what the Scotland Under 21 international cold do against his side last term.\n\nHe said: \"It was quite clear. He knew I wanted to come and he wanted me to come so straight away it was a perfect fit. We talked a lot about the way they want to play and the demands of Rangers Football Club and straight away it just felt right for me.\n\n\"I spoke to some of the boys. It was nice to hear things from their side of it and some players who have played at the club as well and been involved in and around it. Everyone had good things to say. It was nice to get that from them as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_pilcher@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Ross Pilcher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "andrew_newport@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Andrew Newport", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_FAR_(football_club)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AS FAR (football club)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemar_Roofe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kemar Roofe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Clement", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Clement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrox_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ibrox Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Barron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor Barron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Lammers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Lammers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyriel_Dessers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyriel Dessers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aberdeen F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Clearing_Houses_and_Securities_Depositories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Clearing Houses and Securities Depositories", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Razors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Razors", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight_Edge", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight Edge", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33062173.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS336626809.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668694", "eventUri": "eng-9668694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

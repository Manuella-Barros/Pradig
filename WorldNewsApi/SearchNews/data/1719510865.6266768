{"id": 223702978, "title": "North Carolina Legislation Increasing Penalties for Masked Criminals Criticized as Targeting COVID-Era Precautions", "text": "A North Carolina bill to increase penalties for criminals who wear masks to conceal their identity while committing a crime is being scrutinized and framed as an attempt to target those who continue to follow COVID-era health precautions. Republican state Sen. Buck Newton told The Epoch Times that the bill\u2019s intent, however, is not to prohibit people from wearing masks if that is what they choose, but in response to growing law enforcement and business concerns over crime. \u201cMore and more people are using masks and other clothing to disguise themselves when engaging in criminal behavior,\u201d Mr. Newton said. \u201cIt seems logical to increase penalties for those who do so.\u201d \u201cThe law before COVID was pretty clear, and its main reason was to combat the Klu Klux Klan and other organizations who hide behind masks while attempting to intimidate people or do criminal acts,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we didn\u2019t see any reason why we needed to maintain this exception which really wasn\u2019t even necessary when it was passed for COVID.\u201d The exemption that was crossed out which has become the subject of controversy allows for \u201cany person wearing a mask for the purpose of ensuring the physical health or safety of the wearer or others.\u201d Essentially, the target of the bill are those who are trying to hide their identity, Sen. Newton said, so people who choose to wear a mask for COVID reasons, or because it\u2019s a part of their job, are free to continue to do so. Other exceptions include performing arts, Halloween, and Mardi Gras masks during holidays and other special occasions, he said. She said she agreed with Republicans on needing legislation to make the jobs of law enforcement easier, but at the same time, the immunocompromised must stay protected. \u201cSome people say that we\u2019re fear-mongering,\u201d Sen. Batch said. \u201cAnd what I would tell you is that for someone who\u2019s been immunocompromised in the past and had to wear masks, and my children and my husband wear masks to protect me, you know, I\u2019m not fear-mongering. It\u2019s a genuine concern, right? Somebody can actually die and get very ill if they are not able to protect themselves, if they\u2019re immunocompromised, etc.\u201d She went on to say that, if passed, the legislation would disproportionately impact the black community. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can recall ever seeing a picture of a person who is supposed to be a part of Antifa who wasn\u2019t masked,\u201d Mr. Newton said. \u201cWhether they are the Klan or Antifa, we want them unmasked. Law enforcement wants them unmasked. And I think the general public would like them unmasked.\u201d Additional penalties found in the bill \u201ccreate civil liability\u201d for protesters who block roads for emergency vehicles. \u201cThe title is plain enough, straight to the point, and completely accurate,\u201d Mr. Fontenot said. \u201cThe law is reasonable and should be enacted immediately. I write about this because a lot of lies and malicious misinformation has been spread concerning this law. Personally, I\u2019m upset because the slander that has been spread is dangerous and completely unfounded in reality.\u201d He said that criminals are the ones who are propagating lies that the legislation is targeting those who want to wear masks for reasons other than committing a crime, such as perceived health maintenance. \u201cThis law ONLY applies to people wearing masks while committing crimes, no more and no less,\u201d Mr. Fontenot said. The reaction to the bill is unfortunate, Mr. Newton said. \u201cI find it regrettable that so many people have been frightened into thinking that their mask-wearing for health reasons is somehow going to be criminalized,\u201d he said.", "summary": "A North Carolina bill to increase penalties for criminals who wear masks to conceal their identity while committing a crime is being scrutinized and framed as an attempt to target those who continue to follow COVID-era health precautions.

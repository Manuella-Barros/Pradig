{"id": 243349270, "title": "El Fuerte, Marbella: chic, old-world glamour offering a classier side to the Costa del Sol", "text": "Nine-course tasting breakfasts and Michelin-starred chefs. Chic low-lit libraries straight out of an interiors catalogue. A guest book featuring everyone from Walt Disney to Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. These are just some of the highlights of a stay at El Fuerte, a 66-year-old iconic seaside hotel right on Marbella\u2019s beachfront \u2014 and the latest in a string of chic new properties helping to redefine the Golden Mile\u2019s Brits-abroad stereotype thanks to a five-star, \u00a330 million makeover. No package holidays here. Instead, think \u00a3350 helicopter rides, glamorous old world lounge areas and private terraces with hot tubs featuring the best views in town. From the couples massages at the Clarins spa to the hotel\u2019s own beach bar Soleo, here\u2019s what to expect. Right behind the promenade in the heart of Marbella, just 30 seconds from the beach. The old town and its labyrinth of charming cobbled streets is just a five-minute walk away. Terracotta hues and cool ceramics. Emerald green tiles and brushed brass features. Bold marble bathrooms and bright modern libraries. It\u2019s not your classic Marbs beach break. But that\u2019s exactly the point. The vibe at El Fuerte is Mediterranean chic but with plenty of the old world glamour of its 1950s, Audrey Hepburn-era roots. The landmark property dates back to 1957 but completed a whopping 15-month, \u00a326.5 million renovation last year (Roman, Phoenician and Islamic artefacts were unearthed during excavations to construct the spa) thanks to award-winning Chilean designer Jaime Beriestain \u2014 and the result is contemporary yet elegant with an Andalusian twist. Think cool Spanish tiling, floor to ceiling plants and bold modern art lining the corridors. Staff will bring a coral-coloured beach towel to your lounger and umbrellas come in an elegant white and burgundy stripe. Each of El Fuerte\u2019s 266 rooms features the hotel\u2019s signature colour scheme, cool contemporary lighting and all the essentials from a coffee maker and complimentary beauty products to minibar featuring drinks, snacks and recyclable El Fuerte water bottles. Expect quilt bedding, Nordic-style duvets and a pillow menu in the bedroom. All rooms come with walk-in showers and outdoor terraces and most come with view out over the Mediterranean, with sexy, characterful details such as little marble dining tables for pre-dinner sundowners and \u2014 if you\u2019re lucky \u2014 sleek outdoor hot tubs overlooking the sea. Choose a double room with a lounge and a freestanding bathtub beneath the TV if you\u2019re after some extra space. La Dama Master Suite is one of 78 top-tier rooms with daily spa access and arguably the best room in the hotel, with a full-facing sea view, large dining table and 29 square-metre terrace featuring a private alfresco hot tub. Pets are allowed on request. There are three restaurants to choose from: Middle Eastern fine-dining inspired by an Arab souk at Le March\u00e9; trendy, Mediterranean inspired cuisine at Levante; and locally-sourced fine-dining at Edge, glass-wrapped rooftop restaurant from Michelin-starred chef Paco P\u00e9rez with 360-degree views over the sea and old town. The hotel also boasts its own laid-back beach club, Soleo, serving Tommy\u2019s margaritas, beef tartare starters and giant Caesar salads in sleek wooden bowls bigger than your head. Breakfast, too, is a three-option affair, with the choice of a buffet (highlights include crepes made to order, handmade pastries and the best selection of gluten and lactose-free dishes I\u2019ve seen at a hotel breakfast), a la carte menu (highlights include a lobster roll chia, mushroom fritters and Malaga sausage tartar) and even a nine-course tasting menu, featuring everything from oysters and waffle benedictine to sweet potato omlette and local cheeses \u2014 the most decadent hotel breakfast I\u2019ve come across. Ensure you leave time to make an occasion of it, though be wary of feasting if you plan to do anything other than lounge by the pool all day. There are two glistening swimming pools surrounded by palms and sun-loungers, multiple sun terraces with views of the ocean, and plenty of comfy hangout spaces including a chic downstairs library and a rooftop serving cocktails that turns into Edge restaurant at night. You won\u2019t find a better view in town. There\u2019s also a sixth-floor gym with smart Technogym kit, but the hotel\u2019s Spa by Clarins is, in most guests\u2019 opinion, the real highlight, with an extensive treatments list plus a hydrotherapy circuit featuring everything from a dynamic pool with jets to a steam room and ice fountain. Treatments range from couples massages, detox facials and lymphatic drainage massages designed to eliminate toxins. There\u2019s also an energising facial specifically designed for men\u2019s skin. The hotel also offers a wide variety of experiences, from private dining and cooking classes to helicopter rides and excursions to Tangier, Seville and the Alhambra. Just ask the smartly-dressed staff reception for details. The view from the rooftop, palm trees swaying in the breeze and El Fuerte\u2019s signature white and burgundy paraols framing the pool below. Well-to-do couples looking for a (chic) beach break just three hours from London. English, Irish, Dutch and American guests are common here, and you\u2019ll hear many Spanish-speaking voices at breakfast too. Flights from London to M\u00e1laga are just under three hours, then it\u2019s a 40-minute cab at the other end.

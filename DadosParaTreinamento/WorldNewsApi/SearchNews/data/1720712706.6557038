Whilst she now owns just one private jet, at one point the award-winning singer did own two giving her the choice of which to board as she flies around the world. She currently owns a Dassault 7X model, but did also own a Dassault Falcon 900 which she sold on January 30 of this year. The Dassault Falcon 900 had a list price of $44million (\u00a338m) when new, with Taylor's version boasting a kitchen, a bathroom with a shower and a bedroom.

Taylor's love of a private jet saw her board one 170 times last year, particularly as she flew back and forth to watch boyfriend Travis Kelce play his football games with his team the Kansas City Chiefs. However Taylor has previously been slammed for using private jets in the past after she topped a list of celebrities with the most private jet carbon emissions in 2022. It was also reported in 2023 that her private jets had spent over 166 hours in flight during the initial run of dates on her Eras Tour. A spokesperson for Taylor told The Mirror that she purchased carbon credits to offset the usage of her jets. Taylor has tried to limit the information available about her flights in the past by, using the FAA's privacy ICAO aircraft address program, also known as PIA. How to buy Taylor Swift Eras Tour tickets Taylor Swift fans looking at resale tickets for the upcoming Eras Tour in the UK can purchase them from a number of online retailers right now. Sites such as viagogo and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs. Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double-check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure a smooth live event experience. Tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand. As a result, fans are buying at their own risk. With that said, viagogo also commented: \u201cviagogo is a regulated marketplace where fans have the freedom to buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events, safely and securely, backed by a guarantee.\u201d Although the above sellers, including viagogo and Vivid Seats, are not \"official\" retailers, they do have a number of strict terms and conditions in place to keep ticket buyers and ticket sellers safe. *Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "summary": "Taylor Swift has previously owned not one but two private luxury jets, with the star previously criticised for her private jet carbon emissions and the impact on the environment", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/inside-taylor-swifts-luxury-private-32992926", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32993018.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Inside-Taylor-Swifts-private-jet.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:33:34", "author": "Niamh Spence,Niamh-Spence", "authors": ["Niamh Spence", "Niamh-Spence"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.364}

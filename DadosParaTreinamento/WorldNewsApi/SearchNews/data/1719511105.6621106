{"id": 223734316, "title": "Liverpool's stance crystal clear after Barcelona hold Luis Diaz transfer meeting", "text": "Barcelona are reportedly ready to try and prise Luis Diaz away from Liverpool this summer after holding talks with his agent. Diaz has 24 goals and 13 assists in 98 appearances since joining the club for an initial \u00a337million from Porto in January 2022. The Colombia international has become a key player for the Reds on the wing, but with Jurgen Klopp leaving to be replaced by Arne Slot, it seems he has become unsettled. Rumours of a summer move to Barcelona first surfaced in March and a report from AS says they are pushing ahead with their plans to sign him. Barca sporting director Deco held talks with Diaz's representatives Carlos Van-Strahalen and Raul Pais Da Costa two months back and they have received some positive feedback. Liverpool are in a strong negotiating position, with Diaz contracted at Anfield until the summer of 2027 and the club don\u2019t want to lose him. Having previously been quoted between \u20ac120million (\u00a3102m) and \u20ac140m (\u00a3120m) \u2013 a fee that president Joan Laporta said was \u201cunfeasible\", Barcelona are prepared for \u2018tough negotiations\u2019 with the Reds and are so keen on Diaz that they would be willing to sell Raphinha to accommodate him.

Having recently sacked Xavi Hernandez, they are set to appoint former Germany boss Hansi Flick and are preparing to revamp the squad to start a new era after finishing well behind Real Madrid in La Liga. Their positive feeling on signing Diaz stems partly from the words of his father, Luis Manuel Diaz, who admitted recently that it would be a dream for the forward to join Barcelona. \"There was never anything serious with Real Madrid or Atl\u00e9tico [in 2022],\" he told Cadena Ser in March. \"Liverpool were always more determined and concrete to sign Luis. We haven\u2019t lost our hope yet\u2026Luis is playing well and Spanish clubs are always active in the market.\" Diaz had a mixed season at Liverpool, returning 13 goals and five assists in 51 games as Klopp\u2019s side fell short in the Premier League, finishing third but winning the Carabao Cup. Speaking after the end of the campaign, he suggested he is happy and willing to stay and play under Slot. \"It\u2019s no secret, we didn\u2019t finish as well as we hoped. For us, it was crucial to win the league and all the competitions we were in. Unfortunately, the results lately could not be achieved,\" Diaz told the club website. \"We fell [behind] as a team, but we made a decent season, both individually and as a group. There are many things to improve so we can have a perfect season. But I\u2019m happy and content to be here.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

{"id": 231437514, "title": "Ian Rankin: My readers are more worried about Rebus\u2019s health than mine", "text": "The Scottish writer, 64, appeared at Saturday\u2019s Queen\u2019s Reading Room Festival at Hampton Court Palace in Surrey, alongside other crime authors including Lee Child and Ann Cleeves, as part of a panel about their genre of fiction. Sir Ian talked about when he goes to John Rebus\u2019s favourite pub, the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, and is met with people \u201calways slighted disappointed that the guy they see is not\u201d the \u201ccomplex, dark and dangerous, brooding\u201d fictional detective. He described himself as a \u201cguy sitting in a corner with a pint of beer and a crossword\u201d and \u201ca safe\u201d person instead of the complex hero. Sir Ian added: \u201cThey\u2019re much more worried about Rebus\u2019s health than my health. \u201cAs long as the books keep coming, they don\u2019t care. I could have a terrible cold or I could be on the point of death.\u201d He said that when Rebus developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) after years of smoking, fans asked if the detective would be \u201cOK\u201d living with the condition, and \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about the author\u2019s ailments. He said he had thought the end of his latest book, A Heart Full Of Headstones, which sees Rebus waiting in prison for a trial, would be a \u201cterrific ending to the series\u201d, but fans \u201cbullied\u201d him into writing another book, as they needed to know what happens next. The latest book, Midnight And Blue, is to be released later this year, with the author accidentally giving spoilers at the event, and pointing to what appeared to be Rebus\u2019s relationship with pathologist Deborah Quant. Sir Ian said: \u201cThere was a kind of friends with benefits thing going on recently with a pathologist. But now he\u2019s in chokey (prison), that\u2019s not so easy. \u201cAnd since she gave evidence against him at his trial\u2026 you don\u2019t find this out until the next book which is published in October, so forget I said that.\u201d He also said he has not yet watched the latest BBC instalment of the 2024 series of Rebus, which is on BBC iPlayer, as he watches \u201cin real time\u201d. \u201cSo I\u2019ll be in my hotel room in London tonight at (9.15pm) with my wife because we haven\u2019t seen it, so we\u2019ll watch episode four tonight,\u201d he added before joking: \u201cAnd I just hope that the screenwriter has toned down the swearing, he\u2019s got a very potty mouth.\u201d Elsewhere, Child spoke about how indebted he is to his female readers, who make up an estimated 65% of buyers of his Jack Reacher books. He told the audience: \u201cI think you go into it imagining that women readers are going to want something more soft and human but the reverse is absolutely true and it\u2019s an age thing as well\u2026 the most fearsome readers are older ladies. I call them the killer grannies. \u201cThey absolutely love the mayhem and the blood and the broken bones and all of that, which took me by surprise, really\u2026 Reacher\u2026 wouldn\u2019t think of himself as specifically a feminist, but he would regard himself as a rational human being. \u201cAnd that makes you a feminist, in my opinion, that if you look at the world, like it really is, you see people as completely equal until proven otherwise.\u201d Child, whose real name is Jim Grant, said his series is post-feminism as it does not matter if the bad guy is male or female because the lead character, a former US army officer, \u201cwill break their neck\u201d. \u201cMale readers are so frustrating because there\u2019s a huge demographic of men that are, first of all, rich enough to afford to buy books, and secondly, literate enough to read them,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they have a terrible bias against fiction. \u201cThey prefer to read about some president who died 200 years ago and so getting through to those people is difficult.\u201d The Coventry-born writer also said he sets his books in America as he can take advantage of scale of the country, such as in Die Trying, which sees Reacher \u201cthrown into a van and driven 1,500 miles to a remote mountain hideout\u201d while still being in the US. He added: \u201cWhat really attracted me to writing about America was, as I say, the audience, they\u2019re very into crime fiction, they\u2019re into thrillers, they will take a chance. \u201cAnd Britain is much more reserved about taking the chance on new things I find.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Author Sir Ian Rankin has said fans of his Rebus series are more concerned about the health of the book\u2019s detective than his own.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/ian-rankin-my-readers-are-more-worried-about-rebuss-health-than-mine/a1454900763.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/v6rdrkeY9w9dR9NN7UY7s1XDXI4=/0x330:3270x2510/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/b98896aa-f73b-4d4d-a017-94c6df645014/5fdb93c5-df29-4ca7-aeec-b4bcf8ac084f/2.75721577.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:20:08", "author": "Charlotte McLaughlin, Pa Senior Entertainment Reporter", "authors": ["Charlotte McLaughlin, Pa Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.071}

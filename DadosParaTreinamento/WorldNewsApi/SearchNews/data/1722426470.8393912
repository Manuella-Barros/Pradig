By the time Riley\u2019s Anxiety-shaped sense of self is complete, it is riddled with self-doubt. Joy manages to restore Riley\u2019s original sense of self to headquarters, yet even that fails to quell the paralyzing whirlwind of angst that has taken over her mind. Only when Joy steps back and allows a more complicated self-image to flower from a broader pool of memories\u2014with beliefs such as \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d and \u201cI make mistakes\u201d intermingling with those such as \u201cI\u2019m kind\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a good friend\u201d\u2014does Riley\u2019s anxiety subside. The (subtly Christian) message seems to be that part of growing up is reckoning with our own brokenness. Shame, too, has its purpose.", "summary": "Pixar\u2019s sequel captures teen anxiety, not what American teenhood is like today.", "url": "https://thedispatch.com/article/where-are-the-phones-in-inside-out-2/", "image": "https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/inside-out-2.jpeg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:45:00", "author": "Stephanie H.

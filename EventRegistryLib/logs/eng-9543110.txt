You can see photos of Riley Greene, Tarik Skubal, and Spencer Torkelson modeling the jerseys and hats.\n\nWhen will Tigers wear these?\n\nThe Tigers will debut these uniforms at home on May 10 against the Houston Astros. They will wear them for the rest of their Friday home games this season.\n\nDetroit is one of nine teams to unveil City Connect uniforms this season. The goal of the jerseys is to celebrate the history, culture, and spirit of each city.\n\n\"We are excited to introduce the Tigers City Connect uniforms and celebrate the past, present, and future of the Motor City,\" said Ryan Gustafson, president and CEO of Ilitch Sports and Entertainment.\n\nGustafson said the uniforms represent Detroit's combination of muscle and innovation, paying homage to the \"city that put the world on wheels.\"\n\n\"From the tire treads to the VIN tag to the M-1 patch on the sleeve, there are unique features on the uniforms, caps, and batting helmets we feel Tigers fans and Detroiters will appreciate,\" Gustafson said.\n\nWhat elements symbolize\n\nThe electric blue tire treads down the middle of the jersey represent \"the wheels keeping the Motor City and the Tigers accelerating toward the future,\" the release said.\n\nThe uniforms celebrate M-1, saying Woodward Avenue \"unites neighborhoods, and is a central heartbeat of the city's pride, progress, and potential.\" It also notes that Comerica Park is on Woodward Avenue.\n\n\"The 313 patch stitched on the left sleeve of the jersey takes you on a ride to M-1, known to Detroiters as Woodward Avenue, America's first paved road in 1909,\" the release says. \"The baseball diamond-shaped patch features Detroit's '313' area code, with the No. 1 bolded and emphasized to emulate the classic M-1 road signs.\"\n\nThe racing stripes at the bottom of each sleeve celebrate that Detroit has long been at the core of the racing industry and \"parallels the Tigers' youthful speed and energy.\"\n\nLike every vehicle, the uniform also has its own unique VIN: 190135456884. It represents the team's first year of AL membership (1901), and the years of all four World Series championships: 1935, 1945, 1968, and 1984.\n\nThe tiger eyes at the belt line of the jersey and under the bill of the cap symbolize the \"passion, energy, and tenacity\" of the Tigers and Detroiters.\n\nThe Tigers will have an electric blue City Connect batting helmet with a similar design as the jersey. \"Detroit\" is scripted across the front and includes the VIN tag on the right side, with a matte finish.\n\nIlitch comments\n\nHere's what the Ilitch Sports release said about the uniforms:\n\nThe Tigers City Connect uniforms are an ode to the Motor City, a moniker bestowed upon Detroit in the early 1900s when it became the epicenter of the automotive industry, putting the world on wheels, and driving a significant part of Michigan's economy. It defines who we are as Detroiters, our unwavering drive, steadfast resiliency, and indomitable spirit. The Motor City represents the pride of its hard-working people and is proudly displayed across the chest of the City Connect jersey.\n\nAlong with paying tribute to the remarkable history of the automotive industry in Detroit, the Tigers City Connect uniforms were created with the momentum of the city and its bright future in mind. The innovative and modern design presents a fashionable electric blue and dark navy-blue color combination with several features that will resonate with Detroiters, Michiganders, and Tigers fans everywhere.\n\nLike Detroit and the auto industry, the Tigers hold fast to a storied history of both challenge and triumph. While paying homage to our past, we enthusiastically turn the page toward a future brimming with opportunity. It's a revitalization in parallel - the resurgence of Detroit, the innovation within the auto industry and the transformation of the Tigers ball club -- all converging at a pivotal moment and better than before. The Tigers City Connect illustrates the foresight to shift into a new era of excellence as we drive our forward-thinking, building something special through technology, youthful energy, and optimism.\n\nStanding side-by-side with the people of Detroit and the auto industry, it's the numbers that prove our Motor City story. Where Michigan is #1 in the nation for automotive manufacturing jobs (6X higher than the national average); accounting for 1.1 million automotive or mobility jobs representing 20% of the state's workforce; and 21% of all U.S. auto production. Source: Detroit Regional Chamber.\n\nWe are Detroit, where innovation meets grit, where excellence meets work, where challenge meets resilience. We look forward through the windshield and no longer in the rear-view mirror. It's us against everyone. We are Detroit, where muscle meets brains. We are the Motor City.\n\nIlitch Sports and Entertainment\n\nCity Connect block parties\n\nThe Tigers and Nike are hosting two City Connect-themed block parties outside Comerica Park.\n\nThe first will be from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. May 10.

After that, the Tigers will wear the City Connects for every Friday home game throughout the remainder of the 2024 schedule.\n\nThe black and blue outfits pay tribute to the automotive industry through a variety of design elements, the most notable of which is the \"Motor City\" emblazoned across the front of the jersey in white letters across the chest of the jersey, which blends a combination of \"pitch blue\" and \"hyper royal\" colors.\n\nACROSS THE STREET: Detroit Lions reveal new uniforms at Ford Field for 2024 season\n\nThe new uniforms feature four more standout design elements.\n\nThe middle of the jersey, behind the \"Motor City\" typography, features tire treads shaded in an \"electric blue\" color, representing the wheels of a vehicle keeping Detroit's auto industry and the Tigers together by \"accelerating toward the future.\"\n\nOne sleeve of the jersey features a diamond-shaped patch with a \"1\" on it, reminiscent of the M-1 road sign that designates Woodward Avenue -- the first paved road in America, dating back to 1909. The sleeve patch includes the 313 area code, another nod to downtown Detroit, with the \"1\" bolded to emulate the M-1 road sign.\n\nBoth sleeves have a design at the ends with blue and black stripes, similar to the details on muscle cars, paying respect to the racing industry.\n\nAdding to the jersey-as-car motif, each jersey has a number in the style of a Vehicle Identification Number attached to new cars. For the Tigers, their City Connect \"VIN\" -- 190135456884 -- has a very specific meaning, made up of five components: First, there's the Tigers' inaugural membership in the American League, dating to 1901. Then there are two digits for each of the four World Series championships in franchise history: 1935, 1945, 1968 and 1984.\n\nThe inside brim of the cap features an \"electric blue\" version of the Tigers logo used on the spring training hats earlier this year, while the front of the cap departs from the traditional Old English \"D.\" Instead, the crown of the hat has the word \"Detroit\" in the same typography as \"Motor City\" from the jersey. The hat also repeats the Tigers' 190135456884 \"VIN\" on the right side, as does the Tigers' batting helmet. The batting helmet looks like the hat.\n\n\"We are excited to introduce the Tigers City Connect uniforms and celebrate the past, present, and future of the Motor City,\" said Ryan Gustafson, president and CEO of Ilitch Sports + Entertainment. \"The City Connect uniforms represent Detroit's unique combination of muscle and innovation and pay homage to the city that put the world on wheels.

Above all, the uniforms are symbolic of the revitalization and the exciting future ahead for the Tigers and our great city.\"\n\nTo celebrate the City Connect launch, the Tigers and Nike will host two free \"block parties\" -- presented by Meijer -- outside Comerica Park.

In addition, racing stripes are located at the bottom of each sleeve and on the pants as a \"a nod to Detroit's central role in the racing industry and parallels youthful speed and energy.\"\n\nThe automotive industry is also highlighted by a fake vehicle identification number that is located on the hat and uniform itself.\n\nThere is a diamond-shaped patch that includes the number \"313\" that is stitched on the sleeve of the jersey. 313 is the area code for the city of Detroit.\n\nThe \"1\" stands out in the 313 area code on the sleeve as a tribute to the M-1, which is a Michigan highway known to local presidents as Woodward Avenue. It was the first paved road in the United States and runs 27 miles from southern Detroit to nearby Pontiac.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_bengel@cbssports.com", "name": "Chris Bengel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle identification number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-1_(Michigan_highway)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M-1 (Michigan highway)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pontiac, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pontiac, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trucking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/06/fa435d17-6e6f-46be-9e16-141d9b5cd0a3/thumbnail/1200x675/e1eee98a8df79d6bd1a6e40605cfc65e/tigers-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543110", "eventUri": "eng-9543110", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

The hat and jersey are designed to show a cultural link to the club's home city.\n\nThe Tigers will wear the new uniforms on Friday and Saturday against the Houston Astros. (May 12 is Mother's Day, so they'll go back to the traditional uniforms to better fit with MLB's special Mother's Day-themed apparel).\n\nThereafter, the Tigers plan to wear the uniforms for every Friday home game this season.\n\nThe Tigers will host free block parties to celebrate the City Connect launch on Friday from 4-7 p.m. and Saturday from 12-6:30 p.m. No game ticket is required to attend the block parties, which will feature live music, local food trucks, classic cars, kids stuff and, of course, plenty of City Connect merchandise for sale.\n\nThe uniform is infused with design elements that celebrate the Motor City theme.\n\nThe base of the uniform is a very dark navy blue with electric blue tire treads shading the middle of the jersey.\n\nThe left sleeve patch mimics the M-1 highway sign, an homage to Woodward Avenue. Viewed from a different angle or light, the number \"3'' is seen on either side of the M-1 sign for Detroit's 313 area code.\n\nThe dark-navy caps are adorned with DETROIT in large letters.\n\nThe inside of each jersey and the side of the caps will have a \"VIN\" number of 190135456884.\n\nTigers' fans can probably guess the significance: The year of the club's founding in 1901, followed by World Series championships in 1935, 1945, 1968 and 1984.\n\nThe Tigers are one of the final teams to get a City Connect jersey. Only two of MLB's 30 teams have declined to participate: The New York Yankees, for historical reasons; and the Oakland Athletics, because they are about to move out of Oakland.\n\nThe Tigers City Connect uniforms are an ode to the Motor City, a moniker bestowed upon Detroit in the early 1900s when it became the epicenter of the automotive industry, putting the world on wheels, and driving a significant part of Michigan's economy. It defines who we are as Detroiters, our unwavering drive, steadfast resiliency, and indomitable spirit. The Motor City represents the pride of its hard-working people and is proudly displayed across the chest of the City Connect jersey.\n\nAlong with paying tribute to the remarkable history of the automotive industry in Detroit, the Tigers City Connect uniforms were created with the momentum of the city and its bright future in mind.\n\nThe innovative and modern design presents a fashionable electric blue and dark navy-blue color combination with several features that will resonate with Detroiters, Michiganders, and Tigers fans everywhere.\n\nLike Detroit and the auto industry, the Tigers hold fast to a storied history of both challenge and triumph. While paying homage to our past, we enthusiastically turn the page toward a future brimming with opportunity. It's a revitalization in parallel - the resurgence of Detroit, the innovation within the auto industry and the transformation of the Tigers ballclub - all converging at a pivotal moment and better than before. The Tigers City Connect illustrates the foresight to shift into a new era of excellence as we drive our forward-thinking, building something special through technology, youthful energy, and optimism.\n\nStanding side by side with the people of Detroit and the auto industry, it's the numbers that prove our Motor City story. Where Michigan is #1 in the nation for automotive manufacturing jobs (6X higher than the national average); accounting for 1.1 million automotive or mobility jobs representing 20% of the state's workforce; and 21% of all U.S. auto production.

Above all, the uniforms are symbolic of the revitalization and exciting future ahead for the Tigers and our great city.\"\n\nThe uniforms feature multiple shades of blue, with an all-caps \"MOTOR CITY\" across the front of the jerseys. In what the ballclub is referring to as electric blue, there are tire tracks running down the entire front of the jersey. There also are electric-blue racing stripes on the sleeves, and down the length of the pants. On one of the sleeves, there is a tribute to the famous Woodward Avenue street sign, a diamond with a No. 1 in the middle. The No. 1 is flanked by 3's on both sides, in a reflective, silverish shade, making for a 3-1-3. In the Woodward Avenue diamond, there's a small Olde English D on top, the only Olde English D visible on Detroit's City Connect uniforms.\n\nThe caps and batting helmets are navy blue, with an all-caps \"DETROIT\" across the front, and then a VIN number on the side. The VIN number is 190135456884, a tip of the cap to the team's founding in 1901, and its fourth world championships, in 1935, 1945, 1968 and 1984. The VIN number also appears on the back collar of the jersey.\n\nThere are two nods to the Tigers on the jerseys, with Tigers eyes near the beltline and underneath the bill of the cap.\n\nPlayer numbers on the back of the jerseys are in italics, just like \"DETROIT\" on the caps and \"MOTOR CITY\" on the front of the jerseys. That symbolizes motion, and the future.\n\n\"We are Detroit, where innovation meets grit, where excellence meets work, where challenge meets resilience,\" the Tigers said in a press release Monday, under an \"Our Story\" header explaining the genesis of the City Connect uniforms. \"We look forward through the windshield and no longer in the rear-view mirror.\n\n\"It's us against everyone. We are Detroit, where muscle meets brains. We are the Motor City.\"\n\nMajor League Baseball, Nike and the league's teams have been rolling out the City Connect jerseys since 2021, and Tigers brass, from the marketing department all the way up to ownership, have been working on theirs for more than two years. MLB is rolling out nine MLB City Connect uniforms this season.\n\nWearing the City Connect uniforms will signal a break from a long-running tradition for the Tigers, who've almost exclusively worn white uniforms for their home games -- even when they annually wear Detroit Stars and Fiesta Tigres tribute uniforms.\n\nThe City Connect line of merchandise was set to go on sale at Comerica Park's D Shop at 10 a.m. Monday, and online at mlbshop.com.\n\nThe Tigers will celebrate the uniform launch with two free block parties this week, outside Comerica Park on Friday from 4-7 p.m. and Saturday from noon-6:30 p.m. The parties will feature live music, local food trucks, muralists, merchandise tents, a classic car show and giveaways.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Connect", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "City Connect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comerica_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comerica Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-1_(Michigan_highway)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M-1 (Michigan highway)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_manifold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhaust manifold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiesta_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiesta Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comerica", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comerica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windshield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windshield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classic car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Uniforms", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Uniforms", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/06/PDTN/73584851007-041124-amf-8182-enhanced-nr.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543110", "eventUri": "eng-9543110", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Over a century later, the \"Motor City\" moniker remains strong -- and the Detroit Tigers are changing gears to tap in to that nickname with a new look.\n\nThe Tigers revealed their City Connect uniform on Monday, tapping into the \"exciting future\" of the franchise and city, while honoring Detroit's rich automotive history.\n\nThe uniforms will debut Friday and Saturday against the Houston Astros and will be worn during every home Friday game throughout the season.\n\n\"The City Connect uniforms represent Detroit's unique combination of muscle and innovation and pay homage to the city that put the world on wheels,\" Tigers president and CEO Ryan Gustafson said in a news release. \"The uniforms are symbolic of the revitalization and exciting future ahead for the Tigers and our great city.\"\n\nIt's a design that focuses on an \"era of excellence\" as the Tigers drive their \"forward thinking, building something special through technology, youthful energy and optimism.\"\n\nThere are multiple elements of the electric blue and dark navy blue uniform that do exactly that. \"Motor City\" appears across the chest of the uniform for the first time in franchise history. Tiger eyes are on the beltline of the right side of the uniform and underneath the brim of the cap.\n\nThe \"beautiful\" shade of the jersey's electric blue is also no accident, Katie Jackson, Tigers vice president of marketing, told ESPN. Detroit, and Michigan as a whole, is at the forefront of an electric vehicle renaissance, coinciding with the Tigers' revitalization.\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has set a goal for 2 million electric vehicles in the state by 2030, emphasizing accessibility.\n\n\"Electric blue, I mean, it truly is the innovation of what's happening here in Detroit across the auto industry, the city itself and the team,\" Jackson said.\n\nThe Tigers are also optimistic about their future, although their last playoff appearance came in 2014. Detroit has selected in the top five picks of the MLB draft in five of the past six years, including No. 1 overall picks Casey Mize in 2018 and Spencer Torkelson in 2020.\n\nThe aforementioned shade is featured on tire treads that run down the middle of the jersey and provide a pop of color. Racing stripes are included at the bottom of each sleeve and down the pants, \"a nod to Detroit's central role in the racing industry and parallels youthful speed and energy.\"\n\nOne of the more unique elements of the design is a faux \"vehicle identification number\" that appears on the cap and uniform -- 190135456884.\n\nThe \"1901\" represents the Tigers' inaugural season as founding members of the American League. Season-ticket members identify themselves as \"1901 society members.\" The rest of the numbers -- 35, 45, 68 and 84 -- are the years Detroit won the World Series\n\n\"Because we're immersed in it every day, being in Detroit, like auto is just so top of mind ... so when thinking through what is a unique element that is distinctly auto, I mean, that is truly unique, right?\" Jackson said. \"There is a [VIN] for your car and that doesn't exist anywhere else, and so that concept was a bit of, like, that 'aha' moment of, like, how do we make this really unique to us?\"\n\nA baseball-diamond-shaped patch with the numerals 313 is stitched on the side of the sleeve. It represents the Detroit area code with the 3s more reflective and the 1 in bold.\n\nThe 1 stands out to represent the M-1, a Michigan highway more commonly known to Detroiters as Woodward Avenue. In 1909, it became the first paved road in America and runs 27 miles from south Detroit to north Pontiac. The home of the Tigers, Comerica Park, is located at 2100 Woodward Avenue.\n\n\"That [sleeve patch] worked out so nicely to be able to really give a nod to both of those things that are so special to people who are from here,\" Jackson said.\n\nThe electric blue going down the uniform stood out immediately to players. They reacted with amazement to the design, especially when seeing the specific elements.\n\n\"They really saw every element of it was so thoughtful and was really beautiful and something that they were super excited and proud to be wearing and certainly going to be proud on Friday to wear it as part of the debut,\" Jackson said.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Torkelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Torkelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Mize", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casey Mize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle identification number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comerica_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comerica Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-1_(Michigan_highway)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M-1 (Michigan highway)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pontiac, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pontiac, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0505%2Fr1329036_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543110", "eventUri": "eng-9543110", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The Black jerseys have \"MOTOR CITY\" written across the chest in white, while their are blue marks resembling tire treads behind the lettering. There are other nods, such as a \"1\" patch on a sleeve as a nod to the M-1 road sign signaling Woodward Ave., racing stripes and a Vehicle Identification Number like the ones attached to new cars.\n\nREAD ALL ABOUT THE NEW UNIS HERE: Detroit Tigers' City Connect uniforms hit the street with plenty of automotive connections\n\nThe City Connect uniforms will be worn on Fridays throughout the season following the debut weekend.\n\nTigers fans online are split with the new look.

This year, many teams have added new, unique uniforms to their collection, and Detroit followed suit. However, fans aren't exactly thrilled with the product.\n\nIn the comments of the Instagram post where these jerseys were revealed, fans went in on the design of them. Some even mentioned that all City Connect jerseys have been underwhelming.\n\nThe Tigers' new uniforms drew comparisons to soccer jerseys or Formula One outfits. Some fans liked the jersey itself as well as the pants, but they aren't pleased with the addition of the hat.\n\nMany were quick to point out that they feel similar to a lot of other City Connect jerseys. For example, the Philadelphia Phillies just introduced and debuted their uniforms, which are also black and blue like Detroit's.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays, Seattle Mariners, and Chicago Cubs also feature very similar color schemes. Additionally, the vast majority of City Connect uniforms feature black as a predominant color, so doing the black and blue theme for the Tigers didn't sit well with fans.\n\nNot everyone disliked them, though. As mentioned, some fans liked it down to the hat, and others said they enjoyed the design and the story behind it.\n\nDetroit Tigers trying to bounce back from sweep\n\nDespite Tarik Skubal's best efforts, which included 12 strikeouts over six innings, the Detroit Tigers fell on Sunday to the New York Yankees. That left the Tigers flying out of New York without a single win.\n\nEntering with a 18-13 record, they had a prime opportunity to make up ground in the AL Central. Instead, Aaron Judge and Juan Soto helped bury them over three games and pushed them further down.\n\nNow, the Tigers head to Cleveland to take on the Guardians. The Guardians lead the AL Central at 22-12, so it's another great opportunity to make up ground and get back to their winning ways.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Connect", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "City Connect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarik_Skubal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarik Skubal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Uniforms", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Uniforms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/f047d-17150067052775-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543110", "eventUri": "eng-9543110", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

In what the ballclub is referring to as electric blue, there are tire tracks running down the entire front of the jersey. There also are electric-blue racing stripes on the sleeves, and down the length of the pants. On one of the sleeves, there is a tribute to the famous Woodward Avenue street sign, a diamond with a No. 1 in the middle. The No. 1 is flanked by 3's on both sides, in a reflective, silverish shade, making for a 3-1-3. In the Woodward Avenue diamond, there's a small Olde English D on top, the only Olde English D visible on Detroit's City Connect uniforms.\n\nThe caps and batting helmets are navy blue, with an all-caps \"DETROIT\" across the front, and then a VIN number on the side. The VIN number is 190135456884, a tip of the cap to the team's founding in 1901, and its fourth world championships, in 1935, 1945, 1968 and 1984.

They haven't worn them in-game yet, but they're slated to wear them on Friday. Monday was just the official reveal, and it hasn't gone as well as those involved might have hoped. The design was criticized by fans on the initial Instagram post.\n\nEven rapper Eminem, a Detroit legend and fan of the teams in that area, couldn't get fans excited about the new jerseys. They are supposed to be a way for the team to connect with the city but many Tigers fans believe they missed the mark.\n\nThe fact that Eminem wasn't wearing the hat that goes with the new uniform had fans expressing their frustration over the jerseys once again.\n\nFans had their say, and the vast majority of them do not like this uniform whatsoever. They also don't believe that Eminem likes it, either, but he's not exactly the cheerful person in general.\n\nDetroit Tigers opening key series with Cleveland Guardians\n\nThey won't wear the City Connect uniforms until the next series against the Houston Astros, but the present series is very important for Detroit. They have three games in Cleveland against the division-leading Cleveland Guardians.\n\nAfter a brutal three-game sweep to the New York Yankees (one in which they had a lead or were tied in the seventh inning or later twice), they fell four games back of first. If they can reverse course and sweep the Guardians, they'd be one game back of first.\n\nThe Guardians are red hot, though. They currently own the third-best record in baseball, and they're playing really well. It will be a difficult series, but it's an important one even so early in the year.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eminem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Uniforms", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Uniforms", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/d6482-17150188631167-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543110", "eventUri": "eng-9543110", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

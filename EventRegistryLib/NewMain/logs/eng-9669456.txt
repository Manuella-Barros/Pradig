(Atlanta News First) - The Marietta City Schools Board unanimously approved a measure Tuesday requiring cell phones and smart watches for middle school students be stored in a locked pouch during school hours.\n\n\"I think there are a lot of teachers, not just in Marietta, but throughout metro Atlanta, who feel like they are losing the battle when it comes to student learning and cell phones,\" said Superintendent Grant Rivera.\n\n\"Research has told us that a student at this age gets somewhere between 200 to 250 notifications a day on their phone,\" said Board Chair Jeff DeJarnett. \"If that phone is in their pocket, while they are trying to concentrate on what the teacher has to say, they're more worried about notifications and who it could be and what it could be about.\"\n\nBased on the new measure, students at Marietta Sixth Grade Academy and Marietta Middle School will have their device put in a magnetic locking pouch, called a Yondr Pouch, at the start of the school day. It will be unlocked at the end of the day. Students will keep their phone with them, but they will not be accessible in the pouch.\n\nSpecial exceptions will be made for students with certain medical conditions.\n\n\"I am in full support,\" said Kayla Sargent, who has two children in middle school. \"It doesn't take a lot of interaction with a young person to see phones can be distracting.\"\n\nShe is also the executive director of the non-profit Marietta in the Middle. They took a survey of teachers and parents regarding limiting phone access, and the results were overwhelmingly in favor. 85% of participants said something needed to be done.\n\nSargent, however, said one concern did keep coming up.\n\n\"They want to see if the kids can ask access their phones if there is an active shooter. That's an unfortunate reality living in America today,\" she explained. \"The school district needs to respond to that, and I think they are doing that with pouches instead of a full ban.\"\n\nSuperintendent Rivera points out teachers can unlock the pouches in case of emergency.\n\n\"Anything that we can do in order to enhance and empower instruction and increase student behavior and student retention for information is a good thing,\" said Cobb County Association of Educators President Jeff Hubbard. \"It's going to be how school was when all of us older adults were used to it, when we didn't have cell phones, when we raised our hands and asked questions.\"\n\nRivera said they will start with middle school students this year and see how it goes before possibly implementing it in high schools or even elementary schools.\n\nOther Georgia school districts utilizing a similar system are Clarke County and Liberty County middle and high schools.\n\nAccording to Yondr, their government contracts increased tenfold since 2021, with the majority of those being school districts.", "source": {"uri": "atlantanewsfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

When students get to class, they put their phone in a pouch, close the pin to lock it and take it to their desks. The phone stays locked in the pouch during class. When class is over, they take the pouches to an \"unlocking base\" that uses a magnet to release the pin and their phone.\n\n11Alive previously reported on Milton High School using the pouches. Now, Marietta City Schools has also adopted the pouches with the goal of creating a \"nurturing educational environment that prioritizes the success and health of every student in Marietta,\" DeJarnett said.\n\n\"We all could stand to develop healthier digital habits. Just look around the restaurant next time you go out,\" DeJarnett continued. \"By helping our students develop healthier digital habits at school, we are preparing them for a future where they can use technology as a tool for learning and growth rather than a source of distraction.\"", "source": {"uri": "11alive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXIA-TV 11"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yondr", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yondr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marietta_City_Schools_(Georgia)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marietta City Schools (Georgia)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marietta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marietta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marietta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_High_School_(Georgia)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milton High School (Georgia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WXIA-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WXIA-TV"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/High_School_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/High School Health", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/578913761/578913761_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669456", "eventUri": "eng-9669456", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marietta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

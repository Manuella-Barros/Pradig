Trump delivered his remarks at the rally in Philadelphia after an event earlier in the day in Washington, D.C. At the first event, the former president came under fire for a purportedly \"incoherent\" defense of a rant he said the press had previously deemed \"rambling.\" His second event of the day stood out to social media users for a number of so-called \"misfires.\" ALSO READ: EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans subpoena ex-Capitol Police intel head for Jan. 6 inquiry \"So they were afraid for their lives in pen\u2014 think of it,\" Trump said at one point, appearing to cover up his mistake. \"They couldn\u2019t stand it. They were so afraid.. Venezuela.\" Popular account Spiro's Ghost labeled it a \"Dementia J. Trump misfire.\" \"He was totally gonna say in Pennsylvania lmao,\" wrote Bill DeMayo, @BDeMayo. @AreMond2 added, \"My Goodness he has such a hard time speaking.\" @ElvisBadgerchap said, \"We should have a drinking game during the debates where every time he says 'think of it' to cover a glitch, we take a shot. Then again, we'd all be comatose in five minutes.\" In another instance, Trump appeared to slip up when discussing the issue of drugs. \"You think of it as an ancient thing, but you know what made it... almost as big as the trug drug dealing stuff, you know what it was? The internet,\" Trump said while stumbling on his own words. \"It made it massive.\" DeMayo said, \"Tug drug is what Donnie needs to commit adultery nowadays.\" @JoelKlebanoff asked, \"Is anyone monitoring the number of verbal glitches per minute Trump has in each of his rally speeches? It seems to be getting progressively worse.\" @elliot_elraid66 also chimed in: \"Please decipher this for me...someone anybody?\" Spiro's Ghost called it \"Dementia J. Trump misfire #2.\"", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=33423757&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\"/><br/><br/><p>\n\tDonald Trump Saturday stunned critics watching his MAGA rally in Philadelphia by having numerous \"misfires\" during his speech.\n</p><p>\n\tTrump delivered his remarks at the rally in Philadelphia after an event earlier in the day in Washington, D.C.

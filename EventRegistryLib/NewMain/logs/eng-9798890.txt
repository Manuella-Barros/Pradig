The firm has already drawn up a roadmap to achieve this, as it was required to do by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nTo accomplish the necessary quality standards, Boeing will also be taking back control of Spirit AeroSystems, a company it spun off back in 2005.\n\nThe appointment of Ortberg, who began his career in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, comes after two long days of hearings organized by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of its investigation into an in-flight incident in January involving a 737 MAX 9.\n\nThe consequences of the incident was a reshuffling of executives, a freeze of 737 production by the FAA, the launch of investigations, and the reactivation of the criminal case against the company.\n\nThese are just some of the issues that Ortberg will have to tackle.\n\nAnother factor working in the new CEO's favor is that he plans to work from Seattle, the birthplace of Boeing, where the assembly lines for the 737 - its flagship aircraft - and the 777 are located.\n\nThe new generation 777X also finally seems to be within reach of certification after years of delay. On the other hand, the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 are still languishing.\n\nThe IAM-District 751 workers' union, which represents more than 30,000 Boeing employees around Seattle, called Ortberg's decision to base himself in the city \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nThe union's approval is important at a time when Boeing is negotiating its next collective agreement, which is due to come into force in September.\n\nThe union has already approved strike action if no deal is reached by this deadline.\n\nAnother major issue for Boeing is its guilty plea, announced July 24, in the criminal case relating to the crashes; the company is still waiting for the judge's decision, and civil proceedings.\n\nRobert Clifford, a lawyer representing the families of the victims, also reacted positively to Ortberg's appointment, noting his \"well-regarded reputation\" and the fact he came from outside the company.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors":

The board's investigators have interviewed workers at the 737 factory in Renton who say they are under too much pressure to produce planes quickly, leading to mistakes.\n\nDuring the hearing, a Federal Aviation Administration manager said the regulator has 16 open enforcement cases against Boeing -- three or four times the normal number -- and half started since the door-plug blowout.\n\nOrtberg will try to fix Boeing after the last two CEOs failed.\n\nDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing lifer, was fired in 2020 when the company was trying to convince regulators to let MAX jetliners resume flying after crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. David Calhoun, a longtime Boeing board member and General Electric executive, got the reworked MAX back in the air but couldn't stem losses that now exceed $25 billion since the start of 2019. Calhoun announced in March that he would step down.\n\nIn a memo to employees on Thursday, Ortberg said, \"While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I'm confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect.\"\n\nBoeing is a century-old aviation innovator with roots in Seattle, although the headquarters moved to Chicago and then to the Washington, D.C., area.

In fact, I'll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome, while also reviewing our safety and quality plans.\"\n\nThe company declined to make Ortberg available for interviews.\n\nOrtberg's name emerged relatively late in the CEO search. Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf, who led the search, said Ortberg has a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\n\nAnalysts have generally been favorable too. Richard Aboulafia, a longtime analyst and consultant in the industry, said Ortberg is deeply respected \"and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades.\"\n\nOne of Ortberg's top assignments will be fixing the manufacturing process and increasing production of MAXs, Boeing's best-selling plane. The FAA has limited Boeing to 38 per month since shortly after the Alaska Airlines blowout, but Boeing's top safety official said this week production isn't even that high - it's in the 20s per month.\n\nCalhoun did finish one job before Ortberg took over: the company reached an agreement with the Justice Department last month to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with development of the MAX. A federal judge in Texas will decide whether to approve the deal, which includes a fine of at least $244 million Boeing investing at least $455 million in quality- and safety-compliance programs.\n\nBoeing's defense and space unit is also struggling. It lost $913 million in the second quarter because of setbacks on fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets.", "source": {"uri":

He has not spoken publicly since his appointment.\n\nCalhoun will meanwhile remain a special adviser to Boeing's board of directors until March 2025.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer's finances are struggling to recover from the consequences of two fatal crashes of 2018 and 2019, and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Dave Calhoun's downfall -- announced at the end of March -- is the result of the accumulation of quality and compliance issues in Boeing's commercial aviation division.\n\n\"We see Kelly Ortberg as a win for Boeing,\" aviation experts at Melius Research wrote in an analyst note, adding that his experience as CEO of Rockwell Collins -- now an RTX subsidiary called Collins Aerospace -- \"checks a lot of boxes.\"\n\n\"He has an engineering background, experience running a public company, a multi-decade tenure in the aerospace industry, and is a Boeing outsider, which should allow for a fresh approach to solving Boeing's issues,\" they said.\n\nOrtberg is \"a positive hire\" given his prior industry experience and his role managing a large supplier,\" CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino wrote in a note to clients.\n\n- Moving on -\n\nThe most urgent issue on Ortberg's plate is undoubtedly restoring Boeing's production quality, which has been criticized in several audits. The firm has already drawn up a roadmap to achieve this, as it was required to do by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nTo accomplish the necessary quality standards, Boeing will also be taking back control of Spirit AeroSystems, a company it spun off back in 2005.\n\nThe $4.7 billion purchase, announced in early July, is due to be completed by mid-2025.\n\nThe appointment of Ortberg, who began his career in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, comes after two long days of hearings organized by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of its investigation into an in-flight incident in January involving a 737 MAX 9.\n\nThe consequences of the incident was a reshuffling of executives, a freeze of 737 production by the FAA, the launch of investigations, and the reactivation of the criminal case against the company.\n\nThese are just some of the issues that Ortberg will have to tackle.\n\nAnother factor working in the new CEO's favor is that he plans to work from Seattle, the birthplace of Boeing, where the assembly lines for the 737 - its flagship aircraft - and the 777 are located.\n\nThe new generation 777X also finally seems to be within reach of certification after years of delay. On the other hand, the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 are still languishing.\n\nThe IAM-District 751 workers' union, which represents more than 30,000 Boeing employees around Seattle, called Ortberg's decision to base himself in the city \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nThe union's approval is important at a time when Boeing is negotiating its next collective agreement, which is due to come into force in September.\n\nThe union has already approved strike action if no deal is reached by this deadline.\n\nAnother major issue for Boeing is its guilty plea, announced July 24, in the criminal case relating to the crashes; the company is still waiting for the judge's decision, and civil proceedings.\n\nRobert Clifford, a lawyer representing the families of the victims, also reacted positively to Ortberg's appointment, noting his \"well-regarded reputation\" and the fact he came from outside the company.\n\nelm-da/bfm\n\nMore from this section\n\nSecured Signing Notary Community platform

He has not spoken publicly since his appointment.\n\nCalhoun will meanwhile remain a special adviser to Boeing's board of directors until March 2025.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer's finances are struggling to recover from the consequences of two fatal crashes of 2018 and 2019, and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Dave Calhoun's downfall -- announced at the end of March -- is the result of the accumulation of quality and compliance issues in Boeing's commercial aviation division.\n\n\"We see Kelly Ortberg as a win for Boeing,\" aviation experts at Melius Research wrote in an analyst note, adding that his experience as CEO of Rockwell Collins -- now an RTX subsidiary called Collins Aerospace -- \"checks a lot of boxes.\"\n\n\"He has an engineering background, experience running a public company, a multi-decade tenure in the aerospace industry, and is a Boeing outsider, which should allow for a fresh approach to solving Boeing's issues,\" they said.\n\nOrtberg is \"a positive hire\" given his prior industry experience and his role managing a large supplier,\" CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino wrote in a note to clients.\n\n- Moving on -\n\nThe most urgent issue on Ortberg's plate is undoubtedly restoring Boeing's production quality, which has been criticized in several audits. The firm has already drawn up a roadmap to achieve this, as it was required to do by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nTo accomplish the necessary quality standards, Boeing will also be taking back control of Spirit AeroSystems, a company it spun off back in 2005.\n\nMore from this section Panama dismantles 'VIP' Chinese migrant route in Darien jungle 'Let's get them!' Maduro's campaign to flush out 'traitors' Augusta, Georgia Tees Up More Than Golf With Ten New Authentic Experiences\n\nThe $4.7 billion purchase, announced in early July, is due to be completed by mid-2025.\n\nThe appointment of Ortberg, who began his career in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, comes after two long days of hearings organized by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of its investigation into an in-flight incident in January involving a 737 MAX 9.\n\nThe consequences of the incident was a reshuffling of executives, a freeze of 737 production by the FAA, the launch of investigations, and the reactivation of the criminal case against the company.\n\nThese are just some of the issues that Ortberg will have to tackle.\n\nAnother factor working in the new CEO's favor is that he plans to work from Seattle, the birthplace of Boeing, where the assembly lines for the 737 - its flagship aircraft - and the 777 are located.\n\nThe new generation 777X also finally seems to be within reach of certification after years of delay. On the other hand, the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 are still languishing.\n\nThe IAM-District 751 workers' union, which represents more than 30,000 Boeing employees around Seattle, called Ortberg's decision to base himself in the city \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nThe union's approval is important at a time when Boeing is negotiating its next collective agreement, which is due to come into force in September.\n\nThe union has already approved strike action if no deal is reached by this deadline.\n\nAnother major issue for Boeing is its guilty plea, announced July 24, in the criminal case relating to the crashes; the company is still waiting for the judge's decision, and civil proceedings.\n\nRobert Clifford, a lawyer representing the families of the victims, also reacted positively to Ortberg's appointment, noting his \"well-regarded reputation\" and the fact he came from outside the company.\n\nelm-da/bfm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A new chief executive takes over at Boeing on Thursday, and he plans to walk the floor of the factory near Seattle that has become the heart of the aerospace giant's troubles.\n\nCrystal City (US), Aug 8 (AP) A new chief executive takes over at Boeing on Thursday, and he plans to walk the floor of the factory near Seattle that has become the heart of the aerospace giant's troubles.\n\nRobert \"Kelly\" Ortberg takes over a money-losing company that has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, is struggling fix its aircraft-manufacturing process, and can't bring two astronauts home from the International Space Station because of flaws in a spacecraft it built for NASA.\n\nAlso Read | 'This Is Our First Responsibility': Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus Ensures No Attack Anywhere in Bangladesh Amidst Political Turmoil.\n\n\"I'm excited to dig in!\" Ortberg told employees on his first day in the job.\n\nBoeing announced Ortberg's selection just over a week ago, on the same day that it posted another huge loss; more than $1.4 billion in the second quarter, which was marked by a steep drop in deliveries of new airline planes, including the 737 Max.\n\nAlso Read | World's Hottest Month in 2024: July Marks Second-Warmest Month on Record Worldwide, Says EU Climate Agency.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board just wrapped up a two-day hearing on the 737 Max that suffered a blowout of a panel in the side of the plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. The board's investigators have interviewed workers at the 737 factory in Renton, Washington, who say they are under too much pressure to produce planes quickly, leading to mistakes.\n\nDuring the hearing, a Federal Aviation Administration manager said the regulator has 16 open enforcement cases against Boeing -- three or four times the normal number -- and half started since the door-plug blowout.\n\nOrtberg will try to fix Boeing after the last two CEOs failed.\n\nDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing lifer, was fired in 2020 when the company was trying to convince regulators to let Max jetliners resume flying after crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. David Calhoun, a longtime Boeing board member and General Electric executive, got the reworked Max back in the air but couldn't stem losses that now exceed $25 billion since the start of 2019. Calhoun announced in March that he would step down.\n\nIn a memo to employees on Thursday, Ortberg said, \"While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I'm confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect.\"\n\nBoeing is a century-old aviation innovator with roots in Seattle, although the headquarters moved to Chicago and then to the Washington, DC, area. The new CEO is planting a symbolic flag in the ground back in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\"Because what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company,\" Ortberg told employees. \"I plan to be based in Seattle so that I can be close to the commercial airplane programs. In fact, I'll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome, while also reviewing our safety and quality plans.\"\n\nThe company declined to make Ortberg available for interviews.\n\nOrtberg's name emerged relatively late in the CEO search. Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf, who led the search, said Ortberg has a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\n\nAnalysts have generally been favourable too. Richard Aboulafia, a longtime analyst and consultant in the industry, said Ortberg is deeply respected \"and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades\".\n\nOne of Ortberg's top assignments will be fixing the manufacturing process and increasing production of Max jets, Boeing's best-selling plane. The FAA has limited Boeing to 38 per month since shortly after the Alaska Airlines blowout, but Boeing's top safety official said this week production isn't even that high -- it's in the 20s per month.\n\nCalhoun did finish one job before Ortberg took over: the company reached an agreement with the Justice Department last month to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will decide whether to approve the deal, which includes a fine of at least $244 million Boeing investing at least $455 million in quality- and safety-compliance programmes.\n\nBoeing's defence and space unit is also struggling. It lost $913 million in the second quarter because of setbacks on fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets.

Click and follow now!\n\nAviation experts and analysts have been full of praise for Kelly Ortberg, who returns from early retirement Thursday to take up the challenge of turning Boeing around after a series of quality and financial issues.\n\nThe appointment of 64-year-old Ortberg to succeed outgoing Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun was announced on July 31, the same day the US aerospace giant posted a second-quarter loss of more than $1.4 billion.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" Ortberg said in a statement. He has not spoken publicly since his appointment.\n\nCalhoun will meanwhile remain a special adviser to Boeing's board of directors until March 2025.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer's finances are struggling to recover from the consequences of two fatal crashes of 2018 and 2019, and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Dave Calhoun's downfall -- announced at the end of March -- is the result of the accumulation of quality and compliance issues in Boeing's commercial aviation division.\n\n\"We see Kelly Ortberg as a win for Boeing,\" aviation experts at Melius Research wrote in an analyst note, adding that his experience as CEO of Rockwell Collins -- now an RTX subsidiary called Collins Aerospace -- \"checks a lot of boxes.\"\n\n\"He has an engineering background, experience running a public company, a multi-decade tenure in the aerospace industry, and is a Boeing outsider, which should allow for a fresh approach to solving Boeing's issues,\" they said.\n\nOrtberg is \"a positive hire\" given his prior industry experience and his role managing a large supplier,\" CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino wrote in a note to clients.\n\nMoving on\n\nThe most urgent issue on Ortberg's plate is undoubtedly restoring Boeing's production quality, which has been criticized in several audits. The firm has already drawn up a roadmap to achieve this, as it was required to do by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nTo accomplish the necessary quality standards, Boeing will also be taking back control of Spirit AeroSystems, a company it spun off back in 2005.\n\nThe $4.7 billion purchase, announced in early July, is due to be completed by mid-2025.\n\nThe appointment of Ortberg, who began his career in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, comes after two long days of hearings organized by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of its investigation into an in-flight incident in January involving a 737 MAX 9.\n\nThe consequences of the incident was a reshuffling of executives, a freeze of 737 production by the FAA, the launch of investigations, and the reactivation of the criminal case against the company.\n\nThese are just some of the issues that Ortberg will have to tackle.\n\nAnother factor working in the new CEO's favor is that he plans to work from Seattle, the birthplace of Boeing, where the assembly lines for the 737 - its flagship aircraft - and the 777 are located.\n\nThe new generation 777X also finally seems to be within reach of certification after years of delay. On the other hand, the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 are still languishing.\n\nThe IAM-District 751 workers' union, which represents more than 30,000 Boeing employees around Seattle, called Ortberg's decision to base himself in the city \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nThe union's approval is important at a time when Boeing is negotiating its next collective agreement, which is due to come into force in September.\n\nThe union has already approved strike action if no deal is reached by this deadline.\n\nAnother major issue for Boeing is its guilty plea, announced July 24, in the criminal case relating to the crashes; the company is still waiting for the judge's decision, and civil proceedings.\n\nRobert Clifford, a lawyer representing the families of the victims, also reacted positively to Ortberg's appointment, noting his \"well-regarded reputation\" and the fact he came from outside the company.", "source": {"uri": "yen.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yen.com.gh -

The board's investigators have interviewed workers at the 737 factory in Renton, Washington, who say they are under too much pressure to produce planes quickly, leading to mistakes.\n\nDuring the hearing, a Federal Aviation Administration manager said the regulator has 16 open enforcement cases against Boeing - three or four times the normal number - and half started since the door-plug blowout.\n\nFILE - The Boeing 777X airplane is shown at the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget, north of Paris, France, on June 19, 2023. (AP Photo/Lewis Joly, File)\n\nOrtberg will try to fix Boeing after the last two CEOs failed.\n\nDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing lifer, was fired in 2020 when the company was trying to convince regulators to let Max jetliners resume flying after crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. David Calhoun, a longtime Boeing board member and General Electric executive, got the reworked Max back in the air but couldn\u00b4t stem losses that now exceed $25 billion since the start of 2019. Calhoun announced in March that he would step down.\n\nIn a memo to employees on Thursday, Ortberg said, \"While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I\u00b4m confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect.\"\n\nBoeing is a century-old aviation innovator with roots in Seattle, although the headquarters moved to Chicago and then to the Washington, D.C., area. The new CEO is planting a symbolic flag in the ground back in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\"Because what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company,\" Ortberg told employees. \"I plan to be based in Seattle so that I can be close to the commercial airplane programs. In fact, I\u00b4ll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome, while also reviewing our safety and quality plans.\"\n\nThe company declined to make Ortberg available for interviews.\n\nOrtberg\u00b4s name emerged relatively late in the CEO search. Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf, who led the search, said Ortberg has a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\n\nAnalysts have generally been favorable too. Richard Aboulafia, a longtime analyst and consultant in the industry, said Ortberg is deeply respected \"and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades.\"\n\nOne of Ortberg\u00b4s top assignments will be fixing the manufacturing process and increasing production of Max jets, Boeing\u00b4s best-selling plane. The FAA has limited Boeing to 38 per month since shortly after the Alaska Airlines blowout, but Boeing\u00b4s top safety official said this week production isn\u00b4t even that high - it\u00b4s in the 20s per month.\n\nCalhoun did finish one job before Ortberg took over: the company reached an agreement with the Justice Department last month to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will decide whether to approve the deal, which includes a fine of at least $244 million Boeing investing at least $455 million in quality- and safety-compliance programs.\n\nBoeing\u00b4s defense and space unit is also struggling. It lost $913 million in the second quarter because of setbacks on fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets.", "source": {"uri":

Effective August 8, Robert \"Kelly\" Ortberg, the former CEO of Rockwell Collins, will succeed the retiring Dave Calhoun.\n\nThe transition follows a troubling financial report, with Boeing posting a $1.4 billion core operating loss in the second quarter -- more than triple last year's loss -- due to increased scrutiny of aircraft safety and quality, which has hindered production and profitability.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" said Ortberg in a statement from the company. \"Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront.\"\n\nOrtberg, with a background in mechanical engineering, is regarded as a potentially beneficial addition due to his experience and reputation in the aerospace sector. His selection is considered a pivotal step, particularly in light of the 737 Max incidents, which resulted in two fatal crashes attributed to a design flaw, a grounding for 20 months, and financial damages exceeding $20 billion.\n\nBoeing's ongoing issues encompass a recent occurrence involving a door plug detaching from a 737 Max, allegations of employing inferior components, and whistleblower claims of retaliatory actions taken against employees who raised safety issues.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" said Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf in a statement. \"We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\nThe new CEO inherits a company with ongoing difficulties. Boeing's commercial and defense sectors are underperforming, evidenced by nearly doubling losses in its defense, space, and security unit to $913 million. Complications with the Starliner spaceship and the costly Air Force One project further compound Boeing's financial woes. The company's recovery is constrained by a necessary production slowdown of the 737 Max, demanded by the FAA until safety and quality issues are resolved.\n\n\"The arrival of a new CEO at Boeing could not have happened at a more crucial and necessary time for the safety of the traveling public around the world,\" said Robert Clifford, attorney for the families of 737 Max crash victims. He said that under Muilenberg, Calhoun, and Boeing's \"do nothing\" board, the company has been in a \"nosedive.\"\n\n\"While this man is an industry insider, he comes from outside Boeing and, on the face of it, has a well-regarded reputation in the industry,\" Clifford added. \"Maybe he can bring the company back to the stature it once held before it criminally and preventively killed 346 people.\"\n\nAdditionally, Boeing faces a potential strike by 36,000 hourly workers in Washington state, which could further disrupt its operations. The company's leadership has undergone significant changes this year, with Calhoun indicating that further personnel shifts under Ortberg are unlikely.\n\n\"One person cannot turn around a company, but Kelly should be able to cast a wider net for talent than a Boeing insider could,\" said Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst for Bank of America.\n\n\"Demand for commercial aircraft remains strong, and in a duopoly, Boing should be a beneficiary, in our view,\" Epstein added. \"We do note that Ortberg is walking into a Boeing with a potential production strike in September, a defense business that is limping along, and commercial business that has lost the trust of regulators and the public. Boeing overall has a long road ahead if the underperformance in this quarter is an indicator of what's to come.\"\n\nBoeing's stock initially dropped but then recovered slightly upon the news of Ortberg's appointment, highlighting investor uncertainty.\n\n\"He knows full well that we're in a recovery mode,\" Calhoun told investors. \"I don't think this is intended to be a large personnel overhaul.\"\n\nBoeing's journey back to stability will be arduous, with Ortberg tasked with restoring public and regulatory trust, enhancing safety standards, and navigating a challenging labor landscape. The new CEO's reputation and outsider status may offer a fresh perspective and new strategies to address these deep-seated issues.", "source": {"uri": "wonderfulengineering.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonderful Engineering"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ezgif.com-resize-7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798890", "eventUri": "eng-9798890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 112, "textEnd": 120}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The result meant that Boeing hasn't had a profitable year since 2019, and since then has accumulated whopping operating losses totaling $33.3 billion.\n\nCurrently the company is still struggling to convince regulators that it has finally fixed its issues on all of its current aircraft programs.\n\nThe US aviation authority, FAA, has capped Boeing's output of 737 MAX production at 38 aircraft a month , while Boeing aims at increasing it to 50 MAXs a month in order to satisfy high demand.\n\nThe inward-looking, subdued current state of Boeing was on stark display only in late July at the Farnborough Air Show outside London, one of the major industry events. While neither nor Boeing reaped a flood of major new orders, Boeing had severely curtailed its appearance altogether. Claiming it wanted to concentrate on the pressing safety and quality fixes, it hadn't sent a single commercial aircraft to the major air show, an unprecedented occurrence.\n\nBoeing's CEO for the Commercial Airplanes Division, Stephanie Pope, appeared subdued and tight-lipped at their only official media appearance at the Farnborough event. She was among the candidates to take the top post from Dave Calhoun, but many voices and probably the board favored an outside expert to turn the aircraft maker's fortunes around.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" said Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf in a statement following Ortberg's appointment. \"We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\nRarely had an appointment for a top job received such unanimous praise as Ortberg's. He is seen in the industry as an experienced expert and an efficient and likable leader.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better selection,\" aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia told industry publication Flightglobal.\n\nBoeing share prices reacted immediately to the news of Ortberg's appointment. After initially falling on the financial results they rose more than 1%. But still Boeing shares are still languishing 28% below their value at the beginning of the year.\n\nFocusing on share price rather than product quality and safety was exactly the recipe for disaster taking Boeing where it is now. Ever since the company merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, and adopting the strategy of that smaller company in the process, the famed aircraft manufacturer lost its engineering clout while recording record profits and dividends.\n\nNow hopes are huge for Kelly Ortberg to finally reverse course, and early signs are encouraging for workers, analysts -- and even for the families of the victims of two fatal Boeing crashes in 2018 and 2019 that led to a lengthy grounding of the 737 MAX plane.\n\n\"The arrival of a new CEO at Boeing could not have happened at a more crucial and necessary time for the safety of the traveling public around the world,\" CNN quoted Robert Clifford, attorney for the families of crash victims, as saying.\n\nClifford noted that under recent Boeing CEOs, Dennis Muilenburg and Dave Calhoun, as well as Boeing's \"do nothing\" board, the company has been in a \"nosedive.\" But now there is hope as Ortberg came from \"outside of Boeing\" and had a \"well-regarded reputation.\"\n\nIn order for Ortberg to take over as Boeing CEO, the company's board is even waiving the mandatory CEO retirement age of 65.\n\nUS media reported that Ortberg has already taken a far-reaching decision, which could be of major psychological importance. He wants to base himself in Seattle, Washington, which industry experts interpret as indicating the ill-fated 2001 move of corporate headquarters away from Boeing's center of engineering and production to first Chicago and then Virginia might be reversed as well.\n\nThat would not only be a big boost of confidence for Boeing's core workforce, it alone could even help avoid a looming strike by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 in Seattle.\n\nSeattle Times aerospace reporter Dominic Gates told a local radio station that one of the machinists' demands is that Boeing \"commit to building the next airplane here and to stop threatening them to take work away.\"\n\n\"I suspect he's going to give them what they ask for. And if he does, we could avoid a strike,\" he added, which would be a good start for the Ortberg era.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Meanwhile, Boeing shares are down some 37% so far this year, as of Wednesday.\n\nOrtberg's Day 1 activity is walking the floor of Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington, where it builds its best-selling but problematic 737 Max. He plans to talk with employees and review safety and quality plans, with similar visits ahead at other Boeing plants.\n\n\"I can't tell you how proud and excited I am to be a member of the Boeing team,\" he said in a note to staff on Thursday. \"While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I'm confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect.\"\n\nAnalysts and industry insiders are cautiously upbeat, painting the 64-year-old Ortberg -- a more than three-decade veteran of the industry who spent years atop commercial and defense supplier Rockwell Collins after working up the ranks there -- as a good listener with an engineering background (he has a mechanical engineering degree). Perhaps most importantly, he is a Boeing outsider.\n\n\"This guy has a fantastic reputation and level of experience in the industry,\" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \"He has a reputation for listening and for letting people push back.\"\n\nThose skills will be key as Boeing tries to stabilize its production and eliminate manufacturing flaws.\n\nBoeing's top safety executive for commercial aerospace told a National Transportation Safety Board hearing earlier this week that the company is working on a design fix so the near-catastrophic door plug blowout it faced at the beginning of the year never happens again.\n\nThe hearing was part of the NTSB's probe of the the midair blowout of a door plug from a packed, months-old Boeing 737 Max 9 as it climbed out of Oregon. While no one was seriously injured in the accident, it put Boeing back into crisis mode just as it was trying to move on from two fatal crashes of its best-selling 737 Max planes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nWorker testimony at the NTSB hearing also showed manufacturing pressure and frequent fixes on planes, putting a spotlight on Boeing's factories.\n\n\"I will be transparent with you every step of the way, sharing news on progress as well as where we must do things better,\" Ortberg said in the memo. He vowed to share reports to staff, \"giving you timely updates of what I'm seeing and hearing on the ground from our teammates and our stakeholders.\"\n\nBoeing last month agreed to plead guilty to defrauding the U.S. government during the Max certification, a deal that will require an independent corporate monitor at the company for three years.\n\nBut Ortberg will have to address issues not only in the commercial jet business, including the delayed certification of new 737 and 777 models, but also in its defense unit.\n\nThat segment of the business is facing issues with two 747s that will serve as the next Air Force One aircraft but are years behind schedule. Meanwhile, Boeing's misfiring Starliner capsule, which launched in early June, has NASA debating whether to use SpaceX instead to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back from the International Space Station.\n\nA decision is also looming over whether to launch a new aircraft as Boeing loses ground to rival Airbus.\n\nThe first 100 days of Ortberg's time as CEO will be crucial, said Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein.\n\n\"The decisions made early in his tenure will have generational impacts on the company,\" he said in a note on Monday.\n\nOrtberg and his team will need to ensure Boeing's workforce is trained, with thousands of new workers in factories after more experienced staff members took buyouts or were laid off in the pandemic. A union representing some 30,000 Boeing factory workers in Washington state and Oregon is seeking more than 40% raises and, last month, members authorized a strike if a deal isn't reached this September.\n\n\"The principles of safety and quality should be equally important as the manufacturing rates,\" Jon Holden, local president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said in a statement last week. \"This potential collaboration with the new CEO could be a prime opportunity for Boeing to prove its dedication to its workforce and acknowledge the exceptional manufacturing capability and capacity of skilled IAM Members on the shop floor.\"\n\nLast week, alongside another quarterly loss, Boeing announced Ortberg would replace Dave Calhoun, who had said in March he would step down by year's end.\n\nThat was part of a larger executive shakeup after the door plug blowout. Calhoun himself took over a Boeing in crisis in early 2020, replacing Dennis Muilenburg, who was ousted for his handling of the two Max crashes.\n\nWhile Boeing is still based in Arlington, Virginia -- where it announced it would move its headquarters in 2022 from Chicago -- Ortberg will be based in the Seattle area, giving him a close eye on where the majority of Boeing's commercial jetliner production is based.\n\n\"In speaking with our customers and industry partners leading up to today, I can tell you that without exception, everyone wants us to succeed,\" Otberg said in his Day 1 note to employees. \"In many cases, they NEED us to succeed. This is a great foundation for us to build upon.\"\n\nGetting off on the right foot with customers and the hundreds of suppliers that are struggling from pandemic-demand whiplash is important for Ortberg and the company. Boeing's relationships with its bread-and-butter customers has suffered recently, and its leadership shakeup came after airline CEOs sought a meeting with the company's board as delays of aircraft piled up in the wake of the doorplug blowout.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is among Boeing's biggest customers and, like other carriers, has scaled back its growth plans, citing delivery delays of new, more-fuel efficient jets from Boeing. The airline's CEO hinted at the big feat Ortberg has ahead of him.\n\n\"We look forward to working with Kelly Ortberg in his efforts to return Boeing to its place as the leading American aerospace company,\" CEO Bob Jordan said in a written statement. \"A strong Boeing is great for Southwest Airlines and it's great for our industry.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcwashington.com", "dataType": "news",

Sign up for NBC Boston's newsletters.\n\nThat enormous goal will involve thousands of daily decisions that will determine whether Boeing can earn back the trust of regulators, airlines and the public; end persistent production defects; deliver aircraft on time and consistently to customers large and small; and stop burning cash.\n\nThat cash burn is running about $8 billion so far this year and counting. Meanwhile, Boeing shares are down some 37% so far in 2024, as of Wednesday.\n\nOrtberg's Day 1 activity is walking the floor of Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington, where it builds its bestselling but problematic 737 Max. He plans to talk with employees and review safety and quality plans, with similar visits ahead at other Boeing plants.\n\n\"I can't tell you how proud and excited I am to be a member of the Boeing team,\" he said in a note to staff on Thursday. \"While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I'm confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect.\"\n\nAnalysts and industry insiders are cautiously upbeat, painting the 64-year-old Ortberg -- a more than three-decade veteran of the industry who spent years atop commercial and defense supplier Rockwell Collins after working up the ranks there -- as a good listener with an engineering background (he has a mechanical engineering degree). Perhaps most importantly, he is a Boeing outsider.\n\n\"This guy has a fantastic reputation and level of experience in the industry,\" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \"He has a reputation for listening and for letting people push back.\"\n\nThose skills will be key as Boeing tries to stabilize its production and eliminate manufacturing flaws.\n\nBoeing's top safety executive for commercial aerospace told a National Transportation Safety Board hearing earlier this week that the company is working on a design fix so the near-catastrophic door plug blowout it faced at the beginning of the year never happens again.\n\nThe hearing was part of the NTSB's probe of the midair blowout of a door plug from a packed, monthsold Boeing 737 Max 9 as it climbed out of Portland, Oregon. While no one was seriously injured in the accident, it put Boeing back into crisis mode just as it was trying to move on from two fatal crashes of its bestselling 737 Max planes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nWorker testimony at the NTSB hearing also showed manufacturing pressure and frequent fixes on planes, putting a spotlight on Boeing's factories.\n\n\"I will be transparent with you every step of the way, sharing news on progress as well as where we must do things better,\" Ortberg said in the memo. He vowed to share reports to staff, \"giving you timely updates of what I'm seeing and hearing on the ground from our teammates and our stakeholders.\"\n\nBoeing last month agreed to plead guilty to defrauding the U.S. government during the Max certification, a deal that will require an independent corporate monitor at the company for three years.\n\nBut Ortberg will have to address issues not only in the commercial jet business, including the delayed certification of new 737 and 777 models, but also in its defense unit.\n\nThat segment of the business is facing issues with two 747s that will serve as the next Air Force One aircraft but are years behind schedule. Meanwhile, Boeing's misfiring Starliner capsule, which launched in early June, has NASA debating whether to use SpaceX instead to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back from the International Space Station.\n\nA decision is also looming over whether to launch a new aircraft as Boeing loses ground to rival Airbus.\n\nThe first 100 days of Ortberg's time as CEO will be crucial, said Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein.\n\n\"The decisions made early in his tenure will have generational impacts on the company,\" he said in a note Monday.\n\nOrtberg and his team will need to ensure Boeing's workforce is trained, with thousands of new workers in factories after more experienced staff members took buyouts or were laid off in the pandemic. A union representing some 30,000 Boeing factory workers in Washington state and Oregon is seeking more than 40% raises and, last month, members authorized a strike if a deal isn't reached this September.\n\n\"The principles of safety and quality should be equally important as the manufacturing rates,\" Jon Holden, local president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said in a statement last week. \"This potential collaboration with the new CEO could be a prime opportunity for Boeing to prove its dedication to its workforce and acknowledge the exceptional manufacturing capability and capacity of skilled IAM Members on the shop floor.\"\n\nLast week, alongside another quarterly loss, Boeing announced Ortberg would succeed Dave Calhoun, who had said in March he would step down by year's end.\n\nThat was part of a larger executive shake-up after the door plug blowout. Calhoun himself took over a Boeing in crisis in early 2020, replacing Dennis Muilenburg, who was ousted for his handling of the two Max crashes.\n\nWhile Boeing is still based in Arlington, Virginia -- where it announced it would move its headquarters in 2022 from Chicago -- Ortberg will be based in the Seattle area, giving him a close eye on where the majority of Boeing's commercial jetliner production is based.\n\n\"In speaking with our customers and industry partners leading up to today, I can tell you that without exception, everyone wants us to succeed,\" Otberg said in his Day 1 note to employees. \"In many cases, they NEED us to succeed. This is a great foundation for us to build upon.\"\n\nGetting off on the right foot with customers and the hundreds of suppliers that are struggling from pandemic-demand whiplash is important for Ortberg and the company. Boeing's relationships with its bread-and-butter customers has suffered recently, and its leadership shake-up came after airline CEOs sought a meeting with the company's board as delays of aircraft piled up in the wake of the door plug blowout.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is among Boeing's biggest customers and, like other carriers, has scaled back its growth plans, citing delivery delays of new, more fuel-efficient jets from Boeing. The airline's CEO hinted at the big feat Ortberg has ahead of him.\n\n\"We look forward to working with Kelly Ortberg in his efforts to return Boeing to its place as the leading American aerospace company,\" CEO Bob Jordan said in a written statement. \"A strong Boeing is great for Southwest Airlines and it's great for our industry.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news",

The result meant that Boeing hasn't had a profitable year since 2019, and since then has accumulated whopping operating losses totaling $33.3 billion.\n\nCurrently the company is still struggling to convince regulators that it has finally fixed its major problems with safety and quality control issues on all of its current aircraft programs.\n\nThe US aviation authority, FAA, has capped Boeing's output of 737 MAX production at 38 aircraft a month due to these unsolved issues, while Boeing aims at increasing it to 50 MAXs a month in order to satisfy high demand.\n\nThe inward-looking, subdued current state of Boeing was on stark display only in late July at the Farnborough Air Show outside London, one of the major industry events. While neither Airbus nor Boeing reaped a flood of major new orders, Boeing had severely curtailed its appearance altogether. Claiming it wanted to concentrate on the pressing safety and quality fixes, it hadn't sent a single commercial aircraft to the major air show, an unprecedented occurrence.\n\nBoeing's CEO for the Commercial Airplanes Division, Stephanie Pope, appeared subdued and tight-lipped at their only official media appearance at the Farnborough event. She was among the candidates to take the top post from Dave Calhoun, but many voices and probably the board favored an outside expert to turn the aircraft maker's fortunes around.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" said Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf in a statement following Ortberg's appointment. \"We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\nRarely had an appointment for a top job received such unanimous praise as Ortberg's. He is seen in the industry as an experienced expert and an efficient and likable leader.\n\n\"You couldn't ask for a better selection,\" aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia told industry publication Flightglobal.\n\nBoeing share prices reacted immediately to the news of Ortberg's appointment. After initially falling on the financial results they rose more than 1%. But still Boeing shares are still languishing 28% below their value at the beginning of the year.\n\nFocusing on share price rather than product quality and safety was exactly the recipe for disaster taking Boeing where it is now. Ever since the company merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, and adopting the strategy of that smaller company in the process, the famed aircraft manufacturer lost its engineering clout while recording record profits and dividends.\n\nNow hopes are huge for Kelly Ortberg to finally reverse course, and early signs are encouraging for workers, analysts -- and even for the families of the victims of two fatal Boeing crashes in 2018 and 2019 that led to a lengthy grounding of the 737 MAX plane.\n\n\"The arrival of a new CEO at Boeing could not have happened at a more crucial and necessary time for the safety of the traveling public around the world,\" CNN quoted Robert Clifford, attorney for the families of crash victims, as saying.\n\nClifford noted that under recent Boeing CEOs, Dennis Muilenburg and Dave Calhoun, as well as Boeing's \"do nothing\" board, the company has been in a \"nosedive.\" But now there is hope as Ortberg came from \"outside of Boeing\" and had a \"well-regarded reputation.\"\n\nIn order for Ortberg to take over as Boeing CEO, the company's board is even waiving the mandatory CEO retirement age of 65.\n\nUS media reported that Ortberg has already taken a far-reaching decision, which could be of major psychological importance. He wants to base himself in Seattle, Washington, which industry experts interpret as indicating the ill-fated 2001 move of corporate headquarters away from Boeing's center of engineering and production to first Chicago and then Virginia might be reversed as well.\n\nThat would not only be a big boost of confidence for Boeing's core workforce, it alone could even help avoid a looming strike by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 in Seattle.\n\nSeattle Times aerospace reporter Dominic Gates told a local radio station that one of the machinists' demands is that Boeing \"commit to building the next airplane here and to stop threatening them to take work away.\"\n\n\"I suspect he's going to give them what they ask for. And if he does, we could avoid a strike,\" he added, which would be a good start for the Ortberg era.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [],

He's being handed a company in crisis.", "body": "Robert \"Kelly\" Ortberg was well known on Wall Street for striking big deals as the leader of Rockwell Collins. But back in Iowa, the aerospace executive was known for paying attention to issues that rarely made headlines, like the VIP spots in the company parking lot.\n\nWith little fanfare, Ortberg removed the assigned spaces for higher-ranking employees at the headquarters of Rockwell Collins. Brad Neilly, an employee, recalled how one Friday night he walked out of the building at the same time as Ortberg. The chief executive had parked even further away from the building, \"deep into the parking lot,\" Neilly wrote on LinkedIn in 2021. \"It was a little thing but had a big impact on me.\"\n\nOrtberg, 64, who takes over Thursday as the CEO of Boeing, will need both strategic vision and an eye for such details as he tries to revamp an American manufacturing giant that has been hobbled by production delays, factory flubs and quality lapses that have marred its reputation and drained its finances.\n\nIt is a turnaround that his two predecessors -- Dennis Muilenburg, an engineer who spent his entire career climbing the Boeing ranks, and David Calhoun, a General Electric veteran and Blackstone executive with a fix-it reputation -- attempted and failed to pull off.\n\n\"They clearly need to get back to basics, and Kelly is a person who will do that,\" said Don Beall, former CEO of what was then Rockwell International, who worked with Ortberg as he rose through the company. \"He's a very hands-on guy. He'll get out on the shop floor.\"\n\nBoeing -- whose nearly $80 billion in annual revenue dwarfs the $5 billion at Ortberg's prior employer -- has a raft of problems. It faces federal monitoring due to its guilty-plea agreement related to two fatal 737 MAX crashes. Investigators are probing how a fuselage panel on a 737 MAX fell out midair on a Jan. 5 flight. Workers have portrayed management as dismissive of quality and safety concerns due to its \"push, push, push, go, go, go\" focus on production, according to evidence released this week by U.S. accident investigators. It has burned through more than $8 billion in six months, sparking liquidity fears.\n\nOrtberg declined to comment. Boeing says it has taken steps to improve quality and cooperated with federal probes. Calhoun recently apologized to the families of the MAX crash victims and acknowledged the company's culture was far from perfect.\n\nOrtberg spent much of his life and early career in Iowa. He grew up in Dubuque, where his father worked at John Deere and his mother cared for him and three siblings. A former Boy Scout who achieved the top rank of Eagle, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Iowa, about an hour-and-a-half drive from his hometown.\n\nThe coming-of-age TV show 'The Wonder Years,' which he liked, reminded him of his childhood, Ortberg said in a 2013 interview with Iowa Now, a university publication. \"This upbringing instilled some key values in me that have served me well. You need to work hard to earn your keep,\" he said.\n\nAfter graduation, Ortberg spent much of the next three decades in nearby Cedar Rapids, where he rose through the ranks at Rockwell Collins, a niche supplier of avionics and interiors that Ortberg sold to rival United Technologies in 2018. A successor company was later renamed RTX.\n\nHe was living in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he had retired after stepping down from RTX in 2021, when Boeing called. He remained on the RTX board until last week when he took the Boeing job.\n\nFormer Rockwell Collins CEO Clay Jones, Ortberg's immediate predecessor and a longtime mentor, said he believed Ortberg was content in retirement. Jones was surprised when Ortberg called him to say he was considering the Boeing job. But, as they discussed the role, Jones said, \"it made perfect sense.\"\n\nOrtberg and his wife will be moving to Seattle, where Boeing has factories that build its 737 and 777 planes. Boeing's headquarters, once in the Seattle area, are now in Arlington, Va.\n\nHe will have less time for his favorite pastime: golf. He told Iowa Now he loved to play because it is a time when he can shut off his cellphone and, he said, \"it's a game that keeps you humble, and there's only one person to get credit or blame for the results.\"\n\nIn Ortberg, Boeing's board has selected an outsider who is intimately familiar with the plane maker's vast supply chain. Former Boeing executives who have worked with him describe him as a good listener with deep relationships across the industry, including with airlines frustrated by the manufacturer's persistent delivery delays.\n\nAlan Mulally, the former head of Boeing's commercial business who left in 2006 to steer a turnaround at Ford, said that Ortberg while at Rockwell Collins was key in developing the cockpit for the 777 and 787 jetliners -- from flight control to vision systems to maps -- and that doing so required him to navigate the needs of Boeing, suppliers, pilots, regulators and air traffic officials.\n\nOrtberg has the temperament and experience, he said, to create an environment in which employees feel safe flagging problems.\n\n\"As an engineer, this is the way we grow up,\" Mulally said. \"The whole idea is that you are creating a skilled, healthy and psychologically safe environment because that type of environment is what allows people to share everything that's going on.\"\n\nOrtberg took over the Rockwell Collins commercial unit in 2009 amid the global economic crisis and then the company's government business a few years later when the U.S. was drastically cutting military spending. He presided over layoffs and restructurings and was able to maintain high morale and quality, said Jones, his old boss.\n\n\"He faces issues head on. He doesn't sugarcoat them,\" Jones said. \"He communicates well to his people so they know what the circumstances are, and they know there is cause and effect.\"\n\nOrtberg expanded Rockwell Collins with a pair of acquisitions, including one deal that he struck just a few days after taking over as CEO in 2013. He had a habit of obsessively communicating with board members, former directors say, often calling them individually to update them on acquisition developments.\n\nThe executive offices at Rockwell Collins were close by the manufacturing lines, said Kevin Michaels, an aerospace consultant who started his career alongside Ortberg. \"He liked to see the operations -- and learn,\" he said of Ortberg.\n\nAt Rockwell Collins, he understood how the products worked, walked factory floors and knew up-and-coming employees. He also appeared at ease talking about detailed product issues with engineers and others, skills people who worked with him there expect him to apply at Boeing.\n\n\"He's just going to dig, dig, dig,\" said Andrew Policano, a former business-school dean who spent about 12 years on the Rockwell Collins board, working closely with Ortberg.\n\nWhen asked difficult questions in board meetings, Ortberg would often pause and consider what was being asked. \"Kelly is not the kind of person to shoot from the hip,\" Policano said. \"It was always clear to everyone around the table that he knew every aspect of what needed to take place.\"\n\nAn ardent Iowa Hawkeyes fan, Ortberg once invited Policano and his wife to a college-football game.\n\nWhen the director arrived, Ortberg ushered him to an RV in the parking lot, where his friends were tailgating. \"There's no greater fan than Kelly,\" Policano said. \"You've got to know how to enjoy yourself in a high-pressure job, and he does.\"\n\nAndrew Tangel and Doug Cameron contributed to this article.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This significant leadership change aims to steer the aerospace giant through critical challenges and strategic opportunities. Ortberg, a seasoned executive with extensive experience in the aerospace and defense sectors, was named CEO by the Boeing Board on July 31, 2024. He begins his role today with a commitment to restoring trust and driving excellence across the company.\n\nKelly Ortberg began his tenure with a heartfelt and motivational message to Boeing employees, highlighting his commitment to restoring trust and emphasizing the importance of teamwork. \"Restoring trust starts with meeting our commitments -- whether that's building high-quality, safe commercial aircraft, delivering on defense and space products, or servicing our products to keep our customers running 24/7,\" Ortberg wrote. \"It also means meeting our commitments to each other and working collaboratively across Boeing to meet our goals.\"\n\nOrtberg's emphasis on quality and safety is a direct response to the issues Boeing has faced in recent years. The company has been under intense scrutiny due to production delays and safety concerns, particularly surrounding the 737 MAX. \"People's lives depend on what we do every day, and we must keep that top of mind with every decision we make,\" Ortberg stressed, underscoring the critical nature of their work.\n\nIn his message, Ortberg also shared his plans to be hands-on and visible within the company. \"Because what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company. I plan to be based in Seattle so that I can be close to the commercial airplane programs,\" he stated. This approach is reminiscent of Ortberg's tenure at Rockwell Collins, where he was known for removing VIP parking spots to promote equality and often parking far from the building himself to set an example. Brad Neilly, a former employee, recalled how Ortberg's actions made a big impact on him and other employees.\n\nOrtberg's message also highlighted his intention to engage directly with employees and stakeholders. \"In fact, I'll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome, while also reviewing our safety and quality plans. Soon I'll be visiting many of our sites and I look forward to meeting with teammates around the world,\" he said. This commitment to being present and involved is expected to foster a stronger connection between leadership and the workforce, a critical step in addressing the cultural and operational issues that have plagued Boeing.\n\nThe new CEO's approach has already garnered positive reactions from within the company. \"Ortberg's willingness to be on the ground and listen to employees is exactly what Boeing needs right now,\" said an anonymous Boeing employee on X (formerly Twitter). \"It's a sign that he's serious about making real changes and addressing the issues we've been facing head-on.\"\n\nOrtberg concluded his message with a pledge for transparency and regular communication. \"I will be transparent with you every step of the way, sharing news on progress as well as where we must do things better. You'll begin to see routine reports from me through email and our BNN channel, giving you timely updates of what I'm seeing and hearing on the ground from our teammates and our stakeholders.\" This promise of open communication is seen as a crucial element in rebuilding trust and fostering a collaborative environment within Boeing .\n\nKelly Ortberg's appointment as Boeing's CEO is seen as a strategic move to steer the company through a period of significant turbulence. Known for his hands-on approach, Ortberg is expected to bring much-needed stability and a renewed focus on quality and safety. His tenure at Rockwell Collins demonstrated his ability to address both strategic and operational challenges effectively, a trait that Boeing desperately needs as it navigates its current crises.\n\nOrtberg's reputation for being on the factory floor and engaging directly with employees has already started to instill confidence within Boeing. \"Kelly is a person who will do that,\" said Don Beall, former CEO of Rockwell International. \"He's a very hands-on guy. He'll get out on the shop floor.\" This approach is crucial for Boeing, as it has faced significant issues with production delays and quality control that have tarnished its reputation and strained its finances.\n\nHis immediate predecessor, David Calhoun, also emphasized Ortberg's suitability for the role. \"Kelly's leadership style and industry expertise make him uniquely qualified to lead Boeing during this critical time,\" Calhoun stated. Ortberg's focus on building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies aligns with the needs of Boeing as it seeks to restore its standing in the aerospace industry.\n\nOrtberg's background in engineering and deep understanding of aerospace manufacturing processes position him well to address the intricate challenges Boeing faces. Alan Mulally, former head of Boeing's commercial business, highlighted Ortberg's experience: \"Kelly was key in developing the cockpit for the 777 and 787 jetliners -- from flight control to vision systems to maps. This required him to navigate the needs of Boeing, suppliers, pilots, regulators, and air traffic officials.\"\n\nMoreover, Ortberg's commitment to a hands-on leadership style extends beyond his interactions with employees. His strategic vision includes leveraging his deep industry relationships to rebuild trust with customers and regulators. \"In speaking with our customers and industry partners leading up to today, I can tell you that without exception, everyone wants us to succeed. In many cases, they need us to succeed,\" Ortberg emphasized in his message to employees. This network of support is critical as Boeing works to overcome its current challenges and position itself for future success.\n\nIndustry analysts have also noted Ortberg's potential to bring about meaningful change at Boeing. \"You couldn't ask for a better selection,\" aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia told Flightglobal. \"His experience and leadership style are exactly what Boeing needs to navigate through these troubled times and emerge stronger.\"\n\nOrtberg's early decisions, such as choosing to base himself in Seattle to be closer to the production lines, signal his commitment to understanding and addressing the company's core issues firsthand. This decision is seen as a move to bridge the gap between Boeing's leadership and its manufacturing workforce, fostering a culture of collaboration and accountability.\n\nKelly Ortberg's hands-on leadership and deep industry expertise are critical assets in Boeing's effort to navigate its current challenges and rebuild its reputation as an industry leader. His approach is expected to drive the company towards a more stable and prosperous future, focusing on quality, safety, and operational excellence.\n\nKelly Ortberg's strategic vision for Boeing is rooted in his commitment to restoring the company's reputation for quality and safety. His message to employees underscored the importance of these values, emphasizing that Boeing's success hinges on its ability to deliver high-quality, safe products. \"Restoring trust starts with meeting our commitments -- whether that's building high-quality, safe commercial aircraft, delivering on defense and space products, or servicing our products to keep our customers running 24/7,\" Ortberg wrote.\n\nOrtberg's strategic vision also includes a renewed focus on collaboration and transparency. He has pledged to keep employees informed through regular updates, sharing progress and improvement areas. \"I will be transparent with you every step of the way, sharing news on progress as well as where we must do things better,\" he stated. This approach is expected to foster a culture of accountability and continuous improvement, which is crucial for Boeing as it addresses its current challenges.\n\nIn addition to improving internal processes, Ortberg is focused on strengthening relationships with customers and industry partners. \"In speaking with our customers and industry partners leading up to today, I can tell you that everyone wants us to succeed without exception. In many cases, they need us to succeed,\" he emphasized. This support network is critical as Boeing works to overcome its current issues and rebuild trust within the industry.\n\nOrtberg's commitment to quality is further demonstrated by his decision to be based in Seattle, close to the commercial airplane programs. \"I plan to be based in Seattle near the commercial airplane programs. I'll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome,\" he mentioned in his message. This hands-on approach is expected to help identify and resolve production issues more effectively, ensuring that Boeing's products meet the highest quality and safety standards.\n\nFormer colleagues and industry analysts have praised Ortberg's focus on quality and strategic vision. \"Kelly is not the kind of person to shoot from the hip. He's deliberate and thorough, which is exactly what Boeing needs right now,\" said Andrew Policano, a former business-school dean who worked closely with Ortberg at Rockwell Collins. Aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia echoed this sentiment, stating, \"His experience and leadership style are exactly what Boeing needs to navigate through these troubled times and emerge stronger.\"\n\nBy prioritizing quality, transparency, and collaboration, Ortberg aims to steer Boeing towards a more stable and prosperous future. His strategic vision and hands-on leadership are expected to drive meaningful change within the company, restoring its reputation as a leader in the aerospace industry.\n\nKelly Ortberg's appointment as Boeing's CEO comes at a time when the company faces significant cultural and operational challenges. One of the most pressing issues is Boeing's internal culture, which has been described as overly focused on production at the expense of quality and safety. This \"push, push, push, go, go, go\" mentality has been identified as a contributing factor to the company's recent problems, including the two fatal 737 MAX crashes. Ortberg acknowledges these challenges and is determined to address them head-on.\n\n\"Our culture must evolve to prioritize safety and quality above all else,\" Ortberg wrote in his message to employees. \"We must create an environment where employees feel empowered to speak up about potential issues without fear of retribution.\" This commitment to fostering an open and transparent culture is seen as a crucial step in rebuilding trust both within the company and with external stakeholders.\n\nTo facilitate this cultural shift, Ortberg plans to spend significant time on the factory floors, engaging directly with employees. \"I'll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome, while also reviewing our safety and quality plans,\" he stated. This approach is reminiscent of his time at Rockwell Collins, where he was known for his hands-on leadership style and for being deeply involved in the day-to-day operations.\n\nFormer colleagues have expressed confidence in Ortberg's ability to transform Boeing's culture. \"Kelly is a very hands-on guy. He'll get out on the shop floor and work directly with employees to understand their challenges and find solutions,\" said Don Beall, former CEO of Rockwell International. This leadership style is expected to help bridge the gap between management and the workforce, fostering a more collaborative and supportive environment.\n\nIn addition to cultural changes, Ortberg is also focused on operational improvements. Boeing has been grappling with production delays, quality lapses, and increased scrutiny from regulators. \"We need to get back to basics,\" Ortberg emphasized. \"This means ensuring that our production processes are efficient and that our products meet the highest standards of quality and safety.\" He has already begun reviewing the company's safety and quality plans, with a particular focus on addressing the issues that have led to recent production mishaps.\n\nIndustry experts believe that Ortberg's experience and approach will be instrumental in driving these operational improvements. \"Kelly's deep understanding of the aerospace industry and his commitment to quality make him well-suited to tackle Boeing's current challenges,\" said Alan Mulally, former head of Boeing's commercial business. By focusing on both cultural and operational changes, Ortberg aims to steer Boeing through its current crisis and set the company on a path to long-term success.\n\nOverall, Kelly Ortberg's comprehensive strategy to address Boeing's cultural and operational challenges reflects his commitment to restoring the company's reputation and ensuring its future stability. With his hands-on leadership and focus on transparency, safety, and quality, Ortberg is poised to lead Boeing through this critical period in its history.\n\nKelly Ortberg's leadership at Boeing is set to have a significant impact on the company's unionized workforce. Boeing's labor relations have been strained in recent years, particularly with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which represents a large portion of the company's employees. The union has raised concerns about job security, working conditions, and the company's approach to production and safety standards.\n\nOrtberg's message to employees highlighted his commitment to improving these relations. \"I plan to engage directly with our union representatives to ensure that we are addressing their concerns and working collaboratively towards our common goals,\" Ortberg wrote. This direct engagement is seen as a positive step towards rebuilding trust and fostering a more cooperative relationship between Boeing's management and its workforce.\n\nUnion leaders have expressed cautious optimism about Ortberg's appointment. \"We are hopeful that Kelly Ortberg's hands-on approach and his focus on safety and quality will lead to meaningful improvements in our working conditions,\" said John Holden, President of IAM District 751. \"We look forward to working with him to address the issues that have been affecting our members.\"\n\nOne of the immediate challenges Ortberg faces is addressing the potential for a strike by IAM members. The union has been vocal about its demands for better job security and a commitment from Boeing to maintain production in the Seattle area. \"Our members are prepared to take action if necessary, but we are optimistic that we can reach an agreement with the new leadership,\" Holden added.\n\nOrtberg's decision to be based in Seattle and his plans to spend significant time on the factory floors have been well received by the union. \"Having the CEO close to the production lines and understanding our day-to-day challenges is crucial,\" said Mike Mulligan, a machinist at Boeing's Renton facility. \"It shows that he is serious about addressing our concerns and making improvements.\"\n\nThe impact of Ortberg's leadership on Boeing's workforce extends beyond the unionized employees. His focus on transparency and open communication is expected to foster a more inclusive and supportive workplace culture. \"I will be transparent with you every step of the way, sharing news on progress as well as where we must do things better,\" Ortberg promised in his message to employees. This commitment to transparency is aimed at building trust and ensuring that all employees feel valued and heard.\n\nKelly Ortberg's approach to labor relations and workforce engagement is set to play a crucial role in Boeing's turnaround. By prioritizing direct engagement with union representatives, addressing key concerns, and fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration, Ortberg aims to rebuild trust and create a more positive working environment for all Boeing employees.\n\nThe appointment of Kelly Ortberg as Boeing's new CEO has had a notable impact on the company's financial outlook and the market's response. Ortberg's reputation as a strategic thinker with a hands-on approach has instilled confidence among investors and industry analysts alike. As Boeing navigates through its turbulent times, Ortberg's leadership is seen as a potential catalyst for the company's recovery.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the announcement on July 31, 2024, Boeing's stock saw a modest uptick. Market analysts attribute this rise to Ortberg's track record at Rockwell Collins, where he successfully led the company through significant growth and transformation. \"Ortberg's experience in turning around Rockwell Collins makes him an ideal candidate to steer Boeing through its current challenges,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Teal Group. \"Investors are cautiously optimistic about his ability to replicate that success at Boeing.\"\n\nFinancial experts are closely monitoring Ortberg's strategy to address Boeing's ongoing issues, including production delays and quality control problems. \"Boeing's financial performance has been underwhelming, with substantial operating losses in recent quarters,\" noted Sheila Kahyaoglu, an aerospace and defense analyst at Jefferies. \"However, Ortberg's commitment to quality and operational efficiency could help reverse this trend.\"\n\nIn his initial message to Boeing employees, Ortberg emphasized the importance of meeting commitments and restoring trust. \"Restoring trust starts with meeting our commitments,\" Ortberg wrote. \"Whether that's building high-quality, safe commercial aircraft or delivering on defense and space products, our success depends on our ability to deliver what we promise.\" This focus on reliability and customer satisfaction is expected to resonate well with Boeing's clients and stakeholders, potentially leading to improved financial performance in the coming quarters.\n\nThe market response has been tempered by the acknowledgment of the significant challenges ahead. Boeing's recent financial results have highlighted the depth of the company's issues, with an operating loss of $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024. \"The financial recovery of Boeing will be a marathon, not a sprint,\" said Peter Arment, an analyst at Baird. \"Ortberg's leadership is a positive step, but it will take time for the company to regain its footing and achieve sustainable profitability.\"\n\nOrtberg's decision to relocate to Seattle and focus on the commercial airplane programs is also seen as a strategic move to be closer to Boeing's core operations. \"Being based in Seattle allows Ortberg to have a direct line of sight into the production challenges and to engage with the workforce more effectively,\" said Ron Epstein, an aerospace analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"This hands-on approach is crucial for addressing the issues that have plagued Boeing's production lines.\"\n\nWhile the road to recovery for Boeing is fraught with challenges, the appointment of Kelly Ortberg as CEO has injected a sense of cautious optimism among investors and industry stakeholders. His focus on transparency, quality, and operational efficiency, coupled with his hands-on leadership style, is expected to drive positive changes within the company. \"We have what it takes to win, and I'm committed to working with you to focus the company in a way that makes us all proud to be a part of Boeing,\" Ortberg stated in his message to employees. As Boeing embarks on this new chapter under Ortberg's leadership, the market will be watching closely to see how his strategies unfold and impact the company's financial trajectory.", "source":

Meanwhile, Boeing shares are down some 37% so far this year, as of Wednesday.\n\nOrtberg's Day 1 activity is walking the floor of Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington, where it builds its best-selling but problematic 737 Max. He plans to talk with employees and review safety and quality plans, with similar visits ahead at other Boeing plants.\n\n\"I can't tell you how proud and excited I am to be a member of the Boeing team,\" he said in a note to staff on Thursday. \"While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I'm confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect.\"\n\nAnalysts and industry insiders are cautiously upbeat, painting the 64-year-old Ortberg -- a more than three-decade veteran of the industry who spent years atop commercial and defense supplier Rockwell Collins after working up the ranks there -- as a good listener with an engineering background (he has a mechanical engineering degree). Perhaps most importantly, he is a Boeing outsider.\n\n\"This guy has a fantastic reputation and level of experience in the industry,\" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \"He has a reputation for listening and for letting people push back.\"\n\nThose skills will be key as Boeing tries to stabilize its production and eliminate manufacturing flaws.\n\nBoeing's top safety executive for commercial aerospace told a National Transportation Safety Board hearing earlier this week that the company is working on a design fix so the near-catastrophic door plug blowout it faced at the beginning of the year never happens again.\n\nThe hearing was part of the NTSB's probe of the the midair blowout of a door plug from a packed, months-old Boeing 737 Max 9 as it climbed out of Oregon. While no one was seriously injured in the accident, it put Boeing back into crisis mode just as it was trying to move on from two fatal crashes of its best-selling 737 Max planes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nWorker testimony at the NTSB hearing also showed manufacturing pressure and frequent fixes on planes, putting a spotlight on Boeing's factories.\n\n\"I will be transparent with you every step of the way, sharing news on progress as well as where we must do things better,\" Ortberg said in the memo. He vowed to share reports to staff, \"giving you timely updates of what I'm seeing and hearing on the ground from our teammates and our stakeholders.\"\n\nBoeing last month agreed to plead guilty to defrauding the U.S. government during the Max certification, a deal that will require an independent corporate monitor at the company for three years.\n\nBut Ortberg will have to address issues not only in the commercial jet business, including the delayed certification of new 737 and 777 models, but also in its defense unit.\n\nThat segment of the business is facing issues with two 747s that will serve as the next Air Force One aircraft but are years behind schedule. Meanwhile, Boeing's misfiring Starliner capsule, which launched in early June, has NASA debating whether to use SpaceX instead to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back from the International Space Station.\n\nA decision is also looming over whether to launch a new aircraft as Boeing loses ground to rival Airbus.\n\nThe first 100 days of Ortberg's time as CEO will be crucial, said Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein.\n\n\"The decisions made early in his tenure will have generational impacts on the company,\" he said in a note on Monday.\n\nOrtberg and his team will need to ensure Boeing's workforce is trained, with thousands of new workers in factories after more experienced staff members took buyouts or were laid off in the pandemic. A union representing some 30,000 Boeing factory workers in Washington state and Oregon is seeking more than 40% raises and, last month, members authorized a strike if a deal isn't reached this September.\n\n\"The principles of safety and quality should be equally important as the manufacturing rates,\" Jon Holden, local president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said in a statement last week. \"This potential collaboration with the new CEO could be a prime opportunity for Boeing to prove its dedication to its workforce and acknowledge the exceptional manufacturing capability and capacity of skilled IAM Members on the shop floor.\"\n\nLast week, alongside another quarterly loss, Boeing announced Ortberg would replace Dave Calhoun, who had said in March he would step down by year's end.\n\nThat was part of a larger executive shakeup after the door plug blowout. Calhoun himself took over a Boeing in crisis in early 2020, replacing Dennis Muilenburg, who was ousted for his handling of the two Max crashes.\n\nWhile Boeing is still based in Arlington, Virginia -- where it announced it would move its headquarters in 2022 from Chicago -- Ortberg will be based in the Seattle area, giving him a close eye on where the majority of Boeing's commercial jetliner production is based.\n\n\"In speaking with our customers and industry partners leading up to today, I can tell you that without exception, everyone wants us to succeed,\" Otberg said in his Day 1 note to employees. \"In many cases, they NEED us to succeed. This is a great foundation for us to build upon.\"\n\nGetting off on the right foot with customers and the hundreds of suppliers that are struggling from pandemic-demand whiplash is important for Ortberg and the company. Boeing's relationships with its bread-and-butter customers has suffered recently, and its leadership shakeup came after airline CEOs sought a meeting with the company's board as delays of aircraft piled up in the wake of the doorplug blowout.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is among Boeing's biggest customers and, like other carriers, has scaled back its growth plans, citing delivery delays of new, more-fuel efficient jets from Boeing. The airline's CEO hinted at the big feat Ortberg has ahead of him.\n\n\"We look forward to working with Kelly Ortberg in his efforts to return Boeing to its place as the leading American aerospace company,\" CEO Bob Jordan said in a written statement. \"A strong Boeing is great for Southwest Airlines and it's great for our industry.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news",

The board's investigators have interviewed workers at the 737 factory in Renton, Washington, who say they are under too much pressure to produce planes quickly, leading to mistakes.\n\nDuring the hearing, a Federal Aviation Administration manager said the regulator has 16 open enforcement cases against Boeing -- three or four times the normal number -- and half started since the door-plug blowout.\n\nOrtberg will try to fix Boeing after the last two CEOs failed.\n\nDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing lifer, was fired in 2020 when the company was trying to convince regulators to let Max jetliners resume flying after crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.

The new CEO is planting a symbolic flag in the ground back in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\"Because what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company,\" Ortberg told employees. \"I plan to be based in Seattle so that I can be close to the commercial airplane programs. In fact, I'll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome, while also reviewing our safety and quality plans.\"\n\nThe company declined to make Ortberg available for interviews.\n\nOrtberg's name emerged relatively late in the CEO search. Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf, who led the search, said Ortberg has a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\n\nAnalysts have generally been favorable too. Richard Aboulafia, a longtime analyst and consultant in the industry, said Ortberg is deeply respected \"and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades.\"\n\nOne of Ortberg's top assignments will be fixing the manufacturing process and increasing production of Max jets, Boeing's best-selling plane. The FAA has limited Boeing to 38 per month since shortly after the Alaska Airlines blowout, but Boeing's top safety official said this week production isn't even that high - it's in the 20s per month.\n\nCalhoun did finish one job before Ortberg took over: the company reached an agreement with the Justice Department last month to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will decide whether to approve the deal, which includes a fine of at least $244 million Boeing investing at least $455 million in quality- and safety-compliance programs.\n\nBoeing's defense and space unit is also struggling. It lost $913 million in the second quarter because of setbacks on fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Known for his extensive experience in the aerospace industry, Ortberg has built a notable career, including his previous role as CEO of Rockwell Collins. Now, people want to know more about how he amassed his wealth over the years.\n\nHere is everything to know about Kelly Ortberg's net worth in 2024.\n\nKelly Ortberg's net worth in 2024 consists of earnings from his previous leadership at Rockwell Collins.\n\nWhat does Kelly Ortberg do for a living?\n\nKelly Ortberg was the CEO of Rockwell Collins and a business executive.\n\nBoeing has appointed Robert \"Kelly\" Ortberg as its new CEO and president, tasked with addressing the company's recent challenges, including safety controversies and production hurdles. At 64, Ortberg, who led Rockwell Collins as CEO, will begin his new role on August 8. He will replace Dave Calhoun, who is retiring at the end of the year but will stay on as a special adviser to the board until March.\n\nKelly Ortberg's earnings explained -- how do they make money?\n\nKelly Ortberg earns money from various professional pursuits.\n\nOrtberg's career highlights his exceptional leadership and industry expertise. Starting at Rockwell Collins in 1987, Ortberg advanced from program manager to executive vice president, overseeing key systems for Boeing and Airbus jets and military avionics. He became CEO in 2013, guiding the company until 2018. Under his leadership, Rockwell Collins' sales grew to $9 billion, thanks in part to acquisitions like Arinc. In 2019, United Technologies bought Rockwell Collins for $23 billion, integrating it into Collins Aerospace, which became the third-largest aerospace firm globally.\n\nFollowing this, United Technologies merged with Raytheon to form RTX in an $86 billion deal, reducing Collins' role. Ortberg, initially a leading candidate for CEO, left Collins Aerospace in early 2020 after a brief tenure. In 2021, he left his position at RTX but continued to serve as a director on RTX's board.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "disheeta_maheshwari@comingsoon.net", "name": "Disheeta Maheshwari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon_Technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raytheon Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Aerospace", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collins Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avionics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition between Airbus and Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/MixCollage-07-Aug-2024-01-45-PM-4416.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798890", "eventUri": "eng-9798890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 911, "textEnd": 919}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He's already winning praise - for his work location.\n\nOrtberg has decided he will work out of Boeing's offices in Seattle, which had been the company's home for its first 85 years before it moved its corporate headquarters to Chicago in 2001.\n\nThe new CEO said in a memo to staff Thursday that he decided to work 2,300 miles from the company's current corporate offices in Arlington, Virginia, to help restore trust in the company's commercial aircraft business.\n\n\"Because what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company,\" Ortberg said in the letter. \"I plan to be based in Seattle so that I can be close to the commercial airplane programs.\"\n\nOrtberg said he'd be on the factory floor in Renton, Washington, Thursday, where the company makes its troubled 737 Max line of planes.\n\nBoeing critics say moving headquarters away from its factories in the Puget Sound area more than 20 years ago underscored the company's focus on financial results instead of production processes.\n\nBut Boeing has been plagued by serious quality issues in recent years, problems that resulted in two fatal crashes, deep losses and terrifying incidents, including a door plug that blew off the fuselage on a January 5 Boeing 737 Max flight operated by Alaska Airlines.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory and a long-time critic of Boeing management, praised Ortberg's choice of office location.\n\n\"It's incredibly promising,\" he said. \"It shows that he's not afraid to go where the problem are and to put in some serious hard work solving them. The other great virtue of showing up is that you get an accurate picture of the situation, rather than news filtered through what people think you want to hear. He continues to look like the exact opposite kind of leader than the ones that plagued Boeing.\"\n\nBoeing previously insisted that moving headquarters was in the company's best interests, noting Boeing builds products other than commercial aircraft, including from its defense and space business. And the executives in charge of commercial airplanes have always been based in Seattle, even if the corporate headquarters was elsewhere.\n\nThe company said it had no comment whether it is considering moving its entire headquarters back to Seattle along with Ortberg.\n\nOrtberg will have his hands full, no matter where his office is located. The company has had almost nothing but problems for more than five years. A design flaw in its best selling 737 Max resulted in fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, followed by a 20-month grounding of the jet. That in turn kicked off years of financial losses that topped $33 billion in core operating losses in the most recent quarter.\n\nIn January a door plug blew off the side of an Alaska Airlines flight as it approached 16,000 feet, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane and bringing new attention to its production problems. Since that time it has agreed to plead guilty to deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration, a plea that will require it to work under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nIt faces a series of other federal probes, including one by the National Transportation Safety Board, which just concluded two days of public hearings on the Alaska Air incident. Boeing executives admitted there they still don't know how the plane in the door plug blowout left Boeing's Renton, Washington factory without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.\n\n\"We don't know and neither do they, and that's a problem,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters during the hearing.\n\nOrtberg, in his letter, acknowledged Boeing needs to do better.\n\n\"While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I'm confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Ortberg's tasks include mending relationships with employees, boosting output, securing labor deals, and fixing finances. He aims to be based in Seattle and will regularly visit key locations and suppliers.\n\nKelly Ortberg, Boeing's new CEO, is stepping into his role with a focus on restoring trust and increasing production efficiency. According to an internal message obtained by Reuters, Ortberg plans to be more present on the production lines, including a visit to Seattle's commercial airplane programs.\n\nOrtberg, previously the head of Rockwell Collins, has a daunting task ahead as Boeing faces significant financial strain and operational issues. His goals include improving relationships with employees and airlines, boosting production rates, and securing a labor deal to prevent a potential strike.

Two decades of leadership missteps at the company have been well documented, but Bank of America senior analyst Ronald Epstein said Boeing's credibility issues also taint how investors view its financials.\n\n\"They've been saying -- quarter after quarter after quarter -- a certain narrative, and it just hasn't played out,\" Epstein told Fortune, expanding upon his note on Boeing titled, \"A bad quarter, and by no means was this the kitchen sink.\"\n\nBoeing shares still jumped last Wednesday after the company confirmed Ortberg's appointment, closing above the $190 mark. They've since dropped 12% to open at $167 on Wednesday, however. The stock is down 35% year to date and has fallen 62% from its all-time high of $440.62 in March 2019.\n\nThat's put Boeing among the ten worst performing stocks in the S&P 500, though Epstein said it would likely be worse if Boeing didn't benefit from a global duopoly for large commercial airplanes with Airbus. But fixed-income investors are still jittery, he said, about the possibility the company's bonds could be downgraded from low-investment grade to junk.\n\nThat's because the company is burning significant cash -- $4.3 billion during the last quarter and likely $9-10 billion for the year. That doesn't include the approximately $4 billion in debt Boeing will absorb by acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselage, or main body, of Boeing's aircrafts.\n\n\"It's one of the few names I cover now where investors are as focused on the balance sheet as they are on the income statement,\" Epstein said of Boeing, \"because they have so much debt.\"\n\nTo right the ship, Boeing found the outsider it wanted in Ortberg, who led Rockwell Collins from 2013-19 as the company doubled its sales and became the third-largest aerospace company in the world. Epstein agreed hiring an outsider was the right move, saying Ortberg would be able to cast a wider net for talent than a Boeing insider and could draw upon the experience of fostering a renowned culture at Rockwell Collins.\n\n\"But it's not going to happen overnight,\" Epstein said.\n\nInvestors hope a culture shift will translate to better results. Boeing's Q2 revenue missed expectations and fell below $17 billion, down 15% from the same quarter last year. Revenue from the commercial airplane business dropped 32% as Boeing delivered just 92 planes over the three months, compared to 136 in the same period last year.\n\nThe decline in deliveries, Epstein noted, had nothing to do with the cap the Federal Aviation Administration imposed on 737 Max production after a panel on one of the planes blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.\n\n\"They made the decision, basically, to slow everything down to try to fix everything before they sped it back up,\" Epstein said. \"That's probably the right decision, but that takes time.\"\n\nBoeing's defense and space business is also struggling -- and not just because two NASA astronauts remain on the International Space Station due to issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule. The company took $1 billion in losses on certain fixed-price development programs for which they underbid, most notably a $391 million loss on production of the KC-46A, an Air Force oil tanker.\n\n\"The margins on those programs have been really, really bad,\" Epstein said.\n\nAs global defense spending increases, Boeing's results pale in comparison to those of their peers. General Dynamics and Northrup Grumman, for example, reported that earnings per share increased by 21% and 19% last quarter, respectively.\n\n\"All those guys are going gangbusters right now,\" Epstein said, highlighting just how much work Ortberg has ahead of him.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_mckenna@fortune.com", "name": "Greg McKenna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_KC-46_Pegasus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing KC-46 Pegasus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grumman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil tanker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-609573622_486a2a-e1722612648353.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798890", "eventUri": "eng-9798890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textStart": 822, "textEnd": 832}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The investment firm lowered its target price for Boeing to $207 from $222, citing concerns about the company's cash flow, defense program losses, and the challenges faced by incoming CEO Kelly Ortberg.\n\nCEO transition amidst challenges\n\nOn July 31, Boeing reported its Q2 earnings, but the results took a backseat to the announcement of Kelly Ortberg as the new CEO, effective August 8, 2024.\n\nOrtberg, who previously led Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) and Collins Aerospace, faces an uphill battle. Despite his successful track record, Boeing's scale and the complexity of its commercial and defense operations present a much more formidable challenge.\n\nBernstein analysts noted the difficulties an outsider might face at Boeing, pointing out that the lack of internal knowledge and personal networks could hinder the effectiveness in addressing the company's significant issues.\n\nFinancial struggles and cash flow concerns\n\nBoeing's financial situation remains precarious. The company is grappling with increasing defense charges, rising inventories, and a high debt load. Free cash flow (FCF) has been severely impacted, with Bernstein now projecting that Boeing will not achieve $10 billion in FCF until 2028, a significant delay from previous estimates.\n\nConcerns about a possible equity raise have also been voiced by investors. \"While possible, we are not convinced this is necessary,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe brokerage does expect Boeing's cash balance to hit a low of $9.4 billion in the third-quarter before improving as production ramps up.\n\nHowever, substantial debt repayments will likely limit near-term dividends and buybacks, adding to investor apprehensions.\n\nProduction ramp and delivery delays\n\nDespite some positive developments in production, Boeing faces substantial delays in key programs:\n\n737MAX: Production is on track to reach a rate of 38 per month by year-end, with an expected 100 deliveries in the fourth quarter, up from an earlier estimate of 90. The restart of deliveries to China and Air India is a positive sign, but challenges remain, particularly with the certification delays for the 737-7 and 737-10 models.\n\n787: Production remains below the target rate of 5 per month, with only 9 deliveries in the second quarter compared to 13 in the first quarter. Supply chain constraints and additional inspections have hindered progress. Bernstein has adjusted its third quarter delivery expectations down to 19 from 29.\n\n777X: Certification is progressing, with Boeing obtaining Type Inspection Authorization. However, first deliveries are not expected until 2025, with production currently at one per month.\n\nDefense sector performance has been a significant drag, with Boeing reporting another $1 billion in losses from fixed-price development programs in the second quarter. This ongoing issue has consistently disappointed investors and analysts alike.\n\nThe downgrade by Bernstein, coupled with an 8.4% drop in Boeing's stock since the earnings report, reflects the market's concerns about the company's future.\n\nDespite maintaining an \"Outperform\" rating, Bernstein's reduced target price underscores the cautious optimism surrounding Boeing's recovery.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Aerospace", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collins Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777X", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 777X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_certificate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Type certificate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Armored_Car_Service", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Armored Car Service", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEF2G0QA_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798890", "eventUri": "eng-9798890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 363, "textEnd": 370}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Ortberg will focus on mending relationships with employees and suppliers, and ensuring high safety standards.\n\nOn Thursday, Boeing's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, will meet with U.S. workers manufacturing the company's highly-sought 737 MAX jet. He aims to be closer to production lines as he tackles the immense challenge of restoring trust, as outlined in a message to employees. The former Rockwell Collins CEO will focus on close interaction with workers, suppliers, government officials, and regulators from day one as Boeing's new head, facing years of problems and financial losses.\n\nOrtberg, who is 64, plans to stay based in Seattle to be near key Boeing commercial airplane programs, including the MAX produced in nearby Renton, Washington. The output of the MAX jets has slowed since a mid-air panel blowout incident on January 5, sparking a safety crisis. In his letter, Ortberg emphasized the importance of being closer to the production lines and development programs across Boeing. He expressed his intention to be on the factory floor in Renton, discussing challenges directly with employees.\n\nAmong Ortberg's priorities are rebuilding relationships with airlines and employees, ramping up the production rate of the MAX jets from 25 to 38 planes a month by year-end, and securing a labor deal to prevent a potential strike this year. The National Transportation Safety Board head criticized Boeing for ignoring repeated warnings which led to the Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 emergency, labeling it an avoidable incident. Ortberg's agenda includes a visit next week to Boeing's key supplier Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, following Boeing's agreement last month to buy back Spirit Aero for $4.7 billion in stock.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Fleet_Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Fleet Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_36_44_9180289.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798890", "eventUri": "eng-9798890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 1013, "textEnd": 1022}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Boeing is currently producing about 25 MAX jets a month, with a target of 38 per month by year-end.\n\n\"Because what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company,\" he wrote in the letter. \"In fact, I'll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome.\"\n\nOrtberg also plans to visit employees at Boeing's key supplier Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) in Wichita, Kansas, next week, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Last month Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit Aero, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for $4.7 billion in stock.\n\n\"Soon I'll be visiting many of our sites and I look forward to meeting with teammates around the world,\" the letter said.\n\n\"Restoring trust starts with meeting our commitments -- whether that's building high quality, safe commercial aircraft, delivering on defense and space products that allow our customers to meet their mission,\" Ortberg added in the note.\n\n\"People's lives depend on what we do every day, and we must keep that top of mind with every decision we make.\"", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPEK770IW_M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798890", "eventUri": "eng-9798890", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 851, "textEnd": 857}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said he'll walk the main factory floor near Seattle on his first day and relocate to the city that forms the nucleus of the planemaker's activities to renew the bond with workers stung by crisis.\n\n\"While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I'm confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect,\" Ortberg said in a memo sent to Boeing employees on his first day in the new position. \"I will be transparent with you every step of the way, sharing news on progress as well as where we must do things better.\"\n\nOrtberg's commitment to Seattle carries both practical and symbolic weight. His predecessor, Dave Calhoun, preferred to work on the go from a corporate jet or his homes in New Hampshire or South Carolina, and Boeing has moved its corporate headquarters first to Chicago and more recently to Arlington, Virginia.\n\nThat geographic separation between operations and manufacturing was increasingly called into question in the wake of the Jan. 5 accident aboard an almost-new 737 Max 9 aircraft that resulted from clumsy workmanship on the final assembly line. Calhoun announced in March that he'd leave, part of a major shakeup of management and production processes as Boeing tries to dig itself out of the crisis that's consumed the company for seven months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrtberg, 64, is an engineer by training who rose through the ranks at Rockwell Collins, an aviation supplier that's now part of RTX Corp. He's taking over with a mandate to fix Boeing's reputation, manufacturing and finances. The company burned through $4.33 billion in cash during the second quarter. That's after a similar outflow in the first three months, as Boeing slowed down output of its commercial jet factories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company,\" the new CEO said in his memo to employees. He also struck an optimistic note, saying that \"everyone wants us to succeed. In many cases, they NEED us to succeed. This is a great foundation for us to build upon.\"\n\nAviation News\n\nStay prepared.

Worker representatives criticized Boeing's manufacturing processes as needlessly complex and difficult to follow. Boeing has said it's made strides to address quality lapses at its factories, including by simplifying instructions for workers.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said that the company should brace for more surprise audits and inspections as safety inspectors seek to assess progress on the shop floor. Since the Jan. 5 accident, Boeing has been subject to whistleblower accounts recounting years of unauthorized work and defects that allege the company prioritized production targets and financial goals over diligence and sound workmanship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrtberg will work closely with Stephanie Pope, who was selected in the March management shakeup to lead Boeing's commercial aircraft business. Pope also spends most of her time in the Seattle area, another sign that the company's power center is shifting back to the original home where Boeing was founded more than 100 years ago.\n\nBenedikt Kammel for Bloomberg\n\nRelated StoriesRead MoreElliott discloses 7% voting stake in Southwest as it edges closer to forcing meetingElliott Investment Management, the activist investor that has tried to shake up Southwest Airlines has disclosed a 7% beneficial ownership.First Southwest Airlines joined Google Flights.

MAX's production has slowed following a Jan. 5 mid-air panel blowout on a near-new model that triggered a safety crisis.\n\n\"Because what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company,\" he wrote in the letter. \"In fact, I\u00b4ll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome.\"\n\nOrtberg's to-do list includes mending relationships with airlines and employees, boosting output of MAX jets from about 25 to 38 planes a month by year-end and securing a labor deal to avoid a possible strike this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said the Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 emergency was entirely avoidable because Boeing had been repeatedly warned about the problem of unauthorized production.\n\nBoeing has said documentation, a critical part of aerospace manufacturing, is missing for an earlier removal of the panel that fell off the plane, which lacked four bolts.\n\nNTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said staff at the independent safety agency would like to complete a probe into the Alaska flight by early next year.\n\nOrtberg also plans to visit employees at Boeing's key supplier Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, next week, according to officials from both companies. Last month, Boeing agreed to buy back cash-strapped Spirit Aero, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for $4.7 billion in stock.\n\nU.S. Senator Jerry Moran invited Ortberg and Boeing chairman Steve Mollenkopf to Wichita next week where they will tour Spirit, a spokesperson for the Kansas Republican said.\n\nSpirit Aero spokesperson Joe Buccino said the high-profile visit would showcase the company's commercial and defense operations.\n\n\"We appreciate Senator Moran's leadership and representation for our Wichita workforce,\" Buccino said.\n\nOrtberg added in the message to employees that stakes are high for Boeing to resolve its problems.\n\n\"People\u00b4s lives depend on what we do every day, and we must keep that top of mind with every decision we make,\" he said.\n\n\"Restoring trust starts with meeting our commitments - whether that\u00b4s building high-quality, safe commercial aircraft, (or) delivering on defense and space products that allow our customers to meet their mission.\" (Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal and David Shepardson in Washington;

And for different reasons, investors in these three companies will hope that their new leaders will make a tangible difference in improving performance.\n\nWilliam Brown took over as CEO of 3M (MMM -1.65%) on May 1 and has significantly influenced investors' thoughts about the company. Kelly Ortberg will take over as CEO of Boeing (BA -1.09%) on Aug. 1, and Johnson Controls (JCI -1.41%) recently announced it's searching for a new CEO. Here's how new leaders could potentially improve these companies.\n\nBrown's presentation on the second-quarter earnings call clarified that he intends to restructure the company fundamentally. He said that 3M's organic growth had been below par for several years, and that the keys to improving it are new products driven by an increased focus on research and development (R&D) and a rigorous approach to operational improvement.\n\nIt takes time for R&D investment to come to fruition, so investors should look for near-term action on improving operations and capital deployment, and Brown's willingness to abandon assets that aren't a good fit for 3M.\n\nAmong the operational improvements, he plans to reduce 3M's supply chain complexity, implement lean manufacturing practices, improve sourcing, and drive $1 billion worth of improvement in working capital by reducing the time it takes 3M to cycle its inventory into sales.\n\nWhile much of this might sound simple, the reality is that 3M investors haven't heard it from their management in a long time. And Brown starts in a relatively favorable position to implement change. The recent dividend cut frees up cash to restructure the company and deploy capital.\n\nIn addition, the spinoff of healthcare specialist Solventum (and the retention of a 19.9% stake) gives 3M financial firepower to meet its legal settlement obligations.\n\nLastly, the restructuring actions started by the previous leadership team in 2023 are bearing fruit as 3M is improving its margin performance.\n\nAll told, Brown is in an excellent position to improve the company's growth, margins, and cash flow generation. With 3M's end markets slowly improving, the scene is set for him to enhance shareholder value.\n\n3M needs a leader with a strategic direction, but Boeing needs one with a firm handle on execution. Based on his track record, Ortberg is a good choice. Formerly CEO of Rockwell Collins, he led it into its acquisition by United Technologies to create Collins Aerospace.\n\nOrtberg then became the CEO of Collins Aerospace, after which United Technologies merged its aerospace business (including Collins Aerospace) with Raytheon Technologies to become Raytheon -- now named RTX.\n\nApologies for the word salad. Readers need to take away the key point that, as previously discussed, the Rockwell Collins acquisition and the Collins Aerospace merger significantly outperformed their initial expectations for synergy generation. In other words, their integration generated more cost savings than originally planned, and Ortberg was a large part of that.\n\nBoeing will need more of the same to squeeze operational improvements out of the business because it's currently burning cash and is highly indebted and faces potentially tricky labor negotiations. And its defense business keeps reporting losses due to problematic fixed-price development projects.\n\nThe aerospace company has a multiyear backlog, continues to win airplane orders, and has reported some better delivery rates recently.\n\nKelly Ortberg has his work cut out, but Boeing appears to be in good hands. Readers should note he will have the support of his former colleagues Dave Gitlin (ex-president of Collins Aerospace) and Akhil Johri (previously chief financial officer of United Technologies) on the Boeing board to support him.\n\nThe heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) and building solutions company operates in desirable end markets. Its products help building owners improve efficiency and reach their net zero emissions goals. And the development of new connected smart technologies is enhancing the value of its products.\n\nYet there's a problem, manifested in the following chart comparing the company's stock with its peers.\n\nSimply put, Johnson Controls does not have a good record of meeting its guidance.\n\nIt also disappointed with its sales growth in 2023 as dealers reset inventory more than planned.

And for different reasons, investors in these three companies will hope that their new leaders will make a tangible difference in improving performance.\n\nBrown's presentation on the second-quarterearnings callclarified that he intends to restructure the company fundamentally. He said that 3M's organic growth had been below par for several years, and that the keys to improving it are new products driven by an increased focus on research and development (R&D) and a rigorous approach to operational improvement.\n\nIt takes time for R&D investment to come to fruition, so investors should look for near-term action on improving operations and capital deployment, and Brown's willingness to abandon assets that aren't a good fit for 3M.\n\nAmong the operational improvements, he plans to reduce 3M's supply chain complexity, implement lean manufacturing practices, improve sourcing, and drive $1 billion worth of improvement in working capital by reducing the time it takes 3M to cycle its inventory into sales.\n\nWhile much of this might sound simple, the reality is that 3M investors haven't heard it from their management in a long time. And Brown starts in a relatively favorable position to implement change. The recent dividend cut frees up cash to restructure the company and deploy capital.\n\nIn addition, the spinoff of healthcare specialist Solventum (and the retention of a 19.9% stake) gives 3M financial firepower to meet its legal settlement obligations.\n\nLastly, the restructuring actions started by the previous leadership team in 2023 are bearing fruit as 3M is improving its margin performance.\n\nAll told, Brown is in an excellent position to improve the company's growth, margins, and cash flow generation. With 3M's end markets slowly improving, the scene is set for him to enhance shareholder value.\n\n3M needs a leader with a strategic direction, but Boeing needs one with a firm handle on execution. Based on his track record, Ortberg is a good choice. Formerly CEO of Rockwell Collins, he led it into its acquisition by United Technologies to create Collins Aerospace.\n\nOrtberg then became the CEO of Collins Aerospace, after which United Technologies merged its aerospace business (including Collins Aerospace) with Raytheon Technologies to become Raytheon -- now named RTX.\n\nApologies for the word salad. Readers need to take away the key point that, as previously discussed, the Rockwell Collins acquisition and the Collins Aerospace merger significantly outperformed their initial expectations for synergy generation. In other words, their integration generated more cost savings than originally planned, and Ortberg was a large part of that.\n\nBoeing will need more of the same to squeeze operational improvements out of the business because it's currently burning cash and is highly indebted and faces potentially tricky labor negotiations. And its defense business keeps reporting losses due to problematic fixed-price development projects.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe aerospace company has a multiyear backlog, continues to win airplane orders, and has reported some better delivery rates recently.\n\nKelly Ortberg has his work cut out, but Boeing appears to be in good hands. Readers should note he will have the support of his former colleagues Dave Gitlin (ex-president of Collins Aerospace) and Akhil Johri (previously chief financial officer of United Technologies) on the Boeing board to support him.\n\nJohnson Controls\n\nThe heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) and building solutions company operates in desirable end markets. Its products help building owners improve efficiency and reach their net zero emissions goals. And the development of new connected smart technologies is enhancing the value of its products.\n\nYet there's a problem, manifested in the following chart comparing the company's stock with its peers.\n\nJCI data by YCharts.\n\nSimply put, Johnson Controls does not have a good record of meeting its guidance.\n\nIt also disappointed with its sales growth in 2023 as dealers reset inventory more than planned. After starting 2024 forecasting mid-single-digit revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.65 to $3.80, management recently told investors organic growth would be just 3%, and adjusted EPS would be $3.66 to $3.69.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nJohnson Controls is a strong business, operating in good end markets, and the recent announcement of a deal to sell its noncore residential and light commercial HVAC business makes sense. As such, the stock has significant upside potential provided the new CEO can restore confidence in management's guidance and ability to execute on its plans.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and 3M wasn't one of them.

And for different reasons, investors in these three companies will hope that their new leaders will make a tangible difference in improving performance.\n\nWilliam Brown took over as CEO of 3M (NYSE: MMM) on May 1 and has significantly influenced investors' thoughts about the company. Kelly Ortberg will take over as CEO of Boeing (NYSE: BA) on Aug. 1, and Johnson Controls (NYSE: JCI) recently announced it's searching for a new CEO. Here's how new leaders could potentially improve these companies.\n\nBrown's presentation on the second-quarter earnings call clarified that he intends to restructure the company fundamentally. He said that 3M's organic growth had been below par for several years, and that the keys to improving it are new products driven by an increased focus on research and development (R&D) and a rigorous approach to operational improvement.\n\nIt takes time for R&D investment to come to fruition, so investors should look for near-term action on improving operations and capital deployment, and Brown's willingness to abandon assets that aren't a good fit for 3M.\n\nAmong the operational improvements, he plans to reduce 3M's supply chain complexity, implement lean manufacturing practices, improve sourcing, and drive $1 billion worth of improvement in working capital by reducing the time it takes 3M to cycle its inventory into sales.\n\nWhile much of this might sound simple, the reality is that 3M investors haven't heard it from their management in a long time. And Brown starts in a relatively favorable position to implement change. The recent dividend cut frees up cash to restructure the company and deploy capital.\n\nIn addition, the spinoff of healthcare specialist Solventum (and the retention of a 19.9% stake) gives 3M financial firepower to meet its legal settlement obligations.\n\nLastly, the restructuring actions started by the previous leadership team in 2023 are bearing fruit as 3M is improving its margin performance.\n\nAll told, Brown is in an excellent position to improve the company's growth, margins, and cash flow generation. With 3M's end markets slowly improving, the scene is set for him to enhance shareholder value.\n\n3M needs a leader with a strategic direction, but Boeing needs one with a firm handle on execution. Based on his track record, Ortberg is a good choice. Formerly CEO of Rockwell Collins, he led it into its acquisition by United Technologies to create Collins Aerospace.\n\nOrtberg then became the CEO of Collins Aerospace, after which United Technologies merged its aerospace business (including Collins Aerospace) with Raytheon Technologies to become Raytheon -- now named RTX.\n\nApologies for the word salad. Readers need to take away the key point that, as previously discussed, the Rockwell Collins acquisition and the Collins Aerospace merger significantly outperformed their initial expectations for synergy generation. In other words, their integration generated more cost savings than originally planned, and Ortberg was a large part of that.\n\nBoeing will need more of the same to squeeze operational improvements out of the business because it's currently burning cash and is highly indebted and faces potentially tricky labor negotiations. And its defense business keeps reporting losses due to problematic fixed-price development projects.\n\nThe aerospace company has a multiyear backlog, continues to win airplane orders, and has reported some better delivery rates recently.\n\nKelly Ortberg has his work cut out, but Boeing appears to be in good hands. Readers should note he will have the support of his former colleagues Dave Gitlin (ex-president of Collins Aerospace) and Akhil Johri (previously chief financial officer of United Technologies) on the Boeing board to support him.\n\nThe heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) and building solutions company operates in desirable end markets. Its products help building owners improve efficiency and reach their net zero emissions goals. And the development of new connected smart technologies is enhancing the value of its products.\n\nYet there's a problem, manifested in the following chart comparing the company's stock with its peers.\n\nSimply put, Johnson Controls does not have a good record of meeting its guidance.\n\nIt also disappointed with its sales growth in 2023 as dealers reset inventory more than planned. After starting 2024 forecasting mid-single-digit revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.65 to $3.80, management recently told investors organic growth would be just 3%, and adjusted EPS would be $3.66 to $3.69.\n\nJohnson Controls is a strong business, operating in good end markets, and the recent announcement of a deal to sell its noncore residential and light commercial HVAC business makes sense. As such, the stock has significant upside potential provided the new CEO can restore confidence in management's guidance and ability to execute on its plans.\n\nBefore you buy stock in 3M, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and 3M wasn't one of them.

While we clearly have a lot of work to do in restoring trust, I'm confident that working together, we will return the company to be the industry leader we all expect.\n\nRestoring trust starts with meeting our commitments -- whether that's building high quality, safe commercial aircraft, delivering on defense and space products that allow our customers to meet their mission, or servicing our products to keep our customers running 24/7. It also means meeting our commitments to each other and working collaboratively across Boeing to meet our goals. People's lives depend on what we do every day, and we must keep that top of mind with every decision we make.\n\nBecause what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company. I plan to be based in Seattle so that I can be close to the commercial airplane programs. In fact, I'll be on the factory floor in Renton today, talking with employees and learning about challenges we need to overcome, while also reviewing our safety and quality plans. Soon I'll be visiting many of our sites and I look forward to meeting with teammates around the world.\n\nIn speaking with our customers and industry partners leading up to today, I can tell you that without exception, everyone wants us to succeed. In many cases, they NEED us to succeed. This is a great foundation for us to build upon.\n\nI will be transparent with you every step of the way, sharing news on progress as well as where we must do things better. You'll begin to see routine report outs from me through email and our BNN channel, giving you timely updates of what I'm seeing and hearing on the ground from our teammates and our stakeholders.\n\nThroughout my career in aerospace over the last three decades, I have had the pleasure to work with The Boeing Company and I've always been impressed with the great employees here. We have what it takes to win, and I'm committed to working with you to focus the company in a way that makes us all proud to be a part of Boeing.\n\nThanks for your support and I'm excited to dig in!\n\nBest,\n\nKelly\n\n/Public Release.

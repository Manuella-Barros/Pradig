These include daily top-fold updates of rapidly emerging, Russian made nuclear weapons looming on orbit and purpose-built to wipe out nearly all space progress of the last 60 years. Additionally, there is a budget agreement between political parties in a divided government, which both sides now agree is insufficient. Monstrous deficits and unprecedented cost overruns on long overdue modernizations that crowd out the already downsized budgets. To top it off, it\u2019s an election year, where posturing and signaling advances a politician\u2019s career much further than actually passing legislation. But fear not fellow space veterans and enthusiasts, not only have we survived insufficient funding before \u2013 in retrospect, the future has often turned out better because of it. There will always be alarmists who seem to hustle for a living, trying to convince the rest of us that we cannot possibly secure our nation\u2019s interests to, from, and in space without more government funding. But history shows that it is often in times of austerity that great leaders emerge to solve the real problems and lay the foundation for a more prosperous and secure future. Ironically, the greatest innovations in air warfare were not conceived and tested during boom times but between the two world wars, when defense budgets were slashed. The two most important strategic inventions: aerial refueling and strategic bombing, happened during the most restrictive years of the Army Air Corps budget. Their development and operational testing on shoestring budgets turned the tide of WWII and delivered the win for Allied forces. Aerial refueling, invented and demonstrated in the 1920\u2019s with the famous Question Mark aircraft, enabled strategic bombing, fiercely advocated for and demonstrated with the controversial aerial bombing of a captured German ship by the legendary Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell. It was when those early air power pioneers had the least that they were the most innovative. Perhaps more famously and still very much in the space community\u2019s conscience, is the downturn in space budgets with the inauguration of President Obama in 2009. Within days of being sworn in, his administration was faced with the impossible task of delivering on a NASA program called Constellation, initiated under President Bush and left woefully underfunded. Only a few years later came the era of sequestration when major cuts to defense spending were mandated as part of budget compromises necessary with a politically divided government. In each of these times, the political solution was to slash budgets. But what too often is forgotten is that serious problem solvers rose to challenge by facing the facts head on without accounting gimmicks, turning them into the opening act of a new American space renaissance. Against all odds, and the entire space establishment at the time, Lori Garver, the Associate NASA Administrator fashioned the Commercial Resupply and Commercial Crew programs to replace the current programs of record. By pivoting the very essence of the NASA brand to the inconceivable \u2013 the privatization of human space flight \u2013 she was able to save America\u2019s space program and unleashed it to lead the world for the next decade.

SpaceX\u2019s early Falcon 9 launches helped it transition into the world leader in space launch and commercial telecommunications. And hundreds of American entrepreneurs have since founded space companies inspired by Garver\u2019s bold plan of action and SpaceX\u2019s audacity to challenge the status quo. More significantly, these dramatic cuts forced us to address the missions that still had to be accomplished, prompting an urgency to quickly innovate new solutions. From those difficult years, ideas like public-private partnerships, reusable rockets, mesh networking, and even the idea of using commercial manufacturing techniques became real, leaving our industry forever changed for the better. Such contentious defense budget toplines ultimately boil down to political fights, and the military is always best off not getting caught in the crossfire. The ugly, unspoken truth is that the entrenched industry and their hired trade associations and beltway bandits have already begun their usual moaning that there isn\u2019t enough funding, despite knowing there is enough money to do what needs to be done. In times like these, the uniformed military doesn\u2019t really need nor benefit from inside the beltway, armchair-warrior political hacks. It needs to heed Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s timeless (borrowed) advice: \u201cDo what you can, with what you\u2019ve got, where you are.\u201d The Space Force, much like the Army Air Corp and NASA before them, will have to make a choice: it can sulk about its small budget compared to the other services and do nothing, or move to innovate solutions for a better future. Unlike the other services, most Space Force resources are expended on developing and deploying systems, not people. That\u2019s a great place to start because many of those systems are on the verge of recapitalization and could be done with largely commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software. Constellations of low cost, highly resilient satellites costing less than $10 million a piece can replace satellites that cost billions to build and operate. Many missions can be opened to robust paths of international partnering, commercial augmentation, and privatization, much like NASA has done successfully with Artemis. Many companies and countries around the world are ready to help, but they should be invited in, not forced to sue their way in, the way SpaceX had to. These ideas and others will actually save money and expand our space dominance, just as gutsy, innovative leaders were able to do in previous generations. We have extraordinary challenges on the horizon \u2013 international threats that are appearing more existential by the week, a divided government that does not appear to be on the mend, and smaller budgets \u2013 but our greatest strength in the face of adversity has always been ingenuity, sincere commitment, and grit. We must find it inside ourselves once again to secure our space future. Follow me on Twitter.

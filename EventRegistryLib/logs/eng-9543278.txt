Adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.16 for both periods.\n\nThe following chart summarizes the consolidated financial results for the three-months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, based on all properties owned during those periods ($ in millions, except margin percentages and per share data):\n\nJeffrey H. Fisher, Chatham's president and chief executive officer, emphasized, \"We are quite pleased with our strong start to the year, delivering adjusted FFO per share of $0.16, beating consensus estimates as our hotel EBITDA margins outperformed our expectations. RevPAR growth of 2 percent was in the middle of our guidance, and our earnings beat was driven by hotel EBITDA margins exceeding our midpoint by approximately 230 basis points. RevPAR growth easily surpassed industry performance, and our EBITDA margins benefited from a 17 percent increase in other operating department profit and a $0.8 million or 13 percent decrease in property tax expense resulting from refunds on certain hotels.\"\n\n\"In addition to our operating results, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the sale of the 24-year old Hilton Garden Inn Denver Tech Center for $18 million earlier this year while also avoiding a $6 million renovation. At quarter end, our net debt to trailing twelve month EBITDA was a very healthy 4.0 times, and we will continue to opportunistically sell additional assets in 2024 with the intent to redeploy those proceeds into debt reduction and ultimately make higher growth hotel investments,\" Fisher highlighted.\n\nHotel RevPAR Performance\n\nThe below chart summarizes key hotel financial statistics for the hotels owned as of March 31, 2024, compared to the 2023 and 2019 first quarter:\n\nThe below chart summarizes RevPAR statistics by month for the company's hotels:\n\nFisher continued, \"Our first quarter RevPAR growth of 2 percent was 7X industry-wide RevPAR growth, and as we have stated, our portfolio should continue to outperform the industry given the resurgence of our primarily technology dependent markets. RevPAR growth at our five tech hotels in Silicon Valley and Bellevue accelerated 17 percent in the first quarter, and April RevPAR growth at these same hotels remained strong, growing 12 percent.\n\n\"Gains in portfolio occupancy are coming from business travel and this is vital to Chatham's growth trajectory. First quarter weekday occupancy was the highest since 2019 and for the first time since the pandemic, first quarter weekday occupancy outpaced weekend occupancy. Weekday occupancy gained two percent while weekend occupancy slipped two percent. Portfolio ADR improved slightly in the quarter, and we should generate incremental ADR growth as demand in our tech markets expands.\"\n\nRevPAR performance for Chatham's largest markets comprise 70 percent of trailing twelve-month hotel EBITDA (based on EBITDA contribution over the last twelve months) is presented below:\n\n\"First of all, it is great to see the growth in Silicon Valley and Bellevue as corporate travel demand continues to increase and as a result, leading to occupancy growth of 12 percent over last year to a post-pandemic first quarter high of 67 percent. San Francisco's airport saw international passenger traffic surpass 2019 levels in February and March for the first time since 2020. ADRs in Silicon Valley and Bellevue rose five percent in the quarter, and as demand approaches 2019 levels, currently 90 percent of 2019, we will have the leverage to push rates higher,\" asserted Dennis Craven, Chatham's chief operating officer. \"Excluding Silicon Valley and Bellevue, first quarter RevPAR of $119 exceeds 2019 levels by 3 percent.\n\nCraven commented further, \"Continuing a great trend from the second half of last year, our Greater New York and Washington, D.C., hotels are experiencing meaningful RevPAR gains attributable to strong underlying demand fundamentals. For the first time since the start of the pandemic, RevPAR at our D.C. area hotels has surpassed 2019 levels, and our Greater New York hotel RevPAR has exceeded 2019 for each of the past four quarters. As we stated last quarter, San Diego is poised for a strong 2024 given the increase in large conventions in 2024 and was able to shake-off the impact awful weather had on February conventions to have a solid quarter.\n\n\"Among our major markets, Los Angeles is the only market really underperforming expectations as the entire market has been soft. We gained RevPAR market share in our three Los Angeles area hotels during the quarter. The Austin market was expected to soften this quarter after a significant amount of corporate group demand last year,\" Craven concluded.\n\nApproximately 64 percent of Chatham's hotel EBITDA over the last twelve months was generated from its extended-stay hotels, the highest concentration of extended-stay rooms of any public lodging REIT. First quarter 2024 occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for each of the company's major brands is presented below (number of hotels in parentheses):\n\nThe Homewood and Hilton Garden Inn declines were impacted by renovations.\n\nHotel Operations Performance\n\nThe below chart summarizes key hotel operating performance measures for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Gross operating profit is calculated as hotel EBITDA plus property taxes, ground rent and insurance (in millions, except for RevPAR and margin percentages):\n\nCraven remarked, \"It's encouraging in a low RevPAR growth quarter that we were able to minimize our GOP margin loss through aggressive cost control management while pushing other revenue initiatives across our platform. Compared to the 2023 first quarter, labor costs adversely impacted our GOP margins by approximately 110 basis points, but the good news is average labor costs across all hourly positions has stabilized over the past nine months. Our first quarter average hourly wage is essentially unchanged from 2023 third and fourth quarter average hourly wages. We continue to push our other revenue initiatives, specifically parking and hotel retail markets, and we were able to increase our other operating department by 17 percent and generate an additional $0.4 million of hotel EBITDA.\"\n\nHotel EBITDA margins improved 10 basis points in the quarter as property tax refunds of $0.8 million offset the GOP decline of $0.5 million.\n\nCorporate Update\n\nThe below chart summarizes key financial performance measures for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Corporate EBITDA is calculated as hotel EBITDA minus cash corporate general and administrative expenses and is before debt service and capital expenditures. Debt service includes interest expense and principal amortization on its secured debt, as well as dividends on its preferred shares of $2.0 million per quarter. Cash flow before CapEx and common dividends is calculated as corporate EBITDA less debt service and preferred share dividends. Amounts are in millions, except RevPAR.\n\nHotel Investments\n\nDuring the 2024 first quarter, the company incurred capital expenditures of $10 million. Chatham's 2024 capital expenditure budget is approximately $37 million. During the quarter, renovations on the Hilton Garden Inn Marina Del Rey, Calif.; Homewood Suites San Antonio, Texas; Hyatt Place Denver Cherry Creek, Colo.; and the Embassy Suites Springfield, Va., were completed. No renovations are planned for the 2024 second quarter.\n\nCapital Markets & Capital Structure\n\nDuring the first quarter, Chatham used free cash flow to reduce its net debt by approximately $6 million. As of March 31, 2024, the company had net debt of $412 million (total consolidated debt less unrestricted cash). Total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2024, was $484.5 million at an average interest rate of 5.5 percent, comprised of $394.5 million of fixed-rate mortgage debt at an average interest rate of 5.2 percent, $90 million outstanding on its term loan at a rate of 6.9% and nothing outstanding on the company's $260 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Based on the ratio of the company's net debt to hotel investments at cost, Chatham's leverage ratio was approximately 25 percent on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nSubsequent to the end of the first quarter, the company:\n\n\"With respect to the additional Term Loan commitments, we appreciate the continued support of Regions and Capital One, and are thrilled to add J.P. Morgan into our high-quality team of lenders,\" commented Jeremy Wegner, Chatham's chief financial officer. \"Although we have approximately $252 million of debt maturing in July, we have plenty of liquidity to address those maturities and are thrilled to remove this overhang.\"\n\nDividend\n\nDuring the quarter, the Board of Trustees declared a preferred share dividend of $0.41406 per share, as well as a common share dividend of $0.07 per share, payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024.\n\n2024 Second Quarter Guidance\n\nThe company's 2024 second quarter guidance reflects the following assumptions:\n\nThe company provides guidance but does not undertake to update it for any developments in its business. Achievement of the results is subject to the risks disclosed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nEarnings Call\n\nThe company will hold its first quarter 2024 conference call later today at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Shareholders and other interested parties may listen to a simultaneous webcast of the conference call on the Internet by logging onto Chatham's Web site, www.chathamlodgingtrust.com, or may participate in the conference call by dialing 1-877-407-0789 or 1-201-689-8562 and referencing Chatham Lodging Trust.

A replay of the conference call will be posted on Chatham's website.\n\nAbout Chatham Lodging Trust\n\nChatham Lodging Trust is a self-advised, publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) focused primarily on investing in upscale, extended-stay hotels and premium-branded, select-service hotels. The company owns 38 hotels totaling 5,735 rooms/suites in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Additional information about Chatham may be found at chathamlodgingtrust.com.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIncluded in this press release are certain \"non-GAAP financial measures,\" within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, that are different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). The company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (5) EBITDAre (6) Adjusted EBITDA and (7) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as prescribed by GAAP as a measure of its operating performance.\n\nFFO As Defined by Nareit and Adjusted FFO\n\nThe company calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by the Nareit, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment write-downs, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures following the same approach. The company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it measures its performance without regard to specified non-cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate assets and certain other items that the company believes are not indicative of the property level performance of its hotel properties. The company believes that these items reflect historical cost of its asset base and its acquisition and disposition activities and are less reflective of its ongoing operations, and that by adjusting to exclude the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that also report using the Nareit definition.\n\nThe company calculates Adjusted FFO by further adjusting FFO for certain additional items that are not addressed in Nareit's definition of FFO, including other charges, losses on the early extinguishment of debt and similar items related to its unconsolidated real estate entities that it believes do not represent costs related to hotel operations. The company believes that Adjusted FFO provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs that make similar adjustments to FFO.\n\nEBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA\n\nThe company calculates EBITDA for purposes of the credit facility debt as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; (3) depreciation and amortization; and (4) unconsolidated real estate entity items including interest, depreciation and amortization excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate. The company believes EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance because it helps investors compare the company's operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from its operating results. In addition, the company uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.\n\nThe company calculates EBITDAre in accordance with Nareit guidelines, which defines EBITDAre as net income or loss excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe that the presentation of EBITDAre provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs.\n\nThe company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by further adjusting EBITDA for certain additional items, including other charges, losses on the early extinguishment of debt, amortization of non-cash share-based compensation and similar items related to its unconsolidated real estate entities, which it believes are not indicative of the performance of its underlying hotel properties entities. The company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures.\n\nAdjusted Hotel EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, corporate general and administrative, impairment loss, loss on early extinguishment of debt, interest and other income and income or loss from unconsolidated real estate entities. The Company presents Adjusted Hotel EBITDA because the Company believes it is useful to investors in comparing its hotel operating performance between periods and comparing its Adjusted Hotel EBITDA margins to those of our peer companies. Adjusted Hotel EBITDA represents the results of operations for its wholly owned hotels only.\n\nAlthough the company presents FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA because it believes they are useful to investors in comparing the company's operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures, these measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are:\n\nIn addition, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not measures of the Company's liquidity. Because of these limitations, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA only supplementally. The Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company's reconciliation of FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA to net income attributable to common shareholders, as determined under GAAP, is set forth below.\n\nForward-Looking Statement Safe Harbor\n\nNote: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations.

Fisher, Chatham's president and chief executive officer, emphasized, \"We are quite pleased with our strong start to the year, delivering adjusted FFO per share of $0.16, beating consensus estimates as our hotel EBITDA margins outperformed our expectations. RevPAR growth of 2 percent was in the middle of our guidance, and our earnings beat was driven by hotel EBITDA margins exceeding our midpoint by approximately 230 basis points. RevPAR growth easily surpassed industry performance, and our EBITDA margins benefited from a 17 percent increase in other operating department profit and a $0.8 million or 13 percent decrease in property tax expense resulting from refunds on certain hotels.\"\n\n\"In addition to our operating results, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the sale of the 24-year old Hilton Garden Inn Denver Tech Center for $18 million earlier this year while also avoiding a $6 million renovation. At quarter end, our net debt to trailing twelve month EBITDA was a very healthy 4.0 times, and we will continue to opportunistically sell additional assets in 2024 with the intent to redeploy those proceeds into debt reduction and ultimately make higher growth hotel investments,\" Fisher highlighted.\n\nHotel RevPAR Performance\n\nThe below chart summarizes key hotel financial statistics for the hotels owned as of March 31, 2024, compared to the 2023 and 2019 first quarter:\n\nThe below chart summarizes RevPAR statistics by month for the company's hotels:\n\nFisher continued, \"Our first quarter RevPAR growth of 2 percent was 7X industry-wide RevPAR growth, and as we have stated, our portfolio should continue to outperform the industry given the resurgence of our primarily technology dependent markets. RevPAR growth at our five tech hotels in Silicon Valley and Bellevue accelerated 17 percent in the first quarter, and April RevPAR growth at these same hotels remained strong, growing 12 percent.\n\n\"Gains in portfolio occupancy are coming from business travel and this is vital to Chatham's growth trajectory. First quarter weekday occupancy was the highest since 2019 and for the first time since the pandemic, first quarter weekday occupancy outpaced weekend occupancy. Weekday occupancy gained two percent while weekend occupancy slipped two percent. Portfolio ADR improved slightly in the quarter, and we should generate incremental ADR growth as demand in our tech markets expands.\"\n\nRevPAR performance for Chatham's largest markets comprise 70 percent of trailing twelve-month hotel EBITDA (based on EBITDA contribution over the last twelve months) is presented below:\n\n\"First of all, it is great to see the growth in Silicon Valley and Bellevue as corporate travel demand continues to increase and as a result, leading to occupancy growth of 12 percent over last year to a post-pandemic first quarter high of 67 percent. San Francisco's airport saw international passenger traffic surpass 2019 levels in February and March for the first time since 2020. ADRs in Silicon Valley and Bellevue rose five percent in the quarter, and as demand approaches 2019 levels, currently 90 percent of 2019, we will have the leverage to push rates higher,\" asserted Dennis Craven, Chatham's chief operating officer. \"Excluding Silicon Valley and Bellevue, first quarter RevPAR of $119 exceeds 2019 levels by 3 percent.\n\nCraven commented further, \"Continuing a great trend from the second half of last year, our Greater New York and Washington, D.C., hotels are experiencing meaningful RevPAR gains attributable to strong underlying demand fundamentals. For the first time since the start of the pandemic, RevPAR at our D.C. area hotels has surpassed 2019 levels, and our Greater New York hotel RevPAR has exceeded 2019 for each of the past four quarters. As we stated last quarter, San Diego is poised for a strong 2024 given the increase in large conventions in 2024 and was able to shake-off the impact awful weather had on February conventions to have a solid quarter.\n\n\"Among our major markets, Los Angeles is the only market really underperforming expectations as the entire market has been soft. We gained RevPAR market share in our three Los Angeles area hotels during the quarter. The Austin market was expected to soften this quarter after a significant amount of corporate group demand last year,\" Craven concluded.\n\nApproximately 64 percent of Chatham's hotel EBITDA over the last twelve months was generated from its extended-stay hotels, the highest concentration of extended-stay rooms of any public lodging REIT. First quarter 2024 occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for each of the company's major brands is presented below (number of hotels in parentheses):\n\nThe Homewood and Hilton Garden Inn declines were impacted by renovations.\n\nHotel Operations Performance\n\nThe below chart summarizes key hotel operating performance measures for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Gross operating profit is calculated as hotel EBITDA plus property taxes, ground rent and insurance (in millions, except for RevPAR and margin percentages):\n\nCraven remarked, \"It's encouraging in a low RevPAR growth quarter that we were able to minimize our GOP margin loss through aggressive cost control management while pushing other revenue initiatives across our platform. Compared to the 2023 first quarter, labor costs adversely impacted our GOP margins by approximately 110 basis points, but the good news is average labor costs across all hourly positions has stabilized over the past nine months. Our first quarter average hourly wage is essentially unchanged from 2023 third and fourth quarter average hourly wages. We continue to push our other revenue initiatives, specifically parking and hotel retail markets, and we were able to increase our other operating department by 17 percent and generate an additional $0.4 million of hotel EBITDA.\"\n\nHotel EBITDA margins improved 10 basis points in the quarter as property tax refunds of $0.8 million offset the GOP decline of $0.5 million.\n\nCorporate Update\n\nThe below chart summarizes key financial performance measures for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Corporate EBITDA is calculated as hotel EBITDA minus cash corporate general and administrative expenses and is before debt service and capital expenditures. Debt service includes interest expense and principal amortization on its secured debt, as well as dividends on its preferred shares of $2.0 million per quarter. Cash flow before CapEx and common dividends is calculated as corporate EBITDA less debt service and preferred share dividends. Amounts are in millions, except RevPAR.\n\nHotel Investments\n\nDuring the 2024 first quarter, the company incurred capital expenditures of $10 million. Chatham's 2024 capital expenditure budget is approximately $37 million. During the quarter, renovations on the Hilton Garden Inn Marina Del Rey, Calif.; Homewood Suites San Antonio, Texas; Hyatt Place Denver Cherry Creek, Colo.; and the Embassy Suites Springfield, Va., were completed. No renovations are planned for the 2024 second quarter.\n\nCapital Markets & Capital Structure\n\nDuring the first quarter, Chatham used free cash flow to reduce its net debt by approximately $6 million. As of March 31, 2024, the company had net debt of $412 million (total consolidated debt less unrestricted cash). Total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2024, was $484.5 million at an average interest rate of 5.5 percent, comprised of $394.5 million of fixed-rate mortgage debt at an average interest rate of 5.2 percent, $90 million outstanding on its term loan at a rate of 6.9% and nothing outstanding on the company's $260 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Based on the ratio of the company's net debt to hotel investments at cost, Chatham's leverage ratio was approximately 25 percent on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nSubsequent to the end of the first quarter, the company:\n\n\"With respect to the additional Term Loan commitments, we appreciate the continued support of Regions and Capital One, and are thrilled to add J.P. Morgan into our high-quality team of lenders,\" commented Jeremy Wegner, Chatham's chief financial officer. \"Although we have approximately $252 million of debt maturing in July, we have plenty of liquidity to address those maturities and are thrilled to remove this overhang.\"\n\nDividend\n\nDuring the quarter, the Board of Trustees declared a preferred share dividend of $0.41406 per share, as well as a common share dividend of $0.07 per share, payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024.\n\n2024 Second Quarter Guidance\n\nThe company's 2024 second quarter guidance reflects the following assumptions:\n\nThe company provides guidance but does not undertake to update it for any developments in its business. Achievement of the results is subject to the risks disclosed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nEarnings Call\n\nThe company will hold its first quarter 2024 conference call later today at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Shareholders and other interested parties may listen to a simultaneous webcast of the conference call on the Internet by logging onto Chatham's Web site, www.chathamlodgingtrust.com, or may participate in the conference call by dialing 1-877-407-0789 or 1-201-689-8562 and referencing Chatham Lodging Trust.

A replay of the conference call will be posted on Chatham's website.\n\nAbout Chatham Lodging Trust\n\nChatham Lodging Trust is a self-advised, publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) focused primarily on investing in upscale, extended-stay hotels and premium-branded, select-service hotels. The company owns 38 hotels totaling 5,735 rooms/suites in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Additional information about Chatham may be found at chathamlodgingtrust.com.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIncluded in this press release are certain \"non-GAAP financial measures,\" within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, that are different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). The company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (5) EBITDAre (6) Adjusted EBITDA and (7) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as prescribed by GAAP as a measure of its operating performance.\n\nFFO As Defined by Nareit and Adjusted FFO\n\nThe company calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by the Nareit, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment write-downs, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures following the same approach. The company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it measures its performance without regard to specified non-cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate assets and certain other items that the company believes are not indicative of the property level performance of its hotel properties. The company believes that these items reflect historical cost of its asset base and its acquisition and disposition activities and are less reflective of its ongoing operations, and that by adjusting to exclude the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that also report using the Nareit definition.\n\nThe company calculates Adjusted FFO by further adjusting FFO for certain additional items that are not addressed in Nareit's definition of FFO, including other charges, losses on the early extinguishment of debt and similar items related to its unconsolidated real estate entities that it believes do not represent costs related to hotel operations. The company believes that Adjusted FFO provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs that make similar adjustments to FFO.\n\nEBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA\n\nThe company calculates EBITDA for purposes of the credit facility debt as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; (3) depreciation and amortization; and (4) unconsolidated real estate entity items including interest, depreciation and amortization excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate. The company believes EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance because it helps investors compare the company's operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from its operating results. In addition, the company uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.\n\nThe company calculates EBITDAre in accordance with Nareit guidelines, which defines EBITDAre as net income or loss excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe that the presentation of EBITDAre provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs.\n\nThe company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by further adjusting EBITDA for certain additional items, including other charges, losses on the early extinguishment of debt, amortization of non-cash share-based compensation and similar items related to its unconsolidated real estate entities, which it believes are not indicative of the performance of its underlying hotel properties entities. The company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures.\n\nAdjusted Hotel EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, corporate general and administrative, impairment loss, loss on early extinguishment of debt, interest and other income and income or loss from unconsolidated real estate entities. The Company presents Adjusted Hotel EBITDA because the Company believes it is useful to investors in comparing its hotel operating performance between periods and comparing its Adjusted Hotel EBITDA margins to those of our peer companies. Adjusted Hotel EBITDA represents the results of operations for its wholly owned hotels only.\n\nAlthough the company presents FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA because it believes they are useful to investors in comparing the company's operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures, these measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are:\n\nIn addition, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not measures of the Company's liquidity. Because of these limitations, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA only supplementally. The Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company's reconciliation of FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA to net income attributable to common shareholders, as determined under GAAP, is set forth below.\n\nForward-Looking Statement Safe Harbor\n\nNote: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations. These forward-looking statements include those with regard to the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of the lodging industry and our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, cash flow and plans and objectives.

The company experienced a 2% increase in revenue per available room (RevPAR) and a notable 20% rise in other operating profit.\n\nThis performance was bolstered by a strong showing in tech-driven hotels, particularly in Silicon Valley and Bellevue, where RevPAR surged by 17%. The company also announced plans to strategically sell lower-performing hotels and reinvest in higher-growth properties, while managing a robust balance sheet aimed at repaying maturing debt within the year.\n\nIn summary, Chatham Lodging Trust's first quarter of 2024 has been marked by strategic growth and strong financial performance, particularly in their tech-driven hotels. Despite some areas of underperformance, the company has a positive outlook for the future, with plans for capital recycling and leveraging market opportunities. Executives remain cautiously optimistic, providing conservative guidance for the upcoming quarter while navigating a dynamic market landscape.\n\nChatham Lodging Trust's (NYSE: CLDT) financial performance in Q1 2024 paints a picture of a company on a strategic growth path, particularly in the tech hotel sector. To add further context to this narrative, InvestingPro provides some additional insights.\n\nInvestingPro Data indicates a market capitalization of $450.09 million, suggesting that while CLDT is not one of the heavyweights in the industry, it has a significant presence. The company's P/E ratio, as per the last twelve months of Q4 2023, stands at -27.88, reflecting investor sentiment about its future earnings potential.\n\nDespite the negative earnings, the company's revenue grew by 5.55% over the same period, which aligns with the positive performance reported in the article. The gross profit margin was healthy at 48.47%, showing a strong ability to control costs relative to its revenue.\n\nFrom an InvestingPro Tips perspective, two points stand out. Firstly, CLDT is trading at a low EBITDA valuation multiple, which could indicate that the market has undervalued its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nThis could be a point of interest for value investors. Secondly, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, suggesting that it has a solid liquidity position to meet its immediate liabilities. This is particularly relevant given the company's focus on managing its balance sheet and repaying maturing debt.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into Chatham Lodging Trust's financial health and potential investment opportunities, InvestingPro offers additional tips at https://www.investing.com/pro/CLDT.

Now to provide you with some insight into Chatham's 2024 first quarter results, allow me to introduce Jeff Fisher, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Craven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jeremy Wegner, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Let me turn the session over to Jeff Fisher. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Fisher: Thanks, Chris, and I certainly appreciate everyone joining us this Monday morning for our call. As you know, we beat first quarter consensus estimates as we combined RevPAR growth of 2% together with an almost 20% increase in our other operating profit line and property tax refunds on a couple of our California hotels. We generated free cashflow of $8.3 million in the quarter up 10% over the 2023 first quarter. From an asset management perspective, we're laser focused on driving free cash flow any way we can, whether that's by increasing revenue or market share, increasing flow through, or enhancing ancillary operating profits. And in the first quarter, we drove other departmental profits up almost 20% as we increased parking rates in certain markets and enhanced our retail market operation product offerings and pricing. The year-over-year increase added a penny of FFO to our first quarter performance. The RevPAR increase of 2% was split evenly between occupancy and ADR, and was substantially greater than industry performance above Hilton's North American performance and right in line with Marriott's performance. Generating RevPAR growth and outperformance despite the bad weather in February and the shift of the Easter from April last year into March this year is noteworthy. Our RevPAR was boosted by RevPAR growth of 17% at our five tech hotels in Silicon Valley and Bellevue, and we saw occupancy gain 1,200 basis points at these hotels to 67%, by far the highest level since 2019. Excluding the five tech-driven hotels, first quarter RevPAR was down 1%, but still up over 2019 levels by 3%. Even better news is the strength we're seeing in April with RevPAR up 5% over 2023 and up 4% over 2019 levels with tech hotel RevPAR up 12% in April, and RevPAR for all hotels, excluding those same five tech hotels in April, was up 3.6%. Tech hotel occupancy finished at 73%, only 400 basis points off the 2019 levels. More encouraging news on the surging demand out there. April RevPAR growth most peers that have reported and supports our thesis that we should continue to outperform the industry and most of our peers in 2024 due to surging demand in our primarily tech driven hotels. Within Silicon Valley, we're confident that the corporate demand growth we saw in the first quarter in April will continue. Additionally, tech companies are moving forward with their intern programs. This year, many of the companies are providing a stipend to each intern to cover room and meals and the intern can choose where to stay. We're already seeing some intern bookings, not at the level as prior years, but as we talked about in February, so long as the intern programs are active, that is going to generate compression in the market, which is something we did not have last year, and obviously compression boosts occupancy and overall RevPAR results. Mountain View is our strongest market in the quarter, up 19%, as we saw meaningful gains in business travel specifically from our top accounts here, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and SureFox. Market demand growth has been upper single digits and long term the market sits up well for us as new supply is zero. RevPAR at our two Sunnyvale hotels gained 12% in the quarter and this market too is showing good underlying fundamentals. Demand is up 13% and future supply is up 1%. We're seeing corporate demand from our top accounts, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google, intuitive surgical and applied materials and specifically from the start of construction at the big epic center with the garage getting going and that, as we've talked about many times, should be very beneficial for these two hotels over the next few years. San Mateo RevPAR Growth was 6% in the quarter versus 2019. And it's recovered more than the three other Silicon Valley hotels. One aspect to that story is that recently the 476 room Marriott San Mateo permanently closed its doors which will increase Marriott system demand in the market and we should see some increased production here as well. During the quarter, we sold the Hilton Garden in Denver Tech for $18 million, and including deferred renovation costs, the hotel was sold for an approximate four cap on 2023 NOI. We intend to continue to opportunistically sell some hotels this year with the goal of redeploying those proceeds into higher RevPAR and higher growth hotels and markets. Typical sales targets are going to be hotels with absolute RevPAR and lower absolute RevPAR and margins, and probably hotels that are older that need some upcoming CapEx or regular cycle renovations. We're targeting sales proceeds of $40 million to $100 million, continuing to sell these types of hotels while buying, as I said, higher growth, higher RevPAR and higher margin hotels will enhance shareholder value and cash flow. With respect to hotel investments, we are seeing more deal volume and we hope to have an acquisition announced this quarter. Acquisition targets are coming from developers looking to recycle their own capital, as well as owners who are facing some meaningful risk related to refinancing and the effects there from. As we all know, the levels of CMBS debt maturing in 2024 and 2025 is pretty staggering for the industry and should provide additional opportunities for well-capitalized owners like us with the capacity to buy. I want to switch gears to address our capital structure as it's been a critically important focus for us over the last few quarters especially. At quarter end, we were at the lowest leverage levels in over a decade with leverage ratio under 25% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio are very healthy 4 times. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we further enhanced our financial strength, raising $50 million via increased borrowings under our term loan. We currently have 25 hotels that are unencumbered. Over the past few years, through a combination of asset sales, free cash flow, and the issuance of common and preferred equity, we've repositioned our balance sheet to handle the meaningful tranche of maturing debt this year, debt that dates back to 2014 during one of Chatham's highest growth phases since our IPO. We are well capitalized to repay all maturing debt this year. In April, we repaid the $29 million maturing mortgage on the residents in Anaheim, and we have $255 million maturing in July. Let me tell you, it's great to put this overhang behind us because we've heard about this for some time from analysts and investors and I'm proud of the work our team's been doing on this front and I'm sure our investors will share my sentiment. Including our $260 million credit facility and our upsized $140 million term loan, we have a $400 million of floating rate debt exposure that will allow us to benefit from what should be a declining interest rate environment in the future. So in conclusion, we remain confident that Chatham is well positioned to outperform most peers as we have the most internal growth upside, we think of most other lodging REITs, especially within our tech hotels. The remainder of our portfolio is performing well. New supply is less than 1% across our sub-markets, and our balance sheet is in great shape to be opportunistic on the transaction front. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Dennis.\n\nDennis Craven: Thanks, Jeff. Within our tech markets, in addition to Silicon Valley, our residents in Bellevue has been thriving this year with RevPAR growth of 40% in the quarter, and that's almost entirely due to occupancy growth of 37%. Demand growth was almost 20% in the Bellevue market as we are seeing acceleration in all business travel segments. Our standard retail segment, which is BT, room demand was up over 1,800 room nights or approximately 42%. And importantly, special corporate, meaning our key corporate accounts was up over 1,800 room nights or 55%. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Accenture (NYSE:ACN), and ByteDance or TikTok, all of which are historically top accounts for us, generated over 1,500 room nights in the quarter. And demand for Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) is surging as we look forward 60 days. In November, Amazon opened a portion of the Sonic building in Bellevue, welcoming more than 1,000 employees and intends to double its Bellevue workforce from 10,000 to 20,000 employees over the next couple of years. ByteDance has also expanded its office presence in Bellevue with two new office leases and with supply projected below 1% in the Bellevue market, this corporate expansion is very good news for the hotel and for us and it's going to help us continue to outperform. Some additional RevPAR tidbits from the quarter. Our first quarter RevPAR was not impacted by any renovation impact as we had three hotels with renovation disruption in each of the first quarters of 2023 and 2024. First quarter weekday occupancy was the highest since 2019. And for the first time since the pandemic, first quarter weekday occupancy outpaced weekend occupancy. Deployments, we continue to monitor San Francisco's airport saw international passenger traffic surpass 2019 levels in February and March for the first time since 2020. Total domestic traffic into SFO is up approximately 3%. At SeaTac, international deployments are up approximately 15% through February, and domestic is up about 1%. We're seeing most of that inbound travel generally coming from the Asia region. Outside of our tech driven markets are seven primarily leisure-oriented hotels that comprise approximately 19% of our first quarter room revenue saw RevPAR increased 1% year-over-year. Top gainers were Anaheim and Portland, and on the downside, our worst performers were Destin and Savannah. Weekday and weekend occupancy were approximately 70% for each of those periods with weekday ADR of $173, outpacing weekend RevPAR of $163. And that $10 gap compares to a $4 gap in the first quarter last year. Our top five RevPAR hotels were led by the Residence Inn Fort Lauderdale with RevPAR of $273, which was flat to last year. Our Residence Inn San Diego, Gaslamp at $195, followed by our Hilton Garden and Marina Del Rey at $167, despite being under renovation. And then followed by our Residence Inn Mountain View at $158, and our Residence Inn Washington, D.C., and White Plains, New York, both with RevPAR of $154. At our 38 comparable hotels, GOP margins were down 120 basis points with the majority of that attributable to labor and benefits, which adversely impacted margins by 110 basis points. On a CPOR basis, these costs are up approximately 6% year-over-year. Labor costs, which are by far our largest expenses, have stabilized over the past nine months or three quarters. Our first quarter average hourly wage is essentially unchanged from our 2023 third and fourth quarter hourly wages. Our employee headcount remains about 20% below pre-pandemic levels, and we are not experiencing really any labor supply shortfalls around our markets. Thankfully, as we've talked about for a few quarters now, our margin comps will become easier after the second quarter as we are still ramping up housekeeping and other brand required expenses in the first half of 2023. Our top five producers of GOP in the quarter were led by our Gaslamp Residence Inn with $2.5 million. The ninth straight quarter it's led our portfolio, followed by our tech heavy Sunnyvale II Residence Inn with a $1.5 million of GOP. And third was our Residences Inn Fort Lauderdale, and rounding out the top five were our Courtyard Dallas downtown in our Embassy Suite Springfield which managed to reach our top five despite being under renovation for most of the quarter. Importantly looking into hotel GOP at our five tech driven hotels, hotel GOP of $5.3 million was up a strong 22% over the 2023 first quarter. GOP margins for the five hotels were up 110 basis points, and GOP at Residences Inn Bellevue was up approximately 80%. Tech hotel EBITDA was up almost $1 million or over 25%. So again, encouraging trends coming out of these markets. As we previously disclosed, if we get back to 2019 EBITDA levels we would add approximately $16 million of EBITDA or over $0.30 of FFO. With respect to capital expenditures, we spent approximately $10 million in the quarter and still expect to spend about $37 million in 2024. During the quarter we completed renovations at our Hilton Garden in Marina Del Rey, our Homewood Suites in San Antonio, our Hyatt Place Cherry Creek, and lastly, our Embassy Suites in Springfield, Virginia. We have no renovations planned for the second quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Wegner: Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. Our Q1, 2023 hotel EBITDA was $21 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $18.9 million. And adjusted FFO per share was $0.16. We were able to generate a GOP margin of 38.6% and hotel EBITDA margin of 30.8% in Q1. While our Q1 GOP margin was down 120 basis points from our Q1 2023 margin. We are seeing a stabilization of most of the large cost increases that we saw in the second half of last year. Our Q1 hotel EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points versus Q1 2023 due to approximately $800,000 of property tax refunds received Q1 of this year. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition and we have made significant progress on our plan to address debt maturities. In January 2024, we completed the sale of the HGI Denver Tech for approximately $18 million, which included an expected renovation cost of approximately $6 million, represents an EBITDA multiple of 20.5 times and a cap rate of 3.8%. Our cash balance at the end of Q1 was $72.3 million, which together with $50 million of incremental proceeds raised through an add-on to our unsecured term loan that we closed last week, provide a pro forma quarter end cash balance of $122.3 million. With a pro forma cash balance of $122.3 million and $260 million of undrawn availability under our revolving line of credit, our pro forma total liquidity of $382 million exceeds the $281 million of remaining debt outstanding at March 31st that matures in Q2 and Q3 by over $100 million. We are currently in the process of executing $60 million of CMBS financing, which will further reduce the revolving credit facility utilization required to address our remaining debt maturities. We expect these CMBS financings to close in the next month and have rates in the 7% to 7.25% area. As of March 31st, Chatham's net debt to LTM EBITDA was 4 times, which is significantly below our pre-pandemic leverage, which is generally in the 5.5 times to 6 times area, despite the fact that EBITDA has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Turning to guidance for Q2, we expect RevPAR growth of 2.5% to 4%, adjusted EBITDA of $28.7 million to $30.4 million, and adjusted FFO per share of $0.33 to $0.36. Our Q2 cash interest expense guidance of $7.7 million reflects the $50 million term loan add-on we completed in early May and assumed $60 million of CMBS issuance in the second half of May. We expect Q2 interest income of approximately $700,000. Second quarter interest expense and interest income do not represent run rates for Q3 and Q4 as our cash balances are much higher in May and June due to the borrowing of money in May to fund the July debt maturities. With respect to hotel EBITDA margins, in general we expect year-over-year margin comparisons to be much easier starting in Q3 as we begin to lap the fuller staffing levels and other costs that were not completely reflected until the second half of last year. Year-over-year EBITDA margin comparisons in Q2 2024 are impacted by approximately $1.2 million of one-time benefits depositably impacted margins in Q2 of 2023. This concludes my portion of the call. Operator, please open the line for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today comes from the line of Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nAri Klein: Thanks, and good morning. Can you provide a little more color on the weekend occupancy dynamics and what you think might be driving that? And is there an element of consumer softness that you're seeing, where lower-end consumer seems to be feeling a little more pressure these days?\n\nDennis Craven: Hey, Ari. This is Dennis. Yes, I mean, listen, I think, for the first time in a while, I think first quarter weekend occupancy was about the same as weekday, but it was down, as you noted, 200 basis points, really driven by Savannah and Destin. And I think, listen, I think consistent with what you've heard from other hotel owners, if you had exposure in certain parts of what I would call Florida or other high leisure markets that really spiked in 2021 and 2022 from the pandemic, those have seen a little bit of a pullback. And I think as we've talked about really now for over a year is that, we believed and expected that the leisure markets would soften and as you started to see finally people getting back into the office and working and eventually transitioning that leisure oriented travel to be more business travel. And I think that's essentially what we saw. If you look at our seven hotels, I think we talked about Destin and Savannah were the worst. But really outside of that we had a good mix. Anaheim was up 15%, Pittsburgh was up 11%, Portland up 11%, Portsmouth, New Hampshire down 4%, and Fort Lauderdale was up 1%. So I think it's really just specific to where those leisure hotels are. But, again, kind of not surprising.\n\nAri Klein: Got it. And then just -- you talked a little bit about what you're doing on the other revenues, things like parking to enhance kind of growth and profit. What's the incremental opportunity that you still see there?\n\nDennis Craven: Yes, I mean, listen, I think, we put out some pretty broad increases in March of this year on the parking front. At certain hotels we're tweaking our initiatives to include what I would kind of refer to as surge pricing. So for example, you have a Taylor Swift concert over multiple days, people are there for five or six days, you typically charge $10 a night for parking. Well, most parking lots, most parking structures around there are changing their pricing when you have big time citywide events or something like that. From a hotel perspective, we should do more of that also. So it's being a little more nimble. It's being a little more active in looking at demand within the market from really a lodging perspective and saying, hey, can we continue to move parking revenue higher? The other side is on the retail front, which is where we spent some time over the past six to 12 months really trying to focus on our product offerings within our market, making sure we've got the stuff primarily if you're really thinking about it, quick grab stuff and especially beer, wine and in some jurisdictions liquor to be able to not only offer more of it, but look at the pricing of it as well. So I think we still have some runway there.\n\nAri Klein: Understood. And then just on the tech [indiscernible] flexibility that companies are providing out there, do you think that that's the new normal? And do you have a sense of the size of the intern program this year relative to what they were previously?\n\nDennis Craven: Well there was essentially no interns last year, so it's going to be well up from last year. I think you're probably -- as we kind of sit here today, intern levels are less than what they were in 2019 just in terms of the overall programs. Having said that, the stipend program is something I think, listen, there's many different types of accommodations in those markets, whether it's apartments, short-term rentals, Airbnb's, and lodging, so -- and corporate housing. So, by providing that flexibility, it's giving a little bit more control to the intern. Those, by the way, just to clarify, those have always been there. So as I talked about in our prepared remarks and as we mentioned it back in February, any compression from these intern programs, whether it's at our hotel or in the other offerings, ultimately is something that was not there last year and should benefit the entire market as we move forward into the summer and into the programs. But all the companies we do business with seem to be having internships and most of them are doing the stipends. There are a few that are not and we're having regular discussions with those.\n\nJeffrey Fisher: Of course, this is Jeff. The change means, again, a lack of visibility on our part relative to the quantity overall. So, we're not being coy here. We know the business will be there. We know the markets will be up. They are up substantially as you've heard. But if you're not able to negotiate directly with those companies like we have in the past, then we just have to do all we can to attract those folks from -- compared to the different sources they've got.\n\nAri Klein: Thank you. Appreciate all the color.\n\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bryan Maher with B Riley Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBryan Maher: Thank you, and good morning. Just a couple from me today. I don't know, maybe for Jeremy or Dennis. On the cost pressures, can you tell us kind of where you're seeing the most and the least release in those categories?\n\nDennis Craven: Yes. I mean, listen, I think, surprisingly, I think as I've talked about in our prepared remarks, staffing is really not much of an issue across most of our markets. I think we've, obviously, heard a lot of things going on in California with respect to fast food, minimum wages. That really hasn't impacted us at all out in those markets. There really aren't a whole lot of what I would call large scale cost increases that we sit here and are worried about at the moment. If you look at our P&L corporate real estate taxes, just from a pure comparable basis, and thankfully we benefited from some refunds in the first quarter, but in general, if you look at our largest increases in expenses, it's really probably real estate taxes and property insurance. [Multiple Speakers] Yes, I mean -- and that was the last thing I was going to talk about, which is health insurance just continues to be a pain in everyone's butt with -- it seems like every year there's double digit increases.\n\nJeffrey Fisher: And on the positive side, for utilities we're starting to see costs actually come down year-over-year there, so should be a little help.\n\nBryan Maher: Do you expect any more tax refunds that move the needle at all, or is that pretty much behind you?\n\nDennis Craven: We don't expect anything, but we're constantly appealing assessments, so you never know. I mean, we've reflected everything here that we -- that has happened or that we know about, but we'll keep pushing.\n\nBryan Maher: Okay. And then just last for me, it seems like we should be expecting more capital recycling with dispositions and likely acquisitions over the next, let's say, six to 18 months than we've seen in a little while. Can you tell me, and maybe for Jeff, what are the criteria that you're looking for kind of the most, maybe kind of one, two, and three on the list of markets that you want to enter. Is it migration, is it business growth, what is it in a market that you're looking for?\n\nJeffrey Fisher: Thanks, I think yes, just to kind of buttress what you're saying, we were very encouraged by the ability to sell that Denver Tech Hotel at the number we did. We were encouraged by the relatively high number of bidders that were on the deal. So that really caused us to take a real hard look at our 10-year CapEx plan, the cycle rentals and other renovations that would be coming up, age of hotels, and of course, the world is different since COVID. There are markets that were very strong that just are either slow to recover or we don't think really have a lot more upside left in them. Those are hotels that we're going to sell. And we want to be in markets where the population growth is strong anytime we bought a hotel or developed a hotel in a market where population growth was strong, business growth was strong, because that's still the core of what we do around here. As you know, I mean, 80% of these hotels are business trends in related or corporate hotels that shows you the strength that we're having this year so far. And that will be our focus for hotels that we try to acquire. They should be 10 years old or less for the most part. And we do see some deals that are brand new deals where some developers need to take care of some maturities or recycle their own capital for some other hotels they may have under construction around the country. There's still a few folks out there that have some older pipelines, older meaning, deals that already are underway because we all know there's not a ton of brand new deals getting started. And we see that as a decent source of acquisitions also.\n\nBryan Maher: Okay, thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Tyler Batory with Oppenheimer. Please see with your question.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Jonathan on for Tyler. Thanks for taking our question. First one for me is on RevPAR in April, obviously, very strong. Can you provide some additional color on that strength, how that number came in maybe versus your expectations and kind of the puts and takes that impacted the month with Easter shifting out and Passover standing alone. Thanks.\n\nDennis Craven: Yes, this is Dennis. I think listen, it starts with our tech hotels with RevPAR up essentially 12% in April for those five hotels. That obviously is a strong performer. But I think in general, we saw kind of some encouraging trends across our portfolio outside of what I would call, again, the leisure markets, more BT driven. Washington, D.C. has been -- has performed very well for us. We've got three hotels in that area as we talked about the embassy suites there did really well despite being under renovation for most of the quarter. And our New York suburban hotels also showed some pretty good growth. So it really starts with the tech hotels and just continues with just overall demand strength from the BT business traveler. And that's, I think, what we're hopeful that we continue to see, as Jeff talked about. We do have -- the booking window is very low, or very short at the moment, and it's hard to go out there with a pretty aggressive number. So we're encouraged by what we saw in April, especially on the weekday travel front. And I think if we can see the same thing here in May as rates really start to ramp up, then hopefully we deliver a pretty good quarter.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, very helpful. And then maybe switching gears on the Los Angeles market, any thoughts overall on that market, what's driving the underperformance relative to your expectations that you mentioned, and kind of your outlook or what needs to happen in that market to get back to 2019?\n\nDennis Craven: Yes, I mean it was up until really kind of the last six months it was one of our strongest markets I think. It had a soft fourth quarter and soft first quarter some of that was weather-driven, but as we've talked about I think it's more of an LA focus. There just isn't a ton of business travel into the market at the moment. We are starting to see some signs of life there, especially at our Woodland Hills and Marina Del Rey hotels. I think as we talked about our Anaheim Residence Inn had a great first quarter. So it's really that BT travel into downtown and up near Warner Center.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, very helpful. Thank you for all the color. That's all for me.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we have no additional questions. I would like to turn the floor back to Jeff Fisher for any closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey Fisher: Well, thanks everybody for being on the call again. And I think I'll just pick up from where Dennis left off saying that as we look at the guidance given for the second quarter and the rest of the year. We certainly are, I think, on the conservative side, but we are taking a wait and see attitude for the most part as to the kind of RevPAR results that we might see through the quarter and the rest of the year, but we are very encouraged by April numbers. We're very encouraged by strength we've seen already into May, and we will continue to push the envelope, as I said in my prepared remarks, on all fronts to continue to propel these earnings and FFO for the company. Thanks for listening.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023, which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance, driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition, we delivered net income of $272 million, a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million, an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time, comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2%, as a result of tough comparisons, the impact of Maui, and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.\"\n\nRisoleo continued, \"Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown, underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition, additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend, we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast, while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0%, based on our performance in the first quarter, the evolving nature of demand in Maui, and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution, we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.\"\n\n1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (\"FFO\") per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and comparable hotel revenues are classified as non-GAAP financial metrics according to SEC regulations. For additional details on the benefits of these supplemental measures, how they compare to the nearest GAAP equivalents, and their constraints, please consult the Financial Information Notes.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\nThe Total RevPAR for comparable hotels reached $369.58, marking a 0.5% rise from the first quarter of 2023, fueled by robust group business contributions and a rise in food and beverage revenues, with banquet and catering revenues per group room night surpassing previous highs.\n\nThe RevPAR for comparable hotels stood at $215.37 in the first quarter of 2024, down by 1.2% from the same period in 2023, affected by the Maui wildfires, unusual weather conditions across various markets, and renovation delays. The first quarter of 2023 had seen a surge in leisure demand, making for tough comparisons.\n\nGAAP net income was $272 million for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 6.5% from the first quarter of 2023, mainly due to a drop in asset sale gains, somewhat mitigated by insurance settlement gains. The GAAP operating profit margin improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%.\n\nComparable hotel EBITDA reached $435 million for the first quarter of 2024, a 2.9% decline from the first quarter of 2023, with the EBITDA margin decreasing by 140 basis points to 31.2%. Increased wages and insurance costs contributed to this decline.\n\nAdjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for the first quarter of 2024, an 8.8% increase from 2023, boosted by strong performance at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed for the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian, and the inclusion of business interruption gains.\n\nTo date, the Company has received $263 million in insurance proceeds from the expected $310 million for costs associated with Hurricane Ian damages and disruptions. Of these, $31 million was received in the first quarter, with $10 million recognized as a business interruption gain.\n\nSubsequent Acquisition:\n\nOn April 15, 2024, the Company purchased the full ownership of two hotels in Nashville: the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and the 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown, for a total of $530 million. Both LEED Silver\u00ae certified, these hotels are located in a complex within Nashville's Lower Broadway district, near the Music City Convention Center and other popular sites. The complex includes seven dining options, a spa, two fitness centers, a yoga studio, and 33,000 square feet of shared meeting space.\n\nMaui Update:\n\nThe ongoing effects of the Maui wildfires from August 2023 continued into 2024. In the first quarter, the Company's Maui properties and golf courses negatively impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. The operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were also affected, decreasing by about 50 and 30 basis points respectively. The first quarter impact is less than anticipated as Maui was expected to add 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the absence of renovation disruptions at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023, leading to a total estimated impact of 310 basis points on first quarter RevPAR.\n\nBALANCE SHEET:\n\nThe Company maintains a strong balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024, including:\n\nNet borrowing of $215 million from the revolving credit facility.\n\nThe recent $530 million purchase of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown.\n\nThe repayment of $400 million 3\u215e% Series G senior notes upon their maturity on April 1, 2024.\n\nThe distribution of a first quarter common stock dividend totaling $141 million in April 2024.\n\nFollowing these activities, the Company projects its financial balances as indicated below:\n\nTotal assets of $11.8 billion.\n\nDebt balance of $4.0 billion, with a weighted average maturity of 4.3 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%.\n\nTotal available liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion, including furniture, fixtures, and equipment escrow reserves of $231 million and $1.3 billion available under the revolver portion of the credit facility, with an adjusted cash balance of $193 million after subsequent transactions.\n\nDIVIDENDS:\n\nThe company issued a cash dividend of $0.20 per common stock share on April 15, 2024, to shareholders registered as of March 28, 2024. Any future dividends, including special dividends, will depend on the approval of the Board.\n\nHOTEL BUSINESS MIX UPDATE:\n\nThe Company's clientele is segmented into transient, group, and contract business, which accounted for about 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, of its 202", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [],

And welcome to The Marcus Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lauren, and I will be your operator for today [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Joining us today are Greg Marcus, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chad Paris, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of The Marcus Corporation. At this time, I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Paris for his opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChad Paris: Thanks, Lauren. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 first quarter conference call. I need to begin by stating that we plan to make a number of forward-looking statements on our call today, all of which we intend to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Our forward-looking statements may generally be identified by our use of words such as we believe, anticipate, expect or words of similar import. Our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected. Listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties, which could impact our ability to achieve our expectations identified in our forward-looking statements are included under the heading Forward-Looking Statements in the press release we issued this morning announcing our fiscal 2024 first quarter results and in the Risk Factors section of our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K, which you can access on the SEC's Web site.\n\nWe will also post all Regulation G disclosures when applicable on our Web site at marcuscorp.com. The forward-looking statements made during this conference call are only made as of the date of this conference call, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. In addition, we routinely post news releases and other information regarding developments at our company that impact our investors, customers, vendors and other stakeholders. You should look at our Web site, marcuscorp.com, as an important source of information regarding our company. We also refer you to the disclosures we provided in today's earnings press release regarding the use of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure used in evaluating our performance and its limitations.\n\nA reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure is provided in today's release. All right. With that behind us, let's begin. This morning, I'll start by spending a few minutes sharing the results from our first quarter with you and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity. And then I'll turn the call over to Greg, who will focus his prepared remarks on where our businesses are today and what we are seeing ahead. We'll then open up the call for questions. This morning, we reported a quarter in which we expected to face significant headwinds. The first quarter is always a seasonally challenging quarter with slower leisure travel at our Midwestern hotels during the winter months and what is often a lighter movie slate coming out of Hollywood.\n\nIn addition to the normal seasonality, this year, we knew we would face content supply challenges resulting from the prolonged movie production shutdown during last year's Hollywood strikes. With these challenges in mind, our teams were focused on closely managing our operations and the things that we can control. Our first quarter results were mixed in our two segments. Our hotel division delivered revenue, RevPAR and earnings growth on continued strength in our group business. While our theaters division was negatively impacted by the weaker film slate with significantly lower attendance, we managed expenses well on the lower revenues. I'll start with a few highlights from our consolidated results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consolidated revenues of $138.5 million decreased $13.7 million or 9% compared to the prior year quarter, with revenue growth in our hotels and resorts division offset by the revenue decrease in our theater division.\n\nOperating loss for the quarter was $16.7 million, a decline of $7.7 million compared to the prior year quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $2.3 million, a decrease of $7.2 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our segment results. I'll start this morning with our hotels and resorts division. Revenues were $57.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of 2.5% compared to the prior year. Total revenue before cost reimbursements at our 7 owned hotels increased over $1.7 million or 3.8% over the first quarter of fiscal 2023. RevPAR for our comparable owned hotels grew 2.1% during the first quarter compared to the prior year, which resulted from an overall occupancy rate increase of 2.9 percentage points, partially offset by a 3.4% decrease in our average daily rate, or ADR.\n\nOur average fiscal 2024 first quarter occupancy rate for our owned hotels was 53.7%. The decrease in ADR resulted from an increase in our group rooms as a percentage of our overall room mix with growth in midweek group rooms sold, which generally increases occupancy at lower rates. Group rooms increased to 34.5% of our total room mix during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 28.9% in the prior year quarter. In addition, improved revenue management during slower weeks and midweek nights in the first quarter resulted in growing occupancy and RevPAR at lower daily rate offerings to optimize overall rooms revenue. Our success in growing group business and better revenue management was evident in our performance relative to our peers. According to data received from Smith Travel Research, comparable competitive hotels in our markets experienced effectively flat RevPAR growth of 0.1% for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, indicating that our hotels outperformed their competitive set by 2.3 percentage points.\n\nWhen comparing our RevPAR results to comparable upper upscale hotels throughout the United States, the upper upscale segment experienced an increase in RevPAR of 2.0% during our first quarter compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, indicating that our hotels performed in line with the industry nationally. With the continued growth in group business and events, our banquet and catering operations continue to grow, with food and beverage revenues up 6.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. Finally, hotels adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, an improvement of approximately $400,000 compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to theaters. Our first quarter fiscal 2024 total revenue of $81.3 million decreased 15.7% compared to the prior year first quarter.\n\nComparable theater admission revenue decreased 13.8% over the first quarter of 2023, with comparable theater attendance decreasing 17.5%. Our first fiscal quarter began on December 29 and ended on March 28, and thus included three days between the holidays, but excluded the opening weekend of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire at the end of March. When comparing our results to other exhibitors or industry data sources such as Box Office Mojo for the first quarter, it's important to note that the domestic box office decrease first calendar quarter was approximately 3.3 percentage points better than the domestic box office decrease for the comparable weeks in our first fiscal quarter. When using our comparable fiscal weeks according to data received from Comscore and compiled by us to evaluate our fiscal 2024 first quarter results, US box office receipts decreased 9% during our fiscal 2024 first quarter compared to US box office receipts during our fiscal 2023 first quarter, indicating that our performance lagged the industry by approximately 4.8 percentage points.\n\nWe believe that our lower box office performance during the first quarter was primarily attributable to two factors, first, the biggest film of the quarter, Dune: Part Two, played exceptionally well on IMAX screens, resulting in IMAX screens taking market share from our UltraScreen and SuperScreen PLF formats in certain markets. While we believe the overall customer experience on our PLF screens with recliner seating, laser projection and Dolby Atmos sound is second to none, the market and promotion approach for this film negatively impacted our PLF market share this quarter. We also believe the IMAX significant outperformance was unique to Dune and its distribution strategy as we saw a return to historical norms for PLF market share on Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.\n\nIn addition, we believe this dynamic was amplified in a quarter without many other big films playing on PLFs. And given our high penetration of PLFs across our circuit, we tend to outperform in periods when there is a greater supply of PLF content. Second, the total box office in our top seven markets underperformed the overall decrease in the national box office. We believe this is attributable to an unfavorable film mix that was light on family content and due to the stronger relative performance of Dune in markets where we do not have a presence. Our average admission price increased by 4.9% during the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to last year. The increase in our admission per caps was primarily due to strategic pricing actions taken during fiscal 2023, which were partially offset by a decrease in the percentage of 3D ticket sales during the first quarter of '24 compared to the first quarter last year, which was favorably impacted by high 3D ticket sales from Avatar: The Way Of Water.\n\nOur average concession food and beverage revenues per person at our comparable theaters increased by 0.8% during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily due to inflationary pricing changes implemented during 2023 and was partially offset by a decrease in the number of concession items purchased per customer, which we believe is the result of fewer blockbuster films in the quarter, which tend to result in larger average purchase sizes as customers make a bigger event out of going to see the bigger films. Our top 10 films in the quarter represented approximately 62% of the box office in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 71% for the top 10 films in the first quarter last year.\n\nThe less concentrated film slate resulted in an approximately 3 percentage point decrease in overall film cost as a percentage of admission revenues. On the lower revenues, theater division adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $6.2 million compared to $13.8 million in the prior year quarter. Given the soft film slate, we closely managed operating hours and labor throughout the quarter. Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was a use of cash of $15.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to cash used by operations of $7.7 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase in cash used primarily due to the lower EBITDA. As a reminder, our cash flow from operations in the first quarter is historically impacted by seasonal changes in working capital resulting from the slowdown in our businesses following the peak holiday season and by the timing of various year-end accounts payable and compensation payments.\n\nTotal capital expenditures during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $15.4 million compared to $8.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. A large portion of our capital expenditures during the first quarter were invested in renovation projects in the hotel business at The Pfister Hotel and Grand Geneva Resort & Spa, with the balance going to maintenance projects in both businesses. Our capital investments and renovation projects have progressed as planned, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 of $60 million to $75 million, recognizing that the timing of several of our planned expenditures are still just estimates at this time. We are still finalizing the scope and timing of various projects and the actual timing of these projects will impact our final capital expenditures number for the year.\n\nWe will update our capital expenditure estimates as the year progresses. In addition to our capital expenditures, during the first quarter, we also invested approximately $4 million in a joint venture that acquired the Loews Minneapolis Hotel, a 251-room full-service luxury hotel that Greg will discuss further. This investment and our ability to execute on this deal is a great example of the flexibility and strategic advantage that our strong balance sheet and liquidity provide, making us an attractive asset buyer to sellers in allowing us to move quickly when attractive investment opportunities become available. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the first quarter with $17 million in cash and over $237 million in total liquidity with the debt to capitalization ratio of 27% and net leverage of 1.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\n\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGreg Marcus: Thanks, Chad. Good morning, everyone. We entered the year with a mixed short-term outlook in our two businesses. In hotels, we saw a continuing trend of strong group bookings, an overall healthy economy with steady travel demand, significant events and demand drivers in our markets and several recently renovated properties in our portfolio with strong positioning in their markets. By contrast, in theaters, we know we would have to navigate a short-term content supply disruption resulting from the shutdown of movie production during the 2023 Hollywood strikes that would likely create challenges for several quarters. As I shared on our last call, January and February got off to a slow start. And while I'm happy to share that March was better, it was still a tough quarter for the movies.\n\nWe anticipated these short-term challenges in our industry, and we manage the business accordingly. While the comparisons to last year are certainly tough, the overall company first quarter results are actually slightly better than what we expected. We often get asked why we have these two different businesses. And this quarter, along with the last several years, have really illustrated the benefits of our diversified business model that can provide a counterbalance when we encounter periodic bumps in one of our businesses. While the short-term expectations for our theater and hotel divisions are going to differ this year, our long-term outlook for both businesses remains positive and optimistic, and we expect growing momentum in the back half of the year.\n\nI'll start today with our hotel and resorts division. You've seen the segment numbers, and Chad shared some additional detail on the performance metrics, including our outperformance to the comp sets and our in-line performance with upper upscale hotels nationally. As we've discussed in past years, there is significant seasonality in our hotel business, given that most of our company-owned hotels are located in the Midwest. We often lose money in this division during the winter months. And in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we were at breakeven EBITDA, an improvement over our prior year EBITDA loss. There were a few notable trends in the quarter that I would like to highlight. I'll start with what we're seeing with average daily rates. Our average daily rates were down 3.4% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year, and the drivers of this are due to three factors; changes in our mix of business, changes in revenue management strategy and some market softening.\n\nI'll start with our mix of business. In the first quarter of 2024, group room revenue was over 34% of our overall mix of business compared with 29% of our mix last year. While group business is typically at lower rates and is dilutive to ADR, it allows us to grow midweek occupancy and is accretive to our overall RevPAR. In addition, the strength of our group business provides growth to our banquet and catering business, which grew 6.4% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter last year. Secondly, we continue to refine and optimize revenue management. During the first quarter at select hotels, we adjusted our strategy to sell rooms at lower daily rates during low demand periods to drive occupancy and maximize revenue with our available room night capacity.\n\nThis approach was particularly effective during the winter months when demand is seasonally low, and we were more aggressive on rates this year than we were last year. The net result was successful in growing our occupancy and overall RevPAR. Finally, we did see some general rate softening in the quarter at some of our properties. One quarter does not make a trend and the winter months are typically weak demand to begin with, but we do expect moderating ADR growth rates compared to last year, and we will continue to monitor the trend. RevPAR grew in three of our seven owned hotels with average daily rate growth at two hotels and occupancy growth at four out of seven hotels, resulting in overall RevPAR growth of 2.1%. Group business remains strong, and we're doing a great job capturing our share of group business.\n\nWe have previously shared with you the strength in our group bookings over the last several quarters, and we're seeing that coming through the results. The bookings continue to look strong with our group room revenue bookings for the remainder of fiscal 2024, or group pace in the year, for the year, running approximately 23% ahead of where we were at this time last year. At approximately 11% of where we were at this time last year, excluding the impact of the upcoming Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer. Even more encouraging, our group pace for fiscal 2025 is running over 60% ahead of where we were at this time last year. Banquet and catering pace for the remainder of fiscal '24 and '25 is similarly ahead of where we were at this time last year.\n\nChad mentioned our investments in renovations in our owned hotels this quarter. One benefit of our seasonality and slower winter months is it gives us an opportunity to complete these projects with limited disruption to hotel operations. We continue to make great progress on our renovation projects with most of the updated ballrooms and meeting space at Grand Geneva now back in service and the guest room renovation of the historic tower at The Pfister Hotel on track for completion in June. The updated spacing rooms look great, and our team has done a fantastic job executing these large and complex projects. As our hotel division heads into the busier spring and summer travel months, we are excited by what we see ahead. The investments we are making in our properties puts us in a great position to win in our markets.\n\nAnd of course, the Republican National Convention in July will be great for the entire city of Milwaukee and we're excited to showcase our wonderful community. Last quarter, I shared an update on our growth strategy in hotels and briefly commented on our pending acquisition of the Loews Minneapolis Hotel. Our joint venture closed on the hotel acquisition on March 1, and our team hit the ground running, taking over management of the hotel and executing our repositioning strategy for this property. The luxury lifestyle hotel was rebranded as The Lofton, a Tapestry Collection by Hilton Hotel. It was part of the Hilton reservation system on day 1 of our ownership and management. We will continue to make improvements at the hotel over the next year to create value and turn around what we believe is a property with great potential.\n\nTurning to theaters. Chad went over the numbers with you, including our continued increases in per person revenues. The beginning of the first quarter got off to a very different start than what we experienced last year when the industry benefited from strong holds on carryovers, Avatar: The Way of Water and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. In fact, Avatar was the number one movie for the first 5 weeks of our fiscal 2023. While there were a number of good films in theaters over the holidays to continue to play into the new year, we didn't have a single blockbuster like Avatar that held as long and performed as strong in January this year. In terms of the quantity of wide-release films in the first quarter, we had a similar number of titles with 24 wide releases in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 23 in the first quarter last year.\n\nHowever, the first quarter slate this year was weaker overall, with lesser performances and fewer blockbuster films with no films in the first quarter opening over $100 million. And with an average opening weekend US box office gross per wide release film that was 25% lower than the same average in the first quarter last year. We believe this was another side effect of last year's Hollywood strikes with bigger titles getting pushed out on the film slate as a result of the moving production shutdown. And smaller films getting wide releases that would have normally been limited releases if the product supply were stronger. There were a few bright spots in the quarter with Dune: Part Two exceeding industry expectations and delivering on its potential, and Bob Marley: One Love surprising with a strong opening and a great run.\n\nChad shared some of the market share dynamics that we believe impacted our market share on Dune with the film significantly outperforming on IMAX screens nationally, which only represents 3 of our 125 premium large-format screens. As Chad discussed, the IMAX performance on this film does appear to be unique to Dune and its distribution strategy as we saw a return to a more typical PLF market share with Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Chad also noted that our PLF strategy particularly benefits us when there are multiple significant films in the market at the same time. Our admission per caps were up 4.9% in the first quarter, and we were able to overcome the headwind from the high percentage of 3D tickets on Avatar last year. However, as we look forward, we expect our admission per cap growth rate to flatten as we have passed the 1-year anniversary of the pricing changes to our Value Tuesday promotion that we made in March last year.\n\nWe will continue to review our regular non-Tuesday ticket prices in our markets to ensure we remain competitive and offer attractive value to all types of customers. This will be increasingly important as we work to incentivize customers to maintain the habit of moviegoing during periods of product gaps in the release calendar. In April, we were with our theater team at CinemaCon, and there were a few things I took away from this year's conference, first and most importantly, our studio partners. Film directors and talent all continue to reaffirm the importance of theatrical exhibition to the overall filmed entertainment ecosystem and our role in elevating their content. Second, we got a closer look at the film slate for the rest of the year and into 2025.\n\nAnd as we move past the supply chain issues from the strikes, there is a lot to be excited about with several great titles this summer and later this year that look really good, and we expect a strong -- a much stronger slate for 2025. The summer movie season kicks off tomorrow with the opening of The Fall Guy and is followed by a number of big titles, including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Inside Out 2, Horizon: An American Saga, A Quiet Place: Day One, Despicable Me 4, Twisters and Deadpool & Wolverine. This fall, we are excited about Beetlejuice, Joker: Folie a Deux, Saw XI and Venom: The Last Dance. For the holidays, we look forward to Gladiator II, Moana 2, Wicked, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, Kraven the Hunter, Mufasa and Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\nWe continue to project 95 to 100 wide release films for 2024. As we look to next year, 2025, we'll feature several strong franchises, including Superman, Fast & Furious, Captain America, Mission: Impossible, Jurassic World, Karate Kid, The Fantastic Four, Snow White, Wicked 2 and Avatar 3, just to name a few. We've always taken a long-term view of managing our businesses. And as we look at the product supply ramping back up to and potentially exceeding 2023 levels in 2025, we remain very positive and optimistic about the long-term future for the industry and our theater business. Finally, I'd like to once again express my appreciation for our dedicated associates of The Marcus Corporation. Their outstanding work and commitment to serving our customers is responsible for our success, and we appreciate all that they do every day.\n\nThey are our most important asset. So on behalf of our Board of Directors and our entire executive team, thank you to all of our associates. And with that, at this time, Chad and I would be happy to open up the call for any questions you may have.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The details were disclosed in their recent 8-K filing.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nChatham Lodging Trust operates across the U.S., focusing on states like California, New York, and Texas, among others. The company's portfolio primarily consists of upscale extended-stay hotels and premium-branded, select-service hotels, operating under well-known brands such as Hilton, Marriott, and Hyatt. The majority of Chatham's revenue is generated from room sales, supplemented by food and beverage and other miscellaneous sources.\n\nFinancial Performance Highlights\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 saw Chatham Lodging Trust reporting a net loss of $5.5 million, a slight increase from the $5.0 million loss recorded in the same period last year. Despite this, the adjusted Funds From Operations (FFO) per share stood at $0.16, aligning with the previous year and surpassing analyst estimates of $0.16 per share for the quarter. Total revenue figures were not explicitly mentioned in the earnings release, but the company highlighted a 2% increase in Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) to $120, driven by a 1% increase in Average Daily Rate (ADR) and a 1% rise in occupancy.\n\nOperational and Market Performance\n\nChatham's operational strategy has yielded notable successes, particularly in technology-driven markets. The Silicon Valley and Bellevue hotels experienced a significant 17% increase in RevPAR. The overall portfolio's RevPAR for April 2024 also saw a 5% increase year-over-year. This performance underscores the strategic positioning of Chatham's properties in high-growth areas, capitalizing on the resurgence in business travel, especially in tech-centric locations.\n\nStrategic Financial Management\n\nChatham has continued to strengthen its balance sheet through strategic dispositions and prudent financial management. The sale of the Hilton Garden Inn Denver Tech Center for $18 million earlier this year is a testament to this strategy, allowing the company to avoid a $6 million renovation cost. Moreover, Chatham's net debt to trailing twelve-month EBITDA ratio stood at a healthy 4.0 times, highlighting its solid financial footing and operational efficiency.\n\nOutlook and Future Plans\n\nLooking ahead, Chatham Lodging Trust remains optimistic about its performance in 2024, driven by strong fundamentals in its major markets and no significant renovations planned for the second quarter. The company's guidance reflects a strategic focus on maintaining operational efficiency and capitalizing on market opportunities to drive further growth and profitability.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nChatham Lodging Trust's first quarter results for 2024 reflect a company that is navigating the complexities of the real estate and hospitality sectors with strategic acumen and operational efficiency.

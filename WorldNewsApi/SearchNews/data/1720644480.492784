{"id": 231214230, "title": "Rahul Gandhi: hope in defeat for India opposition figurehead", "text": "The son, grandson and great-grandson of former prime ministers, Rahul Gandhi was seen as India\u2019s next leader in waiting when he made his foray into politics in 2004. Two decades on, the 53-year-old opposition Congress party leader recorded his greatest success so far: a 140-odd-seat defeat at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In normal political circumstances, it would rank as an electoral humiliation, but compared to the BJP landslides of 2014 and 2019, it is a stunning turnabout. On Saturday, he was nominated to be India\u2019s official opposition in parliament. The once-dominant Congress had withered under his stewardship, and expectations were already low even before exit polls predicted another crushing win for the BJP. Instead, a relaxed Gandhi held up a little red book at his party headquarters on Tuesday and proclaimed that the voters \u201chave taken the first and the biggest step to save the constitution of this country\u201d. Congress has struggled to present a coherent alternative vision to the BJP\u2019s Hindu-first agenda, while Gandhi has been hamstrung by several criminal cases lodged against him by BJP members, including a defamation conviction that saw him briefly disqualified from parliament last year. He has struggled to shed his image of an entitled princeling, while his often lacklustre oratory skills are overshadowed by the populist appeal of his politically battle-hardened rival Modi. But in 2022, Gandhi sought to change his public reputation, presenting what he said was his real self by embarking on a cross-country trek to hear the concerns of ordinary voters. A bachelor, he argued that India\u2019s media had expended time and money in portraying him in a manner \u201cwhich is just untruthful and wrong\u201d and insisting that his \u201ctruth is different\u201d. The Congress showing at the polls was \u201ca convincing performance\u201d, said Nistula Hebbar, political editor of The Hindu newspaper, and \u201cdefinitely a big victory for Rahul Gandhi\u201d. \u201cHe has been trolled a lot in the past and has been made a figure of ridicule,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy should get the marks just for being persistent.\u201d No relation to independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, Rahul was born in 1970 when his grandmother Indira Gandhi \u2013 daughter of India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru \u2013 was prime minister. In 1991, when he was 20, his father Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a Tamil suicide bomber, seven years after Indira was shot dead by her bodyguards. Rahul, who was then at Harvard University, dropped out. He later graduated from Rollins College in Florida, before going on to earn a master\u2019s degree from Cambridge. After a stint as a management consultant in London, he returned to India to join the Congress party \u2013 then helmed by his Italian-born mother Sonia \u2013 and was subsequently elected to parliament. Despite once comparing power to poison, Rahul formally took over the reins of the party from his mother in 2017. Regularly fumbling while delivering speeches in Hindi, Rahul was dubbed \u201cpappu\u201d, or witless, by Modi. The Congress party, which dominated politics for decades after independence, was repeatedly humbled. In the 2019 general election, Rahul lost his formerly safe seat of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh to rising BJP star Smriti Irani. He is no longer officially the Congress party president, but remains by far its highest-profile leader. Analysts say Rahul\u2019s job is unenviable: Modi\u2019s government has been widely accused of tipping the scales in his favour. Rahul was convicted of criminal libel last year and briefly disqualified from parliament after a complaint by a member of Modi\u2019s party. His two-year prison sentence was suspended by a higher court but he faces several other defamation cases. Congress\u2019 bank accounts were frozen by the tax department this year, with Rahul telling reporters the elections were \u201cnot a level playing ground\u201d and that India was no longer a functional democracy. Hartosh Singh Bal, political editor of The Caravan magazine in New Delhi, said this week\u2019s result \u201cmeans that he will be taken with greater political seriousness\u201d. But he cautioned, \u201cvictory is in the limited sense of the word that the BJP fell short of where it was expected to be\u201d.", "summary": "Gandhi has sought to change his reputation in recent years and Congress\u2019 showing at the polls is \u2018definitely a big victory\u2019 for him, analysts say.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3265906/rahul-gandhi-hope-defeat-india-opposition-figurehead", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/08/bebb4986-4a5e-4312-802d-39445ebd06e2_9ccd9ec8.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:00:14", "author": "Agence France-Presse", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.15}

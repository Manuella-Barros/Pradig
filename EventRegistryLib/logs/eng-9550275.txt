The legislation would require Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) coordinators at both the U.S. Departments of State and Defense to engage with the Japanese government, and consult with counterparts in the U.K and Australia, to discuss what including Japan in certain advanced technology cooperation activities under the AUKUS framework would look like.\n\n\"Amid China's growing military and technological threats to the free and open Indo-Pacific, it is imperative that we find ways to include Japan in the AUKUS partnership among the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia,\" said Senator Hagerty. \"I'm proud to support this important bipartisan bill that seeks to lay the groundwork for Japan -- as one of America's most important allies, the world's third-biggest economy, and a global technological leader -- to join AUKUS and contribute to this strategic partnership's Pillar Two efforts to collaborate, develop, and deploy artificial intelligence, quantum computing, hypersonics, and other advanced technologies.\"\n\n\"The United States must link arms with its allies to effectively push back against increased Chinese aggression -- especially as the Chinese Communist Party ramps up its military activities in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, and South China Sea,\" said Senator Romney. \"Our legislation will take an important step toward determining how Japan, a close and capable ally, could bolster the AUKUS partnership in order to strengthen our technological edge and counter China's malign rise and aggression in the region.\"\n\n\"China and Russia simply cannot compete with the strength of the United States' alliances,\" said Senator Kaine. \"I have been a strong advocate of the Australia-U.K.-U.S. (AUKUS) partnership, which is critical to keeping the Indo-Pacific free and open amid growing instability in the South China Sea. I'm proud to introduce this bipartisan bill to help us outline a path for Japan's inclusion in AUKUS and expand defense industrial cooperation among U.S. allies. We must work together to address our shared challenges.\"\n\n\"Japan is a close ally and logical first partner for potential expansion of AUKUS given its large, technologically advanced economy and substantial manufacturing capacity,\" said Senator Risch. \"However, AUKUS should get up and running before the administration decides to add a new partner. This legislation requires the administration to first engage Japan on its interest in cooperation on pillar two of AUKUS, including assessments of its unique technological contributions and whether its export control system is sufficiently aligned to that of the existing AUKUS partners. Importantly, it also ensures the executive branch consult with its counterparts in the United Kingdom and Australia before expanding AUKUS.\"\n\nBackground:\n\nThe Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) trilateral partnership, announced in September 2021, was a historic step toward increased cooperation between the U.S. and its allies to deter aggression and maintain stability around the world.\n\nPart of the AUKUS agreement envisioned deeper collaboration among AUKUS partners on advanced military capabilities -- including cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum, and more -- to support innovation, improve technology sharing, and develop vital new defense and security applications. In April 2024, AUKUS partners announced they would consider cooperating with Japan on AUKUS-related advanced technology projects.\n\nThe Coordinating AUKUS Engagement with Japan Act operationalizes this announcement by directing the two AUKUS coordinators at the U.S. Departments of State and Defense to engage with Japan, and consult with counterparts in the U.K. and Australia, at technical level to better understand how Japan could augment the partnership and what steps Japan might need to take in order to engage quickly and meaningfully in AUKUS advanced technology projects. Additionally, the administration would be required to provide a briefing and a report to Congress detailing these engagements, areas where Japan could add value to AUKUS, a plan for engaging Japan on AUKUS cooperation moving forward, and feedback provided by Australia and the United Kingdom.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"},

The legislation would require Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) coordinators at both the U.S. Departments of State and Defense to engage with the Japanese government, and consult with counterparts in the U.K and Australia, to discuss what including Japan in certain advanced technology cooperation activities under the AUKUS framework would look like.\n\n\"The United States must link arms with its allies to effectively push back against increased Chinese aggression -- especially as the Chinese Communist Party ramps up its military activities in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, and South China Sea,\" Senator Romney said. \"Our legislation will take an important step toward determining how Japan, a close and capable ally, could bolster the AUKUS partnership in order to strengthen our technological edge and counter China's malign rise and aggression in the region.\"\n\n\"China and Russia simply cannot compete with the strength of the United States' alliances. I have been a strong advocate of the Australia-U.K.-U.S. (AUKUS) partnership, which is critical to keeping the Indo-Pacific free and open amid growing instability in the South China Sea,\" said Senator Kaine. \"I'm proud to introduce this bipartisan bill to help us outline a path for Japan's inclusion in AUKUS and expand defense industrial cooperation among U.S. allies. We must work together to address our shared challenges.\"\n\n\"Japan is a close ally and logical first partner for potential expansion of AUKUS given its large, technologically advanced economy and substantial manufacturing capacity. However, AUKUS should get up and running before the administration decides to add a new partner,\" said Ranking Member Risch. \"This legislation requires the administration to first engage Japan on its interest in cooperation on pillar two of AUKUS, including assessments of its unique technological contributions and whether its export control system is sufficiently aligned to that of the existing AUKUS partners. Importantly, it also ensures the executive branch consult with its counterparts in the United Kingdom and Australia before expanding AUKUS.\"\n\n\"Amid China's growing military and technological threats to the free and open Indo-Pacific, it is imperative that we find ways to include Japan in the AUKUS partnership among the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia,\" said Senator Hagerty. \"I'm proud to support this important bipartisan bill that seeks to lay the groundwork for Japan -- as one of America's most important allies, the world's third-biggest economy, and a global technological leader -- to join AUKUS and contribute to this strategic partnership's Pillar Two efforts to collaborate, develop, and deploy artificial intelligence, quantum computing, hypersonics, and other advanced technologies.\"\n\nThe Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) trilateral partnership, announced in September 2021, was a historic step toward increased cooperation between the U.S. and its allies to deter aggression and maintain stability around the world.\n\nPart of the AUKUS agreement envisioned deeper collaboration among AUKUS partners on advanced military capabilities -- including cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum, and more -- to support innovation, improve technology sharing, and develop vital new defense and security applications. In April 2024, AUKUS partners announced they would consider cooperating with Japan on AUKUS-related advanced technology projects.\n\nThe Coordinating AUKUS Engagement with Japan Act operationalizes this announcement by directing the two AUKUS coordinators at the U.S. Departments of State and Defense to engage with Japan, and consult with counterparts in the U.K. and Australia, at technical level to better understand how Japan could augment the partnership and what steps Japan might need to take in order to engage quickly and meaningfully in AUKUS advanced technology projects. Additionally, the administration would be required to provide a briefing and a report to Congress detailing these engagements, areas where Japan could add value to AUKUS, a plan for engaging Japan on AUKUS cooperation moving forward, and feedback provided by Australia and the United Kingdom.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"},

Australia Must Address Them.", "body": "Canberra needs to win public support and maintain political unity, while making strategic calculations that factor in a realizable Plan B.\n\nThe trilateral agreement linking Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States under the banner of AUKUS faces three primary challenges: political unity, public messaging, and strategic choices.\n\nThe A$368 billion, multi-decade defense initiative is fundamental if Australia is to meet the demands of its strategic environment, which is essentially maritime. In principle, the AUKUS defense agreement's big-ticket item is delivering an Australian nuclear-powered submarine capability.\n\nOutlined in the \"optimal pathway\" announced in March 2023, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) would receive between three and five conventionally armed Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S., with the first arriving in 2032 and the next two in 2035 and 2037, with the option of purchasing an additional two if the new class of British-built AUKUS SSNs are late. The Virginias would be a mix of new and secondhand boats that would run alongside the yet-to-be-designed AUKUS SSNs from the U.K. contractor BAE, which is facing significant problems delivering the U.K.'s Astute-class SSNs and Australia's Hunter-class frigates, both of which have been beset by cost and time overruns.\n\nDespite the promises of AUKUS, the priority for American and British shipbuilders is their own submarine service, not Australia's, and this is a risk that must be considered to forestall a gaping operational capability. Moreover, the RAN's lifetime extension to its existing fleet of six Collins-class submarines to bridge the capability gap will not be underway until 2026. This is a highly complex undertaking that is likely to experience delays, potentially reducing the number of deployable submarines.\n\nTo ensure success, meaning the delivery of a critical defense capability, Australia needs to preserve political unity, win the support of the Australian taxpayer by explaining why AUKUS matters, and make strategic calculations that must factor in a realizable Plan B if AUKUS does not deliver according to the optimal pathway.\n\nLet's begin with the first challenge: cross-party political unity in Australia. Australian politics can be brutal, and party infighting has seen many prime ministers unseated by their deputies. While there is plenty that divides the Labor and Liberal parties, the incumbent Labor government under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stuck with his Liberal predecessor Scott Morrison's agreement for Australia to acquire conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines. Despite this bipartisan policy alignment, some former prominent Australian politicians are unconvinced and are openly attacking AUKUS.\n\nThe most vocal critics, former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating and his Liberal counterpart Malcolm Turnbull, have found common ground in critiquing Australia's nuclear-submarine agreement. Keating has labeled AUKUS \"the worst deal in all history\" on the grounds that Canberra could buy 40-50 conventional submarines for the same financial outlay. Turnbull has criticized the lack of a viable fallback plan if the promised boats are not delivered on the promised timeline. Both former prime ministers have also argued separately that the AUKUS legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in December 2023 contains tripwires, as the law requires U.S. presidents to certify that the sale of the Virginias will not undercut the U.S. Navy's operational requirements.\n\nAustralia has limited to no leverage over U.S. presidents, but it does over its own polity and public. Getting the policy message right is essential to sustain AUKUS' multi-decade endeavor. This does not mean tough questions should not be asked, given the massive bill that taxpayers are footing and the implications for Australia as it undertakes a strategic shift in its future defense capability. The whole-of-nation effort required for AUKUS is a heavy lift. What is required then is a government-led dialogue that is honest with the Australian public and lays out the argument for AUKUS, while acknowledging the tradeoffs with other national priorities such as in healthcare, education, or housing.\n\nIn essence, the Albanese government needs to make its case to the public about why AUKUS matters to them - now and into the future. This argument must go beyond those laid out in the Defense Strategic Review (DSR) and the recent National Defense Strategy (NDS). For instance, to win public support the government has to articulate what the threat to Australia is and why it needs to be addressed. This must be done in a way that transcends abstract arguments such as protecting sea lines of communications, which is critical but does nothing to identify the source of the threat: China.\n\nCanberra needs to articulate that we need to prepare for a potential conflict with significant geopolitical consequences. The NDS is arguably the official document that most openly discusses China's use of coercive tactics and the necessity for Australia of maintaining a region free from coercion. But the discussion about the threat China poses to Australia remains light, which is understandable. No government, including the U.S., wants to label China as an enemy lest it become an overt foe.\n\nStill, the increasing pace of strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific necessitates that Australian lawmakers foster an open dialogue with the public to cultivate a shared understanding of the strategic imperatives driving policy decisions, including the government's justification for AUKUS. Such clarity is essential for galvanizing public support for sustained investment in AUKUS. Failure to address these concerns risks eroding public trust over time and compromising Australia's ability to traverse an increasingly fraught geopolitical landscape.\n\nThe Australian government has made a strategic choice to prepare for a potential conflict with China. The DSR and NDS recommend that the Australian government adopt a strategy of denial to prevent hostile forces from accessing Australia's air and sea approaches through the development of anti-access/area denial capabilities. So, how does AUKUS generate deterrent effects, real or perceived?\n\nA reasonable argument goes something like this: First, Australian Virginia SSNs would enable U.S. SSNs to concentrate on the South China Sea and other areas of strategic importance, while the RAN's Virginias could patrol or block key chokepoints in the second island chain to deny the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy freedom of maneuver.\n\nSecond, AUKUS would allow more American and British SSNs to operate continuously as Australian ports can offer critical maintenance, meaning these boats do not have to sail back to their home ports for servicing needs. In mid-March, for instance, HMAS Stirling hosted the USS Annapolis, a Los Angeles-class attack SSN, in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nThird, Australia's ports also mean that American and British SSNs can operate closer to the theater of strategic threats and arguably be more survivable, as Australia provides strategic depth. Finally, AUKUS translates to more significant investment in critical allied industrial shipbuilding capacity, amplifying the overall direction of the allied capability to project power, develop skilled labor, and improve their strategic competitiveness.\n\nThe arguments above are credible and demonstrate a shift in Canberra's approach to strategy as one that is problem-solving oriented. Going forward, a fundamental challenge will be aligning a problem-solving approach versus an ends and means approach to strategy. A problem-solving approach must contend with the fact that problems change, because change is constant. Similarly, strategies couched in defining overarching end states inadvertently produce ambiguity and fail to align goals with budgets and capabilities. It would be a distraction to contest which approach is preferable, as both have costs and benefits. Hence, it is imperative not to see these approaches in binary terms but rather to apply the best of what they have to offer.\n\nThe following shortcomings would require advocates of either approach to work together. First, the lengthy time horizon for Australia to receive SSNs - 2032 for the first submarine and the 2040s for the AUKUS class - means that Australia's capabilities will remain limited, whereas the strategic environment will continue to change, making it harder to maintain the status quo.\n\nSecond, when delivered, the small fleet of eight SSNs is likely to be insufficient to enact the strategy of denial envisioned by the DSR and NDS. Hence, to augment the denial strategy, the Australian government's Enhanced Lethality Surface Combatant Fleet review has recommended doubling Australia's surface combatant fleet from 11 to 26 vessels. When fully implemented, this approach would allow Australia to operate its largest surface fleet since World War II, with more firepower to meet the challenges highlighted in the DSR.\n\nBut this revamp will take at least a decade and the reality is that not all surface or subsurface boats will be available for operational deployment at one time. In basic terms, these capabilities are necessary, but blocking Australia's northern approaches through the Indonesian archipelago requires significantly more firepower than the future force structure has to offer. More ships would be better, but that is not feasible given resource constraints, limited industrial capacity, and the lack of crews.\n\nSo, what can be done? The Integrated Investment Program (IIP) reflects the Australian government's problem-solving approach, as it lays out the specific capabilities the government will invest in order to operationalize the NDS. In line with the NDS, the IIP will evolve the Australian Defense Force's force structure over three-time horizons, including measures that will be taken now to contribute to deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. This includes the deployment of large fleets of uncrewed surface and subsurface vessels to generate persistent situational awareness, augmented multidomain ISR detection to enhance deterrence, and the creation of a deeper indigenous magazine depth to remain engaged in a high-intensity conflict.\n\nAnother aspect that will evolve is the role of land forces in enhancing deterrence. After all, warfare is not restricted to any single domain, and an integrated force must optimize all five domains to be credible and relevant for deterrence. As such, the land domain remains critical for building resilience, meaning the capacity to absorb lethal shocks, rebuild, and recover, as leveraging land power networks offers decision-makers more options. Options include long-range strike capabilities to keep at-risk adversaries farther away from Australian shores, and the reconstitution of maritime and human intelligence networks and capabilities as part of a multidomain ISR suite, in order to make it more challenging for Chinese land and maritime forces to gain a foothold in strategic passages that would favor their operations.\n\nSome other areas could involve running information operations where China has embedded or entered foreign institutions, building logistics networks and supply chains to ensure critical supplies are available, and advancing data sharing across allies to enable their militaries to communicate faster, more efficiently, and with fewer restrictions to enhance interoperability and realize multidomain fusion.\n\nAustralia and its Western partners have a different conception of time than the Chinese leadership, which has a long-term horizon and arguably the political will to persevere against counter currents. Recognizing the Chinese Communist Party's long game and its hybrid approach to strategy thus requires Canberra and its allies to apply a pragmatic problem-solving approach in parallel with an ends and means approach to strategy, because no single approach is fit for purpose. Western democracies have pressure-release valves through elections and other means, but their shorter-term thinking detracts from the political will to stay the course in strategic competition.\n\nAlthough the NDS recognizes that many of the capabilities will require a whole-of-government and whole-of-nation effort, the cost in terms of time means that it will be harder for Australia to advance its strategic interests and implement its strategy of denial. This reality necessitates that Australia conducts a methodical and objective analysis of its strengths and weaknesses in order to identify what behaviors from China it seeks to deter and how it seeks to achieve these deterrent effects across all domains. It would be unwise to assume the Australian public will remain agnostic about the cost outlay for AUKUS and not seek a concerted explanation of why it matters to Australia's security and why this course of action is the best way forward.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Diplomat Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But according to foreign minister Winston Peters, the government is \"a long way from this point of being able to make such a decision\".\n\nThis is puzzling. Strategy, as Prussian general and military strategist Carl von Clausewitz observed, involves a process of effectively applying means to achieve clearly defined ends.\n\nAnd the core objective of the enhanced security partnership called AUKUS has been very clear from the outset: to deter China.\n\nIn September 2021, the governments of Australia, the US and UK announced the formation of AUKUS to bolster the \"international rules-based order\" in the Indo-Pacific, to make the region \"secure, stable and resilient\".\n\nIf countering the perceived threat of China's growing assertiveness is the central purpose of AUKUS, the means to achieve this are also plain: join AUKUS. On the face of it, this should not be a particularly difficult decision. So why is it taking so long?\n\nAll about China\n\nNew Zealand's non-nuclear security policy rules out any participation in pillar one of AUKUS, which involves the delivery of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\n\nPillar two, however, envisages the sharing of cutting-edge defence technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence, hypersonic missiles and cyber warfare. In March 2023, the US indicated the door was open for more talks about New Zealand joining pillar two.\n\nSince then, the previous and current governments have been talking with AUKUS members to \"carefully weigh up the economic and security benefits and costs of any decision about whether participating in pillar two is in the national interest\".\n\nAccording to Peters, this \"will take time\". But the government must be fully aware of the major components of both pillars of AUKUS and its intended purpose. Assessing whether pillar two is in the national interest does not ultimately depend on obtaining more information about possible membership.\n\nRather, it comes down to whether the government believes it is vital to counterbalance China's increasing involvement in the Indo-Pacific and is prepared to participate in pillar two to help make that happen.\n\nWhy the wait?\n\nThere are several possible reasons for this wait-and-see approach.\n\nFirst, the government's focus on the pros and cons of pillar two membership may be due to a belief that the technology-sharing component is somehow divorced from the overarching AUKUS goal of countering China, New Zealand's biggest trade partner.\n\nHowever, it is surely a miscalculation to think partial membership of AUKUS will give the government more diplomatic wiggle room than being a full member.\n\nSecond, the government's position towards pillar two could be largely performative. Given New Zealand received the green light to explore the possibility of membership early last year, Wellington may want to be seen as leaving no stone unturned before making a decision.\n\nThe potential downsides of joining pillar two are well known. It could blur New Zealand's opposition to nuclear proliferation in the Indo-Pacific. And it could indicate to ASEAN and Pacific Island states that New Zealand's distinctive regional diplomacy had been displaced by a return to an old Anglosphere orientation.\n\nThat could also antagonise China, of course. At the same time, saying no to AUKUS too quickly could be interpreted by New Zealand's Five Eyes intelligence partners as trying to placate Beijing.\n\nIn other words, New Zealand could eventually decline membership of pillar two after a lengthy period of consideration - thus avoiding the impression Chinese pressure had forced its hand.\n\nDecision time\n\nFinally, the government may be playing the long game to prepare domestic opinion for a momentous shift in New Zealand foreign policy.\n\nUnlike the previous Labour government, it is clear the current coalition has enthusiastically linked pillar two membership to \"working more closely than ever\" with the US.\n\nWinston Peters has said there are \"powerful reasons\" for New Zealand to engage practically with security arrangements like AUKUS \"when all parties deem it appropriate\". He has also asserted AUKUS \"made a positive contribution\" to \"peace, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific\".\n\nUnderpinning the apparent push towards pillar two membership is the foreign minister's claim that the international security situation is now \"the worst that anyone today working in politics or foreign affairs can remember\".\n\nThe implication is that New Zealand needs to seek more shelter under the protective umbrella of traditional allies.\n\nWhatever the case, any decision on pillar two must be based on a clear-eyed recognition that AUKUS membership is based on the premise that China is the biggest threat to the international rules-based order - on which New Zealand depends. If Wellington does not share that view, it must say so without equivocation.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AUKUS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winston Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl von Clausewitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Otago", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Otago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prussia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberwarfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ASEAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Five Eyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglosphere"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/593267/original/file-20240509-16-shhbln.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=16%2C425%2C5417%2C2708&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550275", "eventUri": "eng-9550275", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It was well known in government circles that Rudd was micromanaging key departments and doing it badly, but Gillard was reluctant to call that spade a spade. Accordingly, NewsCorp filled the vacuum with poison, helped along by James Ashby and a few associated shysters.\n\nWhat the Albanese Government faces now is another situation without a credible narrative, but this time no one is calling it out, other than a few outliers such as former Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Turnbull, and the Emeritus Professor of Strategic Studies at the Australian National University Hugh White. The issue is AUKUS, initially a Morrison Government blank cheque deal with Britain and the US, obliging Australia to purchase eight nuclear-powered submarines by around 2040 to assist in containing an allegedly aggressive China and to keep open our sea-lane trade routes in and around the South China Sea ... in order to trade with our largest trading partner, China.\n\nExpertise in strategic studies or defence is not necessary to know that AUKUS was announced with fanfare by the Morrison Government in September 2021. It was a well-kept secret until then and announced at a time when the Labor Opposition was given less than a day to come on board with a bipartisan position or risk opposing a colossal defence policy pivot with an election six months away, and realising that opposition to it would be characterised as being weak on national security.\n\nLabor was playing a small target strategy at the time (and arguably still is) and Morrison was acutely aware of that. So without any discussion other than marketing palaver on the merits of the pivot, Labor swiftly agreed to say Yes to AUKUS while meekly mentioning a diplomatic problem entailed in cancelling a major procurement contract with France's Naval Group.\n\nThe New York Times was puzzled that Australia was 'betting the house' on a gamble that involved 'throwing its lot in with the United States for generations to come'. The Times quoted Morrison happily saying the deal was a \"forever relationship\" with a major power that could at any time be led by the likes of Donald Trump. Morrison and the then Defence Minister Peter Dutton are Trump enthusiasts so that was not an issue for them, but it might have occurred to Albanese that if a Trump presidency came to pass he would not be able to credibly argue anything like alignment between Australia's values and a hard-line 'America First' isolationist position. Defence Minister Richard Marles stepped aside from that quandary, stating recently that Kevin Rudd could deliver AUKUS under a Trump presidency, without even acknowledging values misalignment as an issue.\n\nIn London, The Times ran a story citing criticism of the deal by Turnbull and Keating which drew attention to Morrison's trademark obsession with secrecy, so much so that it involved keeping Australia's own Navy in the dark. It noted that \"a French Ministry of Defence spokesman said that Naval Group had received an official letter from the Australian Navy saying it was 'extremely satisfied that performance of the French submarine was excellent' on the same day the cancellation was announced\".\n\nBut the Australian media was uniformly gleeful about AUKUS and on board with the China phobia position advocated by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), with virtually no dissenting voices at NewsCorp, Nine, Seven, Ten or ABC News.\n\nDespite that, it was widely thought in Labor circles that if the Party won the 2022 election Albanese would quietly abandon Morrison's AUKUS frolic, especially when it calculated a cost on the proposal at around $368 billion. AUKUS had not been an election issue, so there was no voter mandate for it and the politics would always ensure that credit was given to Morrison rather than Albanese were it to prove workable, especially if NewsCorp led the reporting angle.\n\nIt was also widely hoped among Labor people that certain department secretaries and agency heads perceived as partisan, might be replaced by more neutral appointees after the election. Prominent names for the chop included Phil Gaetjens, Mike Pezzullo, Kathryn Campbell, Greg Moriarty, Ita Buttrose, Stephanie Foster, Reece Kershaw and Mike Burgess. With the exception of Gaetjens, who walked, that didn't happen because Albanese gallantly promised not to sack public servants, and he foolishly kept the promise.\n\nPredictably, the Morrison mandarins were largely free to continue implementing the agendas on which they had been working for the previous five years. It seems from the outside, for example, that Secretary Pezzullo continued to press the China war stance from Home Affairs which he had openly pushed since his \"drums of war\" speech in 2021, and to which he returned as a discredited public servant in a soft ABC 7.30 interview during April 2024 when he talked about the need for a war book.\n\nThe ABC under Buttrose was in lockstep with NewsCorp in its enthusiastic backing of AUKUS. Its Sunday morning flagship Insiders having dedicated a March 2023 program entirely to the topic, with Peter Hartcher from Nine offering his usual persuasive take and Greg Sheridan from NewsCorp bending over backwards to debunk anything negative said on the matter by White or Keating. They had contested Sheridan's mantra of China's \"radical militarism and extreme aggression\", a fixation Sheridan has obsessed about since the days of 'reds under the beds' during the 1950s and 60s.\n\nSheridan projected himself on Insiders as an AUKUS sceptic until it supposedly dawned on him that the Virginia class submarines would fill the gap before delivery of the nuclear-powered subs promise, and so he claimed to see for the first time that that extra element would ensure the wonderful strategy worked by \"complicating the thinking of any aggressor\".\n\nComplicating the thinking of an aggressor is the thinking behind a porcupine defence strategy which Keating, among others, has supported and which relies on a defence around our own maritime borders bolstered by the strategic advantage of distance. It stands in contrast to a forward strategy which involves taking an aggressive stance in China's own region with US-made submarines. A defensive strategy of \"patrol, defend, strike\" doesn't sound so defensive when \"strike\" is a key element from within striking distance of China's mainland.\n\nHartcher and Keating might agree that the AUKUS subs could end up being \"fantasy subs\" like those of the past, a point which White underlines by simply calling AUKUS a charade. He argued in the February edition of Australian Foreign Affairs that regarding nuclear powered subs as the answer is flawed on both a technical and strategic rationale, and that it's highly likely the AUKUS plan is undeliverable anyway.\n\nThe \"Second Pillar\" of AUKUS involves the promise of unprecedented research cooperation and Australian participation in contracts that will send a \"flood of work our way\", said White. But, with $368 billion of Australian taxpayer money to spend, he envisages a less naive assessment that would see our US and UK partners intent to ensure that work on their projects will be done at home, and contracted work on Australian projects will flow their way. And while Perth is being proposed as an AUKUS port, its location in the Indian Ocean does not readily fit within the idea of defending our region from China.\n\nIt's not surprising that neither Morrison nor Albanese made any attempt to put a credible narrative to the Australian people about AUKUS because any narrative would raise more troubling questions than provide sensible answers. That said, because it's a bi-partisan policy most of the electorate have never been asked to think about AUKUS. It's an issue on which the major parties agree and the mainstream media either cheer it on or steer away from it, so why would it ever come up for discussion in the public realm?\n\nWhat is surprising is that Albanese's Labor Party is pursuing a ridiculously expensive AUKUS that is putting many of its most loyal supporters offside as it sucks hundreds of billions of dollars away from programs they care about such as education, health, infrastructure, housing, gender equity and the cost of living. And all for a problematic policy position that keeps the vested interests of its political opponent happy for the time being.", "source": {"uri": "johnmenadue.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But according to foreign minister Winston Peters, the government is \"a long way from this point of being able to make such a decision\".\n\nThis is puzzling. Strategy, as Prussian general and military strategist Carl von Clausewitz observed, involves a process of effectively applying means to achieve clearly defined ends.\n\nAnd the core objective of the enhanced security partnership called AUKUS has been very clear from the outset: to deter China.\n\nIn September 2021, the governments of Australia, the US and UK announced the formation of AUKUS to bolster the \"international rules-based order\" in the Indo-Pacific, to make the region \"secure, stable and resilient\".\n\nIf countering the perceived threat of China's growing assertiveness is the central purpose of AUKUS, the means to achieve this are also plain: join AUKUS. On the face of it, this should not be a particularly difficult decision. So why is it taking so long?\n\nAll about China\n\nNew Zealand's non-nuclear security policy rules out any participation in pillar one of AUKUS, which involves the delivery of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\n\nPillar two, however, envisages the sharing of cutting-edge defence technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence, hypersonic missiles and cyber warfare. In March 2023, the US indicated the door was open for more talks about New Zealand joining pillar two.\n\nSince then, the previous and current governments have been talking with AUKUS members to \"carefully weigh up the economic and security benefits and costs of any decision about whether participating in pillar two is in the national interest\".\n\nAccording to Peters, this \"will take time\". But the government must be fully aware of the major components of both pillars of AUKUS and its intended purpose. Assessing whether pillar two is in the national interest does not ultimately depend on obtaining more information about possible membership.\n\nRather, it comes down to whether the government believes it is vital to counterbalance China's increasing involvement in the Indo-Pacific and is prepared to participate in pillar two to help make that happen.\n\nWhy the wait?\n\nThere are several possible reasons for this wait-and-see approach.\n\nFirst, the government's focus on the pros and cons of pillar two membership may be due to a belief that the technology-sharing component is somehow divorced from the overarching AUKUS goal of countering China, New Zealand's biggest trade partner.\n\nHowever, it is surely a miscalculation to think partial membership of AUKUS will give the government more diplomatic wiggle room than being a full member.\n\nSecond, the government's position towards pillar two could be largely performative. Given New Zealand received the green light to explore the possibility of membership early last year, Wellington may want to be seen as leaving no stone unturned before making a decision.\n\nThe potential downsides of joining pillar two are well known. It could blur New Zealand's opposition to nuclear proliferation in the Indo-Pacific. And it could indicate to ASEAN and Pacific Island states that New Zealand's distinctive regional diplomacy had been displaced by a return to an old Anglosphere orientation.\n\nThat could also antagonise China, of course. At the same time, saying no to AUKUS too quickly could be interpreted by New Zealand's Five Eyes intelligence partners as trying to placate Beijing.\n\nIn other words, New Zealand could eventually decline membership of pillar two after a lengthy period of consideration - thus avoiding the impression Chinese pressure had forced its hand.\n\nDecision time\n\nFinally, the government may be playing the long game to prepare domestic opinion for a momentous shift in New Zealand foreign policy.\n\nUnlike the previous Labour government, it is clear the current coalition has enthusiastically linked pillar two membership to \"working more closely than ever\" with the US.\n\nWinston Peters has said there are \"powerful reasons\" for New Zealand to engage practically with security arrangements like AUKUS \"when all parties deem it appropriate\". He has also asserted AUKUS \"made a positive contribution\" to \"peace, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific\".\n\nUnderpinning the apparent push towards pillar two membership is the foreign minister's claim that the international security situation is now \"the worst that anyone today working in politics or foreign affairs can remember\".\n\nThe implication is that New Zealand needs to seek more shelter under the protective umbrella of traditional allies.\n\nWhatever the case, any decision on pillar two must be based on a clear-eyed recognition that AUKUS membership is based on the premise that China is the biggest threat to the international rules-based order - on which New Zealand depends. If Wellington does not share that view, it must say so without equivocation.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AUKUS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winston Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl von Clausewitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Otago", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Otago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prussia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberwarfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ASEAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Five Eyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglosphere"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/593267/original/file-20240509-16-shhbln.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=16%2C425%2C5417%2C2708&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550275", "eventUri": "eng-9550275", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 452992730, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 8, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 8}}}

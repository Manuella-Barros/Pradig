The first season will start next March and run past the 2026 Winter Olympics. There will be five events, all of which will include snowboarding, with plans to include freeskiing at mid-season.\n\n\"In the end, we really want to be that premier thing, where it's amazing to go to the Olympics and win a medal, but this is like winning Wimbledon or the NBA finals. It's almost more prestigious,\" White said.\n\nThough snowboarders capture the public's imagination at certain times -- notably, the Olympics -- keeping track of the sport's biggest stars -- Chloe Kim, Scotty James and Ayumu Hirano -- has always been a chore because most halfpipe contests are standalone events with inconsistent TV and streaming schedules: Winter X Games, Dew Tour and a series of grand prix stops that aren't always interconnected.\n\nMeanwhile, White remembers competing for a $50,000 grand prize at contests in Japan when he was a kid. Those sort of prizes are more rare these days, and his league plans to bring those back, along with a bonus for riders who win the season-long standings.\n\n\"It feels very much needed right now,\" said Ian Warda, a former executive at Burton who will serve as the league's chief operating officer. \"The sport is in an interesting, transitionary phase, sort of at a critical point, where do we go from here? I couldn't be more thankful that Shaun is taking responsibility on this, and sees it as something that's important to him to foster the next generation and build a better platform.\"\n\nWhite made clear he is not trying to crowd out the X Games or any other event or tour -- only to give the sport a more reliable calendar with more lucrative cash prizes. He's also looking to make the league part of a complex Olympic qualifying process.\n\nAll of this fits in well with what White has done over his one-of-a-kind career. Starting as a teenager, he essentially created the game being played today on halfpipes around the world. For decades, snowboarders struggled with the concept of competing for big money and even Olympic medals. White made that the norm, and now that he has left the competitive side, he's hoping to give his fellow riders a bigger canvas on which to perform.\n\n\"If I can leave this sport in a better place than I found it, it would be amazing,\" White said.\n\nThe league is still locking down deals with resorts and looking for the best-possible media distribution model. The leader of US Ski & Snowboard, Sophie Goldschmidt, backs the concept.

He's won 13 X Games gold medals (and another two in skateboarding). He owns a namesake snowboard brand, Whitespace.\n\nThere's not much more a pro snowboarder could hope to accomplish. But since his retirement from the sport, White has found himself thinking about building a legacy outside his personal accomplishments -- one that could leave the sport better than it was when he competed in it.\n\nOn Monday, White announced the launch of The Snow League, the first professional winter sports league for snowboarding and freeskiing competition that he hopes will provide winter sports athletes their most straightforward opportunity to support themselves competing -- as well as a path to being crowned world champion.\n\nDebuting in winter 2025 with a five-event season, The Snow League will feature a global competition format. The league's first event in March 2025 will be held in the U.S., with the remaining four held at winter resort destinations around the world, and it will conclude after the 2026 Milano Cortina Games.\n\nThe first season will feature five men's and women's snowboard halfpipe events, with freeskiing introduced midway through the season. Down the line, the league aims to add other disciplines, such as slopestyle and big air.\n\n\"Everything we're doing is very calculated,\" White told me. \"We want to do it correct; we don't want to have to go back on something. We want to crawl before we walk before we run.\"\n\nAthletes -- the world's top 20 men and top 16 women -- will accumulate points based on their results from each event, with a world champion being crowned after the last event. Riders will be chosen via a modified ranking from the World Snowboard Points List, recognized as the definitive ranking system for competitive snowboarding globally.\n\nEach event will include a training day and two days of competition -- a qualifying day and a championship day.\n\nFor the qualifier, athletes will be seeded into four heats, with a best-of-two run format. The top qualifier from each heat will advance to the championship. The second- and third-highest scorers from each heat will enter another heat to compete for the last four championship spots.\n\nIn the championship, eight men and eight women will compete in a head-to-head bracket format with quarterfinals, semifinals and finals rounds. Seeding is based on qualifying day finishes. Athletes must win two of three runs to advance to the next round in the bracket.\n\nSandy MacDonald, Olympics head judge and competition director for several premier winter sports competitions, will serve as the league's head of competition.\n\nWhite says the seed for the idea that would eventually become The Snow League was planted in his brain many years ago, during a season in which he entered every single major competition he could -- not just in halfpipe, his primary specialty, but slopestyle and rail jams as well -- and went undefeated.\n\n\"I'd never done that before,\" White said. \"I'll never forget getting to the end of the season and getting interviewed, and this person was like, 'What an incredible accomplishment, what a season, but how does it feel not to be the world champion?' In that moment I realized there's such a disconnect in our sport -- so many big events that don't really feed into each other.\"\n\nThere is a fluctuating but overall healthy number of freestyle snowboard events on the calendar. FIS-organized Grand Prix events and, every four years, the Olympics. X Games. Dew Tour. Not to mention resurging rail jams -- Red Bull Heavy Metal, DIYX Street Jam, Red Bull Rail Yard -- and the chance to blend freestyle and freeride at Natural Selection Tour.\n\nBut the gap White has identified is a significant one. These events exist in vacuums. Most major sports have a league of some kind. They allow fans to follow storylines as they develop from game to game or stop to stop, crowning an overall winner at the end of the season.\n\nAnd sports fans truly identify with that format. Setting aside the obvious major leagues -- MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLS and the Premier League -- we've witnessed sports explode in popularity when they've been elevated in such a way that fans can follow along, develop favorite athletes and understand the stakes. Just look at Formula 1, the WNBA or the WSL.\n\n\"There is no one-stop destination for snowboarding and freeskiing,\" said The Snow League COO Ian Warda, the former VP of global integrated marketing at Burton and operator of the annual (now defunct) Burton U.S. Open.\n\n\"The content is scattered; the media landscape is very fragmented. It's hard as a fan to follow it,\" Warda added. \"Name a sport that people would recognize. Most people can start rattling off the top teams, the top players, where to watch, where to buy merch -- that ecosystem of the sport, the business around it. That doesn't really exist in snowboarding.\"\n\nAction sports is catching on, however. On June 13, X Games announced X Games League, a year-round international competition calendar with teams composed of athletes from multiple disciplines -- winter and summer -- who will compete for points to earn both individual and team prize purses.\n\nHaving retired only recently, after competing at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, White understands the athletes' experience well enough to know that this is something they're looking for in their snowboarding careers.\n\n\"I know the pain points for the athletes,\" White said. \"The need for the athletes is there; the want to do it is clear. It's bittersweet; it's a good time and place for us to be launching our league, but it's also a bitter moment for the sport that there's not more done to highlight it.\"\n\nNBC characterized its Pyeongchang 2018 men's snowboard halfpipe final broadcast, anchored by White winning his third Olympic gold medal, the \"most dominant Winter Games Tuesday night ever.\"\n\nAnd yet, White says, \"the top-viewed event at the Winter Olympics isn't having its moment after the Olympics is over.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist in halfpipe Chloe Kim said she is \"thrilled\" about The Snow League. \"It'll be great to have competitions that focus more on the athletes, giving us more opportunities to shine and do what we do best: snowboard,\" Kim said. \"I'm grateful to Shaun for giving back to the sport and his unwavering mission to uplift it.\"\n\nThe total prize purse for The Snow League's first season will be at least $1.5 million, the highest in the sport. A prize purse will be awarded at each of the season's five events as well as at the end of the season, when an additional prize will be distributed to the league's top finishers.\n\nIt's no secret that the money in snowboarding and freeskiing isn't made on the snow. Action sports athletes are largely supported by their sponsors, who often cover the costs of equipment, coaching, travel and more. An athlete might make $5,000 making a competition podium, but depending on where they're based and where the contest was held, that might barely cover travel and lodging.\n\n\"We're gonna pay the whole field; if you've qualified to get to the event, you will get compensated for being there,\" White said. As much as The Snow League is about giving the world's elite riders and skiers a premier competitive platform, White also hopes it provides a platform for the next generation of riders to break out.\n\nThe league is backed by a who's who of investors including Will Ventures, Ares Management funds, David Blitzer and Ryan Sports Ventures, with Range Sports advising on media rights and commercial partnerships strategy and execution.\n\nThe Snow League CEO Omer Atesman, a serial entrepreneur in the sports, technology, and advertising sectors, previously worked with White developing educational sports content for startup The Skills -- similar to MasterClass, with athletes.\n\nThe Snow League hasn't finalized media rights and distribution but plans to have \"premium on-site and broadcast production\" from top-tier partners. \"Everyone sees what we see; the sports have an incredible fan base, an incredible participant base,\" said Warda. \"Those ingredients lead to opportunities.\"\n\nThe Snow League aims to have linear coverage around the world as well as more access through digital, both live and on-demand. There is, as of right now, no concrete plan for a Drive to Survive-style documentary...but a photographer travels with White and the team, capturing content in meetings or in Zoom conversations with athletes.\n\n\"There will be component of storytelling in some way that goes beyond just the live broadcast, for sure,\" White said.\n\n\"One of the principles in building this is to make it more appealing to a new fan and what we would call a casual sports fan,\" Warda said. \"One of the reference points is this phenomenon of human interest storytelling in sports -- behind the scenes and under the hood, behind the goggles, sort of developing the characters of our sport. People develop a personal connection to the athletes, how they're living their lives, their struggles and triumphs.\"\n\nThe Snow League also has the potential to create a net positive impact on the lives of amateur skiers and snowboarders who may never compete at a high level.\n\nSome of the resorts the team is considering for its first season stops have permanent 22-foot halfpipes...but not all. The attendance and revenue The Snow League could generate means resorts may have the impetus and support to construct new features not only for the event but for visitors to enjoy long after.\n\n\"I think it'll inspire more halfpipes to be built at local resorts because the athletes are calling for it, and when there's a demand there's a response usually,\" White said. He also thinks it will inspire the next generation of halfpipe athletes because now there is a tour to follow.\n\n\"The Snow League really will be Shaun's biggest legacy,\" Warda said. \"Bigger than anything else he's ever done.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Launching its first season with five halfpipe events, starting March 2025 and ending winter of 2026 following the Winter Games in Milan, The Snow League has reimagined competitive formats for edge of your seat experiences broadcast worldwide from iconic winter resort destinations.\n\nWhite says \"After all my years competing in many different formats in the snowboarding space, I've come to realize that snowboarding and freeskiing athletes deserve a legit professional league. Beginning next year, The Snow League will give riders, freeskiers, and sports fans all over the world a destination for what I believe is the most exciting athletic competition in all of sports. Now is the moment to elevate the next generation of winter athletes who are pushing the limits of competition.\"\n\nThe announcement was made today at Stagwell Sport Beach at the Cannes Lions Festival in France.\n\nThe iconic snowboarder says The Snow League hopes to discover new superstars, underdogs, and fierce rivalries in the world of snowboarding and freeskiing. Fans will be able to watch the world's elite winter athletes battle during intense competition formats, with premium on-site & broadcast production.\n\nThe first season will feature men's and women's snowboard halfpipe competitions at all five events. The league plans to introduce freeskiing midway through the first season. Athletes will accumulate points based on their results from each event to be tallied together at the end of the season to crown a world champion.\n\nThe total prize purse for the first season will be at least $1.5 million, representing the richest prize purse in the sport.\n\nWhite adds \"I have so much gratitude for the rider culture that I was able to compete within. My next journey is to be a teammate, working with the best of the best to open a limitless new era for the next generation. The work it takes to compete at the highest level is something I respect.\"\n\nSports fans will be fully immersed in premiere experiences with deeper technological integration, unprecedented access, and coverage that unlocks the strategy, tactics, and stories behind victory and defeat, and will be able to watch and wager at the edge of their seat as winter's elite athletes battle to become world champion.\n\nThe Snow League's proposed schedule minimizes Olympic conflicts and maximizes global visibility for the league. For the inaugural season, the first event will take place in the U.S., followed by four events around the world.\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Chloe Kim says \"Shaun White has been a major inspiration for me ever since I decided to pursue snowboarding. I've always admired him as a competitor above all. When he called to share the news, my initial reaction was disbelief -- Shaun White is calling me?? But after listening to him share this with so much excitement, it quickly made sense; it's just the kind of thing he would do. I'm thrilled about this league. It'll be great to have competitions that focus more on the athletes, giving us more opportunities to shine and do what we do best: snowboard. I'm grateful to Shaun for giving back to the sport and his unwavering mission to uplift it.\"\n\nServing as CEO of The Snow League is Omer Atesmen, serial entrepreneur who has successfully built and sold businesses in sports, technology and advertising. Atesmen worked with White previously developing educational sports content at The Skills, and is a former Stanford engineer, Kellogg MBA and management consultant at Boston Consulting Group. Ian Warda, former VP of Global Integrated Marketing at Burton, joins as COO. During his tenure at Burton, Warda successfully planned and executed the annual Burton US Open Snowboarding Championships and developed world class event and media properties around the world while also leading strategy for brand and athlete marketing. Sandy Macdonald, Olympic judge and competition director for countless world class competitions, joins as the league's Head of Competition.\n\nSophie Goldschmidt, President and CEO of U.S. Ski and Snowboard, adds \"The Snow League is shaping up to be an incredible stage for our athletes to compete at the highest level and is a welcome addition to events like the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix series within the competitive snowboard and freeski ecosystem. We want our athletes to have the opportunity to participate in more events, consistently be introduced to newer audiences, and have the chance to achieve success at the world's best venues. U.S. Ski & Snowboard is excited for our athletes to compete in this new platform.\"\n\nThe initial round of investors in the new league include Will Ventures, Ares Management funds, David Blitzer and Ryan Sports Ventures. The Snow League has engaged Range Sports to advise on its media rights and commercial partnerships strategy and execution.\n\nCo-Founder and Managing Partner of Will Ventures, Isaiah Kacyvenski, says \"We've gotten to know Shaun and Omer over the last five years and are thrilled to partner with them on The Snow League. As investors, we're convinced that the market is primed for a premium, global action sports league.\"\n\nJim Miller, Co-Head of Ares' Sports, Media and Entertainment Strategy and U.S. Direct Lending says \"We are excited to support Shaun and Omer in this new endeavor and are confident that The Snow League will provide riders, freeskiers and sports fans all over the world with one-of-a-kind, thrilling experiences.\"\n\nHow will athletes be chosen?\n\nThe Snow League's snowboarding field will be made up of the top 20 men and 16 women in the world. Riders will be chosen using a modified ranking from the World Snowboard Points List. The WSPL is the definitive universal, transparent and fair ranking system for competitive snowboarding globally.\n\nCompetition and Season Format\n\nThe competition structure and format will be different than what has been seen before.

The first season will start next March and run past the 2026 Winter Olympics. There will be five events, all of which will include snowboarding, with plans to include freeskiing at mid-season.\n\n\"In the end, we really want to be that premier thing, where it's amazing to go to the Olympics and win a medal, but this is like winning Wimbledon or the NBA finals. It's almost more prestigious,\" White said.\n\nThough snowboarders capture the public's imagination at certain times -- notably, the Olympics -- keeping track of the sport's biggest stars -- Chloe Kim, Scotty James and Ayumu Hirano -- has always been a chore because most halfpipe contests are standalone events with inconsistent TV and streaming schedules: Winter X Games, Dew Tour and a series of grand prix stops that aren't always interconnected.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Those sort of prizes are more rare these days, and his league plans to bring those back, along with a bonus for riders who win the season-long standings.\n\n\"It feels very much needed right now,\" said Ian Warda, a former executive at Burton who will serve as the league's chief operating officer. \"The sport is in an interesting, transitionary phase, sort of at a critical point, where do we go from here? I couldn't be more thankful that Shaun is taking responsibility on this, and sees it as something that's important to him to foster the next generation and build a better platform.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhite made clear he is not trying to crowd out the X Games or any other event or tour -- only to give the sport a more reliable calendar with more lucrative cash prizes. He's also looking to make the league part of a complex Olympic qualifying process.\n\nAll of this fits in well with what White has done over his one-of-a-kind career. Starting as a teenager, he essentially created the game being played today on halfpipes around the world. For decades, snowboarders struggled with the concept of competing for big money and even Olympic medals. White made that the norm, and now that he has left the competitive side, he's hoping to give his fellow riders a bigger canvas on which to perform.\n\n\"If I can leave this sport in a better place than I found it, it would be amazing,\" White said.\n\nThe league is still locking down deals with resorts and looking for the best-possible media distribution model. The leader of US Ski & Snowboard, Sophie Goldschmidt, backs the concept. Kim, the two-time Olympic gold medalist, is among the riders White has approached who is supportive of the new league.\n\n\"It'll be great to have competitions that focus more on the athletes, giving us more opportunities to shine and do what we do best: snowboard,\" she said. \"I'm grateful to Shaun for giving back to the sport and his unwavering mission to uplift it.\"\n\nSnowboarders aren't unlike many pro athletes, in that endorsements usually make up a bigger part of their income than prize money. Still, White would like to see them holding bigger checks at the end of events they fly around the world to be part of.\n\n\"A lot of athletes are, like, 'Man, I just don't want to fly to New Zealand and participate in a competition that's going to make me $5,000 when the flight down there and the hotel costs more than that,'\" White said. \"And who is going to see it? I can post it on my social page, but that's about it.\"\n\nThe Snow League plans on bringing 20 men and 16 women to contests, which will be decided by a bracketed \"championship day,\" featuring quarterfinal, semifinal and final rounds.\n\nTags Nosnd Get the latest in your inbox!\n\nWe're delivering updates and highlights on the Summer Olympics daily to your inbox, including What to Watch,

The league declined to say how much it has raised. Isaiah Kacyvenski, co-founder and managing partner at Will Ventures and a former NFL player, said his firm led the league's seed stage round with an investment of nearly $4 million.\n\nThe league aims to fill a gap in the marketplace by providing a regular schedule for athletes and viewers between Olympics. It won't be alone in attempting to do so. The X Games, an action sports competition, announced plans last week for a \"new global, team-based format\" set to launch in 2026. Private equity firm MSP Sports Capital, which acquired the X Games from ESPN in 2022, said its league will have summer and winter editions with events ranging from snowboarding to skateboarding.\n\nWhile White has feuded with the X Games in the past, he said his new league is not intended as a rival for other snowboarding events. \"We've been trying to play as nice as possible with everybody,\" he said, \"It's important that X sticks around.\"\n\nWhite hopes to shift the image of snowboarding away from its roots as an edgy, countercultural spectacle toward a more traditional sport. Each Snow League event will be a two-day tournament, with riders competing in a group stage on the first day and head-to-head on the second, a format that the league expects will make it easy for casual fans to follow. The broadcasts, said White, will focus on explaining the various tricks and their scoring.\n\n\"I'm so excited to help usher in the era of when we will no longer be action sports,\" White said. \"It's sports, man.\"\n\nThe league's first competition will be held at a yet to-be-determined US venue, according to its Chief Operating Officer Ian Warda, with four additional events slated for the first season, including stops in Europe and Asia.\n\nAt the outset, the league plans to invite 20 men and 16 women to compete in halfpipe snowboarding, with other events such as slopestyle snowboarding and freestyle skiing to be added in future seasons. The total prize purse for the first season is $1.5 million, split evenly between men and women. The first place finishers at each event will earn $50,000. Every rider will be paid. The top three riders for the season, for both men and women, will split a $250,000 prize. It is, according to the league, the richest prize purse in the sport.\n\n\"This is just a starting point,\" said White, \"We plan on offering a lot more money in the future.\"\n\nAccording to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation's (FIS) prize money standings for the 2024 season, top earning snowboarders bring in about $30,000 to $50,000 annually from its sanctioned events. Opportunities for riders to earn prize money have dwindled in recent years. The Burton US Open, an annual competition sponsored by the snowboard maker, has not returned since being cancelled due to the pandemic in 2021. White has likewise paused the Air + Style festival, a combination live music and snowboarding series he bought in 2014, since its last event in 2019.\n\nThe Snow League has yet to find a buyer for its broadcast rights, but is in discussions with several entities, according to Chief Executive Officer Omer Atesmen. Its strategy is to partner with traditional TV networks and streaming services, he said.\n\nThe league also plans to highlight the backstories of top riders, possibly through a behind-the-scenes docuseries in the style of Formula 1's Drive to Survive or the NFL's Hard Knocks.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snowboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "X Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Blitzer_Sports_&_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winter sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Kacyvenski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Kacyvenski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seed (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaun White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Fitzgerald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Fitzgerald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counterculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private equity firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ski_and_Snowboard_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Ski and Snowboard Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Knocks_(2001_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard Knocks (2001 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopestyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slopestyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Winter_Sports/Snowboarding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Winter Sports/Snowboarding", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Software/Web_Applications", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Software/Web Applications", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2085981!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/shaun-white-celebrates-his-f-vancouver-2010-winter-olympics-photographer-streeter-lecka-getty-images.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658185", "eventUri": "eng-9658185", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The season-long halfpipe league will feature five events -- all of which will include snowboarding -- with plans to include freeskiing at mid-season.\n\nThe league will offer more than $1.5 million (\u20ac1.3 million) in prizes and aims to pull together what has long been a spread-out, confusing calendar. Most halfpipe contests are standalone events with inconsistent TV and streaming schedules: Winter X Games, Dew Tour and a series of grand prix stops that aren't always interconnected.\n\n\"We really want to be that premier thing, where it's amazing to go to the Olympics and win a medal, but this is like winning Wimbledon or the NBA finals. It's almost more prestigious,\" White said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe halfpipe legend says the idea for The Snow League was planted in his brain many years ago, during a season in which he entered every single major competition he could -- not just in halfpipe, but slopestyle and rail jams as well -- and went undefeated.\n\n\"I'd never done that before,\" White said. \"I'll never forget getting to the end of the season and getting interviewed, and this person was like, 'What an incredible accomplishment, what a season, but how does it feel not to be the world champion?' In that moment I realised there's such a disconnect in our sport -- so many big events that don't really feed into each other.\"\n\nFeaturing a global competition format, the league's first event in March 2025 will be held in the US, with the remaining four held at winter resort destinations around the world. Five men's and women's snowboard halfpipe events, with freeskiing introduced midway through the season are planned for the inaugural event, with plans to add other disciplines, such as slopestyle and big air, in the future. The world's top 20 men and top 16 women -- chosen via a modified ranking from the World Snowboard Points List -- will accumulate points based on their results from each event, with a world champion being crowned after the last event.\n\nEach event will include a training day and two days of competition: a qualifying day -- with athletes seeded into four heats, with a best-of-two run format -- and a championship day, where eight men and eight women will compete in a head-to-head bracket format with quarterfinals, semifinals and finals rounds.\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medallist Chloe Kim said she is \"thrilled\" about The Snow League.\n\n\"It'll be great to have competitions that focus more on the athletes, giving us more opportunities to shine and do what we do best: snowboard,\" Kim said. \"I'm grateful to Shaun for giving back to the sport and his unwavering mission to uplift it.\"", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karate@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Karate", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "gretelle_jimenez@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Gretelle Jimenez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_White", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaun White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-pipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Half-pipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snowboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dew Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeskiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freeskiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winter Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortina_d'Ampezzo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cortina d'Ampezzo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cortina d'Ampezzo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopestyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slopestyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Alpine_World_Ski_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIS Alpine World Ski Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chloe Kim"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Winter_Sports/Snowboarding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Winter Sports/Snowboarding", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/228915/o/Shaun+White", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658185", "eventUri": "eng-9658185", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Complete with prize money and sponsorship opportunities, the new series will be built, according to White, \"with athletes in mind first.\"\n\n\"After all my years competing in many different formats in the snowboarding space, I've come to realize that snowboarding and freeskiing athletes deserve a legit professional league,\" White said during The Snow League's announcement at the Cannes Lions Festival in France. \"The Snow League will give riders, freeskiers, and sports fans all over the world a destination for what I believe is the most exciting athletic competition in all of sports. Now is the moment to elevate the next generation of winter athletes who are pushing the limits of competition.\"\n\nDebuting in March 2025, the Snow League series will feature five events running through the winter of 2026 and will boast a combined prize purse of $1.5 million, split into $250,000 per-event and an additional $250,000 for the season champions. That's the largest prize purse ever for a snowboarding competition. While the venues have yet to be announced, the first event will be held in the United States, and the remaining four will take place abroad.\n\nThe inaugural 2025/26 season will be restricted to the snowboarding halfpipe -- one of the most-watched events at the Winter Olympic Games -- with freeskiing introduced midway through the season. However, White indicated that he plans to grow The Snow League into a multi-discipline competition series, with up to 15 events per year.\n\nThe announcement was welcome news to professional snowboarder Lucas Foster, who represented the U.S. at the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. \"The Snow League is a game-changer,\" Foster told Outside. \"It'll be an actual series with structure, big prize money, and a new format. It'll be a lot easier for fans to follow and for companies to buy into, too.\"\n\nFoster believes the new series will inject more energy into the small world of competitive snowboarding by giving professional riders more competition options. Since 1994, the world's best halfpipe snowboarders have had just one season-long series to follow: the Snowboarding World Cup. The series of events is operated by the International Ski Federation, and it comprises six different events: parallel slalom, parallel giant slalom, snowboard cross, halfpipe, slopestyle, and big air.\n\n\"The tour is pretty much the same every year, the prize money is really low, and it's hard for fans to follow,\" Foster said. \"It's just gotten so repetitive that it's almost boring for the riders and fans.\"\n\nThe Snow League is invite-only, and its participants will include the top-20 men and 16 women in the world per halfpipe rankings from the World Snowboard Points List. These 36 riders will be placed into four heats for qualifiers, ranking based on their best score out of two runs. Eight male and eight female finalists will go on to compete head-to-head in the championships, rising through quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals based on winning a best of three runs. Collectively, riders will gain points based on their performance at each Snow League event, with points aggregated to decide an overall male and female world champion at the close of the series.\n\nThe Snow League clearly aims to capitalize on a void in the market, with a number of events -- such as Dew Tour and Burton's U.S. Open -- being minimized or axed outright in recent years. While there are still plenty of snowboarding and freeskiing competitions scattered across the calendar, these are one-off events, existing in singularity.\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding lacks what Foster calls a \"legit tour, like the World Surf League.\" The Snow League won't just give athletes an arena to compete in and money to bring out the best of the best, but also give fans a continuous narrative and circuit to follow, akin to popular models like the World Surf League, Formula 1 auto racing, and the IFSC World Cup for competitive rock climbing.\n\nIronically, White's announcement came just days after the X Games announced a new venture of its own. The long-running extreme sports competition -- which prominently features snowboarding -- is shifting from a series of one-off events to a year-round, team-based league, dubbed \"the X Games League.\" Unlike the solo, head-to-head nature of The Snow League, the X Games League will include both winter and summer editions, and teams will be co-ed and multi-disciplinary, with male and female snowboarders and skiers competing on the same team. \"We've used Formula One as a model for this new X Games League,\" said executive chairman Jeff Moorad.\n\nWhile at first glance the two may seem set in opposition, Foster doesn't feel the X Games League and Snow League target the same mark. Compared to the team-based, multidisciplinary X-Games League, \"The Snow League is a more traditional, individual contest, which is more core to action sports,\" he said. \"I don't think it'll compete with the X Games League.\"\n\nFoster hopes the Snow League could also benefit up-and-coming riders, many of whom struggle to earn enough from the sport to cover their costs. In a viral Instagram video posted earlier this year, Olympic freestyle skier Nick Goepper broke down his prize winnings throughout the World Cup season. Goepper said he earned $7,000 overall after placing inside the top-five in four different rounds. \"If I placed the same in these sports, I would have earned $1.9 million in tennis, $4.2 million in golf, $70,000 in surfing, $67,000 in bowling, and $235,000 in darts,\" Goepper said in the video.\n\nHow athletes juggle The Snow League with the World Cup and other competitions is yet to be seen. The 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina will run February 6-22, just before the Snow League's debut event.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see if any riders don't do The Snow League to focus fully on the Olympics,\" Foster said. \"But I think the prize money purse will make it a priority for most people.\"", "source": {"uri": "outsideonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Outside Online"},

Atesmen said he first began discussing the league concept with White last year.\n\n\"[White] really wants to leave the sport in a better place than it was when he was competing,\" Atesmen said. \"And he was very open to making sure that we approached the league in a way that was sustainable. That was a bit unique, because all the previous competitions weren't standalone businesses, for the most part, but they were marketing extensions for Burton, for Mountain Dew, for ESPN.\"\n\n\"Shaun has been great at synthesizing his vision with the business or the unit economics of it all to make sure we're putting something together that has legs and, most importantly, will be around in five years,\" Atesmen added.\n\nThe Snow League has been capitalized with a $4.5M seed round led by Will Ventures, which had previously backed The Skills. Will Ventures cofounder and managing partner Isaiah Kacyvenski explained that White's involvement will be critical to elevating and sustaining the snowsports league.\n\n\"Starting a league carries a lot of risk,\" said Kacyvenski. \"One of those blueprints we look for is having a name like Shaun, who is very involved in every single aspect of the business. Having that kind of Michael Jordan of the sport really helps derisk things in a lot of ways when you think about distribution, sponsorship dollars and the attraction of athletes and talent across the board.\"\n\nWill Ventures was joined in the funding round by Ares, Bolt and Ryan Ventures, and individuals including Andreessen Horowitz partner Jeff Jordan and former NFL star Larry Fitzgerald.\n\nWhite, who also has an equity stake in the league, first co-invested alongside Blitzer last year in acquiring Oregon-based youth action sports camp operator We Are Camp. White credited Miles Nathan, who leads White's family office, with playing a key role in sourcing investors.\n\nAtesmen said the league is working with Range Media Partners on commercial sales. Both Atesmen and White noted that they're carefully positioning The Snow League to attract larger, blue-chip sponsors.\n\n\"We're trying to create something that's a little more elevated,\" said White. \"It's even why we called it The Snow League. It's not anything to do with 'extreme.' It sounds like something that's already been around for years.\"\n\nBroadcast negotiations remain ongoing, though Atesmen said the league plans to have multiple broadcasters with distribution across both linear and streaming platforms. The Snow League is also pursuing international broadcast deals.\n\nAtesmen wouldn't comment on the league's revenue projections but expects individual tour stops can be breakeven \"very quickly,\" with the overall operation able to reach profitability within three or four years. That timeline is largely built on controlled spending, though long-term goals are ambitious, with plans to expand beyond halfpipe competition -- the debut season will feature freeskiing at one event -- and to eventually grow to some 10 to 15 events per season.\n\nWhite and Atesmen spoke to SBJ prior to last week's news that the X Games now plans to expand into a team-format league property, with at least four teams owned by outside investors. The X Games was majority acquired by Jeff Moorad and Jahm Najafi's MSP Sports Capital in 2022, with a division of ESPN retaining a minority stake in the business.\n\nWhite admitted that launching The Snow League has led to thoughts about coming out of retirement, but he said he's ultimately more focused on building a legacy that stretches beyond his personal trips to the top of the podium.\n\n\"Being able to be maybe the sport's champion or the riders' champion at this point, rather than my own champion, has been pretty rewarding,\" White said.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbusinessjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "sportsbusinessjournal.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_smith@sportsbusinessjournal.com", "name": "Chris Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain Dew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winter sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jordan_(venture_capitalist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Jordan (venture capitalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Fitzgerald", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Fitzgerald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andreessen Horowitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extreme sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Silverado_250", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Silverado 250"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Moorad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Moorad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeskiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freeskiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-pipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Half-pipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/-/media/Images/Daily/2024/06/17/SOCIAL/Snow-League-copy.ashx", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658185", "eventUri": "eng-9658185", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

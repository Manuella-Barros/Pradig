But critics say he has disappointed.\n\nUnder his watch unemployment has reached an almost record high, pushing the ANC towards its worst election result ever.\n\nThe party's latest tilt towards the centre, with a coalition supported by centre-right and right-wing groups, might further hamper his popularity, particularly among ANC ranks.\n\nThe broad-church party is a progressive outfit of the

malcontent among cadres and observers believe some ANC lawmakers might vote against him on Friday, under cover of the secret ballot.\n\nstr-dc-ub/dc/rlp\n\nMore from this section\n\nAvenu Insights &

(Per-Anders Pettersson/Getty Images)\n\nThe ANC said on Thursday it had made a \"breakthrough\" in its efforts to create a government of national unity (GNU) and its negotiators were \"working against time\" to conclude a framework agreement ahead of Friday's first sitting of the National Assembly.\n\nThe party has held talks with all but two of 17 political parties who have representation in parliament and has managed to secure broad support for the GNU from the \"majority\" of them, who are likely to vote for its presidential candidate, Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nThe Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has already indicated its support for the unity government being put together by the ANC, along with the Patriotic Alliance (PA), with the Democratic Alliance (DA) also endorsing cooperation with the governing party.\n\nThe ANC's national executive committee met in Cape Town on Thursday evening to hear report backs from its negotiating team, headed by secretary general Fikile Mbalula, on progress made over the past week.\n\nMbalula told a media briefing at the conclusion of the meeting that the ANC had achieved a \"breakthrough\" in its talks with most of the parties, but declined to provide any further information about the agreement.\n\nHe said the detail was still being concluded ahead of parliament's sitting on Friday, but would be made public once it had been signed by all of the parties involved.\n\nThese did not include uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party or the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which the ANC had met but with which it had been unable to conclude any kind of agreement.\n\n\"We have accepted that and we move on,\" Mbalula said, adding that he was confident that the other parties would vote with the ANC in the first National Assembly session.\n\n\"We hope that we will work with many of them in the election of the president and the speaker,\" he said.\n\nOther parties that had supported the GNU included the United Democratic Movement, the Freedom Front Plus and the National Freedom Party (NFP), while Rise Mzansi and the Cape Coloured Congress had expressed concerns over how it would work.\n\nMbalula said the ANC had approached the parties with \"decency\" and \"maturely\" and with \"no arrogance\" in an attempt to find common ground with them.\n\n\"The ANC is humbled by the fact that the spirit of engagement with all of South Africa's political parties have been characterised by the common commitment to put the interests of the people first and to ensure that our country comes together to address the common challenges it faces,\" he said.\n\n\"We have ourselves moved forward and invited everyone to participate. Beyond that, we need to engage in a national dialogue. The ANC is trying to pause and reflect on this moment. This political reflection will continue.\"\n\nMbalula said the majority of the parties had focused on the principles -- including constitutionality and commitment to the rule of law -- rather than approaching the negotiations in a \"transactional manner\".\n\n\"We defined the concept and at the same time everybody embraced the concept,\" he said.\n\n\"That to us represents a major breakthrough.\"\n\nMbalula said the work \"doesn't stop tomorrow\" because \"these are uncharted waters\" in which the ANC now had to work with other parties in a \"framework of cooperation\" for the first time.\n\nThe ANC would also lead a government of provincial unity in Gauteng, where it would receive the backing of the same coalition partners.\n\nIt is set to break its coalition in the province's municipalities with the EFF -- Ekurhuleni finance MMC Nkululkeo Dunga was the first to go on Wednesday night -- as part of the Gauteng agreement with its new partners.\n\nIn KwaZulu-Natal the ANC has agreed to join the government being led by the IFP, which also involved the NFP and the DA.\n\nEarlier in the day, NFP president Ivan Barnes confirmed that the party's single provincial MP, Mbali Shinga, would vote for IFP KwaZulu-Natal provincial chairperson Thami Ntuli as premier.\n\nThis is despite an attempt by Jacob Zuma to convince Barnes to work with the MK party on Wednesday -- and an earlier rejection of Ntuli as premier candidate by the NFP over existing local government tensions with the IFP.\n\nThe decision gives the IFP-led coalition 41 of 80 votes in the provincial legislature, a slim majority over the MK party (37) and the EFF (two), but enough to form a government of provincial unity.\n\nIn a separate media briefing on Thursday evening, EFF leader Julius Malema said he had made clear during talks with Ramaphosa that his party would not participate in a government of national unity that included the DA, accusing it of promoting \"white supremacy\".",

"body": "CAPE TOWN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) looks forward to the establishment of a government of national unity, said the party's Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula on Thursday.\n\nMbalula made the remarks on the eve of the first sitting of the National Assembly, lower house of parliament, on Friday to elect the South African president for the next five years.\n\n\"The ANC looks forward to the commencement of the seventh democratic parliament and the establishment of the government of national unity,\" Mbalula told a press briefing after a meeting of the ANC's National Executive Committee on Wednesday evening in Cape Town, the legislative capital of South Africa.\n\nMbalula said his party's negotiation team has over the past week held multiple engagements and discussions with political parties which will receive seats in the parliament, including the main opposition party Democratic Alliance, the Inkatha Freedom Party and several other small groups.\n\n\"We have reached a breakthrough on the common agreement that we need to work together, whether others call this government of national unity or they call it any other thing for that matter,\" he noted. \"But we have agreed with these political parties that we need to gravitate to the center.\"\n\nThe ANC secretary-general also stressed that his party is \"not going to retreat on the concept of the government of national unity, because we believe that the government of national unity, to us, represents the outcome of the elections.\"\n\n\"We did not get outright majority,\" Mbalula said. \"We are in no position to govern this country alone.\"\n\n\"The ANC is humbled by the fact that the spirit of the engagement with all South Africa's political parties has been characterized by the common commitment to put the interests of the people first, and to ensure that our country comes together to address the common challenges it faces,\" he added.\n\nIn the general elections held on May 29, the ANC secured 159 out of the 400 seats in the National Assembly, for the first time falling below the 50 percent needed to maintain its 30-year-old unchallenged majority in the lower house of parliament. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

No further details can be provided about the ongoing discussions -- including meetings Ramaphosa is having with other party leaders -- that are expected to continue late into the night, he said.\n\nThe ANC has been forced to seek an alliance with rivals after losing its parliamentary majority last month for the first time since 1994, securing only 40.2% of the vote. It's been wooing opposition parties as lawmakers prepare to meet on Friday to elect the president, as well as the speaker and deputy speaker of parliament.\n\n\"We have met with all 17 parties\" in parliament, Mbalula told reporters in Cape Town. \"We hope to work with most of them in the election of the president and the speaker.\"\n\nThe rand pared a decline of as much as 0.8% to trade 0.4% weaker at 18.4480 per dollar as of 9:40 p.m. in Johannesburg.\n\nRamaphosa on Thursday held talks with opposition officials including DA leader John Steenhuisen and may meet again with Julius Malema, the head of the leftist Economic Freedom Fighters, Mbalula said. Exploratory talks have been held with the uMkhonto weSizwe Party led by former President Jacob Zuma, and those talks will continue, he said.\n\nAmong sticking points in discussions about forming the next government is over who gets the position of speaker of parliament, according to people familiar with the matter. Both the DA and the EFF are angling for the powerful position as head of the assembly and have asked Ramaphosa to consider their members as candidates, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private.\n\nIn return for the appointment of its candidate as speaker, the EFF offered to support Ramaphosa's candidacy as president. The party reiterated its refusal to join a government that includes the DA.\n\nFor its part, the DA wants positions in cabinet and in the legislature proportional to its performance in the election, in which it garnered 21.8% of the vote. The DA's federal executive is meeting on Thursday night and is unlikely to sign off on any agreement on a new government that's not in writing and which includes the EFF.\n\nSome of the demands being made by the DA are out reach, Mbalula said, without providing details.\n\n\"If the DA gets some of these things that they want, then we as the ANC will be dead,\" he said.\n\nStill, the ANC remains committed to reaching an agreement on a broad alliance and there's an acceptance among parties involved in the discussions that they \"have to gravitate toward the center,\" Mbalula said.\n\nSign up here for the twice-weekly Next Africa newsletter\n\n--With assistance from Ntando Thukwana, Robert Brand and Arijit Ghosh.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Matzah, haroset and bitter herbs were arrayed on a seder plate used by students sharing the holiday meal together.\n\nBut in other ways, the seder lived up to the century-old university's longtime reputation as a hotbed of radical politics. The seder plate included both olives and strawberries for Palestinian rights. At the end of the meal, attendees adapted the traditional concluding words to say, \"Next year in free Jerusalem\" -- a reference to the oppression that its participants say Palestinians face from Israel.\n\nThe seder was one of dozens organized by anti-Zionist Jewish students on college campuses this Passover, as part of a sweeping pro-Palestinian protest movement that has spiraled out from Columbia University, about seven miles north of The New School in Manhattan. As at Columbia, police broke up The New School's encampment, arresting 43 people last week.\n\nNow, faculty members have created an encampment of their own, marking a first in the movement and vowing not to turn in grades until the students' demands for divestment from Israel are met.\n\nWhat distinguishes the New School seder -- and its faculty encampment -- is that both have the support of the school's Jewish religious leader, who identifies as an anti-Zionist.\n\n\"I am deeply moved that so many [New School] students have joined the Gaza solidarity encampment,\" Louisa Solomon, an alumna with decades of anti-Zionist activism under her belt, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \"We are witnessing a multiracial, multifaith global movement for liberation and our students at TNS represent a vibrant piece of it, demanding their tuition dollars stop supporting genocide.\"\n\nSolomon, a student at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Seminary, became The New School's on-campus rabbi last fall -- the first in the school's history. Solomon arrived on campus just before the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that launched the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and spurred anti-Israel protests worldwide, including at colleges and universities.\n\n\"It often feels to me like what happened after Oct. 7 is that the center fell out,\" Solomon told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \"Cracks and divides in the Jewish community are longstanding. But the inflammation and passion and pain around them is more pronounced after Oct. 7. And that's true at The New School, I think, as it is elsewhere.\"\n\nSolomon stands out because most campus rabbis are affiliated with either Hillel International or the Chabad Hasidic movement, both of which support Israel. Many at schools with encampments have focused on supporting and advocating for Jewish undergraduates who have been disquieted, and at times targeted and harassed, by the protests. Like most rabbis, they reject the notion that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nSolomon, by contrast, was one of about 300 people arrested at the anti-Zionist Jewish Voice for Peace's \"emergency seder in the streets\" to protest U.S. support for the Israeli military on the second night of Passover. It was not her first time facing arrest for pro-Palestinian activism since Oct. 7. She is a member of the group Rabbis for Ceasefire.\n\nHer work on campus, where she was hired part-time primarily to serve the non-Zionist Jewish Culture Club, has centered on supporting students who are participating in the protests.\n\n\"As I met with Jewish students at the TNS Gaza solidarity encampment preparing for Shabbat services to be held there, I was struck by how much of their pain and fear comes not from the sources mainstream media suggests, but from Jewish communities,\" she told JTA. \"Jewish parents, camps and synagogues are in many cases condemning these courageous students, questioning their Judaism, kicking them out.\"\n\nSolomon was hired on a part-time basis, primarily to provide support to the school's Jewish Culture Club. The club was created as an alternative to Hillel, which has a small presence and no dedicated staff on campus. (The seven-college Hillel consortium serving the school also does not employ a rabbi.)\n\nSolomon's support for the club has benefited students who are involved, they told JTA.\n\n\"As a Jewish student, the Jewish Culture Club has been a very safe space for me, especially meeting with Louisa and meeting with other students at these events,\" said Stella, who has been active in the New School's encampment. (She asked to be identified by a nickname and that her last name not be used because the administration had threatened to suspend students involved in the protest.)\n\nAlthough not explicitly anti-Zionist at its inception, since Oct. 7 the Jewish Culture Club has trended that way. It condemned a Hillel trip to Israel that students at other city colleges took last fall. And it joined Students for Justice in Palestine in protesting when Hillel (which had just absorbed a pro-Israel advocacy group) invited an Israel Defense Forces soldier to speak about his Oct. 7 experience. It also held a Shabbat service in the encampment.\n\nThe divide between Hillel and the Jewish Culture Club has been deepening, according to a recent report in The New School's student newspaper. The paper reported that the pro-Israel advocacy group had messaged the Jewish Culture Club to collaborate on an event but had not gotten a response. Solomon, meanwhile, said she has tried to set up a meeting with the Hillel president but did not hear back.\n\nJTA was unable to reach Hillel's student president at The New School, and the director of the CUNY/Baruch Hillel consortium did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut some Hillel-affiliated students have taken notice of Solomon's presence. Henry Shane, a Jewish junior who is on the Hillel student board, told JTA last month that he was avoiding campus entirely because of the encampment. Occasionally, Shane attends New York University's Conservative minyan, which is run through that school's own Hillel. He still keeps in touch with his hometown rabbi in California, too. But he said he doesn't feel like he has pastoral support from his own university.\n\n\"It's really unfortunate that The New School has a rabbinic intern who has made clear on her social media platform where she stands,\" Shane told JTA. \"She does attend many of these demonstrations at The New School and I think that has also really defined who she is for many students.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at Columbia, Jewish student pro-Palestinian protesters said they craved the kind of rabbinic support Solomon offers. Shay Lev, a sophomore active in Jewish Voice for Peace and that school's encampment, said it was \"so cool\" to hear about a rabbi who was supporting anti-Zionist Jewish students. (Like Stella, Shay Lev -- the student's first and middle names -- declined to be identified by their full name because of fear of retribution.)\n\n\"I've had so many people come to me being, like, 'I haven't gone to a seder, I didn't come to a Shabbat dinner for years, because I haven't felt welcome in Jewish spaces.' And then they come to JVP services, and they pray for the first time in years,\" Shay Lev said. \"And yeah, I would really appreciate an actual qualified rabbi doing it, so I don't have to, because you know, I'm a 20-year-old without any rabbinical training.\"\n\nFounded in 1919, The New School, which enrolls approximately 7,200 undergraduates and is located in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, has a long history of radical activism. \"Dissenting opinions, radical ideas, and progressive solutions have always had a home at The New School,\" the school's website boasts.\n\nIt also notes a handful of past students who were drawn to the school's mission, including former Israeli President Shimon Peres while he worked for Israel's Defense Ministry in the 1950s. Political theorist and Jewish refugee Hannah Arendt, who was critical of Zionism but not opposed to it, was a professor of social research there in the 1960s and '70s.\n\nSolomon graduated in 2005, having majored in cultural studies with a concentration in race, ethnicity and postcolonial studies. As a student, she was also an activist involved in Jews for Racial and Economic Justice and a predecessor to Jewish Voice for Peace, called Jews Against the Occupation.\n\nIn 2002, Solomon was one of four Jewish activists ejected after interrupting a talk by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan to protest Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. \"Fortunately, we weren't arrested in the end, and I think we got our point across,\" she said on the progressive radio show \"Democracy Now\" at the time.\n\nSolomon grew up in a home with parents who were political activists in the 1960s and 1970s -- she recalls a shelf in her home full of books by Black Panthers and a now-out-of-print anthology of Palestinian poetry. Although she says she always felt religious, she didn't have much of a formal religious education. She did not apply to rabbinical school until she was pregnant with her second child, now 4.\n\nIn her current role, she has protested Israel since the earliest days of the war. On Oct. 8, she posted a photo of herself with her child in a sukkah, celebrating the holiday that was ending as news of the Hamas attack and its steep toll was still emerging.\n\n\"Judaism can be liberatory and Judaism can be an instrument of oppression,\" she posted on Instagram. \"Judaism is not Zionism and my kids will not be taught that their Jewishness requires loyalty to Israel, insularity, or valuing Jewish life more than non-Jewish life.\"\n\nShe credits her time at The New School with awakening her as a Jewish activist.\n\n\"Jewishness for me was very connected to social justice activism as a young person,\" she said. \"I made Jewish friends at The New School and found that many of us were queer, many of us were far to the left of the established Jewish communities we'd had access to before. And we got connected to Jewish activism.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Solomon's activism receded somewhat as she embarked on both a professional and musical career. She worked first at UJA-Federation of New York, which has a long history of supporting Israel, and then at the publishing house Simon and Schuster for many years while also touring with her band The Shondes, whose Yiddish name means \"shame.\"\n\nBut she was never shy about her opposition to Israel, and in 2014, the Washington, D.C., Jewish federation canceled The Shondes' headlining role at a music festival over Solomon's support for the movement to boycott Israel.\n\nSolomon said at the time that she and her bandmates had engaged in activism together as New School students and that she felt they were making an impact on Jewish fans who supported Israel.\n\n\"Since the band formed in 2006, we haven't had as much time for that kind of activism,\" she told Tablet. \"A lot of it has happened through the band's shows, and trying to do events with Hillels has brought forth opportunities to talk about the issue with Zionists.\"\n\nJonathan Sarna, a prominent Jewish historian and professor at Brandeis University, said Solomon's appointment reflects two trends: a growing shortage of non-Orthodox rabbis to fill open positions, and rising anti-Israel sentiment among younger Jews.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, there was a rabbinical student declaration [about Israel] that really angered many, many leaders of the Jewish community because of the virulent-seeming one-sidedness, as they saw it, of the documents,\" he said, referring to a 2021 petition by dozens of rabbinical students accusing Israel of apartheid. \"There was this question, 'Will young rabbis be able to lead the community?' Now we are seeing that that is coming forward.\"\n\nSarna, who disparaged Jewish participation in the encampments, lamented the idea of a campus rabbi who ideologically overlaps with only some Jewish students on campus. \"Part of your obligation is to say 'I'm available to the whole spectrum of Jews,' just like in a family,\" he said.\n\nSolomon said that she does aim to serve \"any and all students,\" including non-Jewish students, who seek her guidance. She says she would be happy to meet with Hillel's leaders or anyone else, no matter their beliefs about Israel.\n\n\"It's definitely a source of great sadness to me if anyone feels unable to approach me in a rabbinic capacity because of disagreements they have with my political views,\" she said. \"I know what that feels like, to be a person who can't seek out support from a rabbi, because that rabbi has alienated me -- certainly an experience many of us have had.\"\n\nCritics and allies of Solomon agree on at least one thing: In light of the seismic shifts transforming the American Jewish world since Oct. 7, the idea of an anti-Zionist campus rabbi is no longer as surprising as it once was.\n\n\"There's that old saying that Jews have a difficult time agreeing on things,\" Stella said. \"There's so much diversity in Jewish culture, so I don't think the idea of an anti-Zionist rabbi is so radical.\"", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"},

Solomon arrived on campus just before the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that launched the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and spurred anti-Israel protests worldwide, including at colleges and universities.\n\n\"It often feels to me like what happened after Oct. 7 is that the center fell out,\" Solomon told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \"Cracks and divides in the Jewish community are longstanding. But the inflammation and passion and pain around them is more pronounced after Oct. 7. And that's true at The New School, I think, as it is elsewhere.\"\n\nSolomon stands out because most campus rabbis are affiliated with either Hillel International or the Chabad Hasidic movement, both of which support Israel. Many at schools with encampments have focused on supporting and advocating for Jewish undergraduates who have been disquieted, and at times targeted and harassed, by the protests. Like most rabbis, they reject the notion that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nSolomon, by contrast, was one of about 300 people arrested at the anti-Zionist Jewish Voice for Peace's \"emergency seder in the streets\" to protest U.S. support for the Israeli military on the second night of Passover. It was not her first time facing arrest for pro-Palestinian activism since Oct. 7. She is a member of the group Rabbis for Ceasefire.\n\nHer work on campus, where she was hired part-time primarily to serve the non-Zionist Jewish Culture Club, has centered on supporting students who are participating in the protests.\n\n\"As I met with Jewish students at the TNS Gaza solidarity encampment preparing for Shabbat services to be held there, I was struck by how much of their pain and fear comes not from the sources mainstream media suggests, but from Jewish communities,\" she told JTA. \"Jewish parents, camps and synagogues are in many cases condemning these courageous students, questioning their Judaism, kicking them out.\"\n\nSolomon was hired on a part-time basis, primarily to provide support to the school's Jewish Culture Club. The club was created as an alternative to Hillel, which has a small presence and no dedicated staff on campus. (The seven-college Hillel consortium serving the school also does not employ a rabbi.)\n\nSolomon's support for the club has benefited students who are involved, they told JTA.\n\n\"As a Jewish student, the Jewish Culture Club has been a very safe space for me, especially meeting with Louisa and meeting with other students at these events,\" said Stella, who has been active in the New School's encampment. (She asked to be identified by a nickname and that her last name not be used because the administration had threatened to suspend students involved in the protest.)\n\nAlthough not explicitly anti-Zionist at its inception, since Oct. 7 the Jewish Culture Club has trended that way. It condemned a Hillel trip to Israel that students at other city colleges took last fall. And it joined Students for Justice in Palestine in protesting when Hillel (which had just absorbed a pro-Israel advocacy group) invited an Israel Defense Forces soldier to speak about his Oct. 7 experience. It also held a Shabbat service in the encampment.\n\nThe divide between Hillel and the Jewish Culture Club has been deepening, according to a recent report in The New School's student newspaper. The paper reported that the pro-Israel advocacy group had messaged the Jewish Culture Club to collaborate on an event but had not gotten a response. Solomon, meanwhile, said she has tried to set up a meeting with the Hillel president but did not hear back.\n\nJTA was unable to reach Hillel's student president at The New School, and the director of the CUNY/Baruch Hillel consortium did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut some Hillel-affiliated students have taken notice of Solomon's presence. Henry Shane, a Jewish junior who is on the Hillel student board, told JTA last month that he was avoiding campus entirely because of the encampment. Occasionally, Shane attends New York University's Conservative minyan, which is run through that school's own Hillel. He still keeps in touch with his hometown rabbi in California, too. But he said he doesn't feel like he has pastoral support from his own university.\n\n\"It's really unfortunate that The New School has a rabbinic intern who has made clear on her social media platform where she stands,\" Shane told JTA. \"She does attend many of these demonstrations at The New School and I think that has also really defined who she is for many students.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at Columbia, Jewish student pro-Palestinian protesters said they craved the kind of rabbinic support Solomon offers. Shay Lev, a sophomore active in Jewish Voice for Peace and that school's encampment, said it was \"so cool\" to hear about a rabbi who was supporting anti-Zionist Jewish students. (Like Stella, Shay Lev -- the student's first and middle names -- declined to be identified by their full name because of fear of retribution.)\n\n\"I've had so many people come to me being, like, 'I haven't gone to a seder, I didn't come to a Shabbat dinner for years, because I haven't felt welcome in Jewish spaces.' And then they come to JVP services, and they pray for the first time in years,\" Shay Lev said. \"And yeah, I would really appreciate an actual qualified rabbi doing it, so I don't have to, because you know, I'm a 20-year-old without any rabbinical training.\"\n\nFounded in 1919, The New School, which enrolls approximately 7,200 undergraduates and is located in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, has a long history of radical activism. \"Dissenting opinions, radical ideas, and progressive solutions have always had a home at The New School,\" the school's website boasts.\n\nIt also notes a handful of past students who were drawn to the school's mission, including former Israeli President Shimon Peres while he worked for Israel's Defense Ministry in the 1950s. Political theorist and Jewish refugee Hannah Arendt, who was critical of Zionism but not opposed to it, was a professor of social research there in the 1960s and '70s.\n\nSolomon graduated in 2005, having majored in cultural studies with a concentration in race, ethnicity and postcolonial studies. As a student, she was also an activist involved in Jews for Racial and Economic Justice and a predecessor to Jewish Voice for Peace, called Jews Against the Occupation.\n\nIn 2002, Solomon was one of four Jewish activists ejected after interrupting a talk by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan to protest Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. \"Fortunately, we weren't arrested in the end, and I think we got our point across,\" she said on the progressive radio show \"Democracy Now\" at the time.\n\nSolomon grew up in a home with parents who were political activists in the 1960s and 1970s -- she recalls a shelf in her home full of books by Black Panthers and a now-out-of-print anthology of Palestinian poetry. Although she says she always felt religious, she didn't have much of a formal religious education. She did not apply to rabbinical school until she was pregnant with her second child, now 4.\n\nIn her current role, she has protested Israel since the earliest days of the war. On Oct. 8, she posted a photo of herself with her child in a sukkah, celebrating the holiday that was ending as news of the Hamas attack and its steep toll was still emerging.\n\n\"Judaism can be liberatory and Judaism can be an instrument of oppression,\" she posted on Instagram. \"Judaism is not Zionism and my kids will not be taught that their Jewishness requires loyalty to Israel, insularity, or valuing Jewish life more than non-Jewish life.\"\n\nShe credits her time at The New School with awakening her as a Jewish activist.\n\n\"Jewishness for me was very connected to social justice activism as a young person,\" she said. \"I made Jewish friends at The New School and found that many of us were queer, many of us were far to the left of the established Jewish communities we'd had access to before. And we got connected to Jewish activism.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Solomon's activism receded somewhat as she embarked on both a professional and musical career. She worked first at UJA-Federation of New York, which has a long history of supporting Israel, and then at the publishing house Simon and Schuster for many years while also touring with her band The Shondes, whose Yiddish name means \"shame.\"\n\nBut she was never shy about her opposition to Israel, and in 2014, the Washington, D.C., Jewish federation canceled The Shondes' headlining role at a music festival over Solomon's support for the movement to boycott Israel.\n\nSolomon said at the time that she and her bandmates had engaged in activism together as New School students and that she felt they were making an impact on Jewish fans who supported Israel.\n\n\"Since the band formed in 2006, we haven't had as much time for that kind of activism,\" she told Tablet. \"A lot of it has happened through the band's shows, and trying to do events with Hillels has brought forth opportunities to talk about the issue with Zionists.\"\n\nJonathan Sarna, a prominent Jewish historian and professor at Brandeis University, said Solomon's appointment reflects two trends: a growing shortage of non-Orthodox rabbis to fill open positions, and rising anti-Israel sentiment among younger Jews.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, there was a rabbinical student declaration [about Israel] that really angered many, many leaders of the Jewish community because of the virulent-seeming one-sidedness, as they saw it, of the documents,\" he said, referring to a 2021 petition by dozens of rabbinical students accusing Israel of apartheid. \"There was this question, 'Will young rabbis be able to lead the community?' Now we are seeing that that is coming forward.\"\n\nSarna, who disparaged Jewish participation in the encampments, lamented the idea of a campus rabbi who ideologically overlaps with only some Jewish students on campus. \"Part of your obligation is to say 'I'm available to the whole spectrum of Jews,' just like in a family,\" he said.\n\nSolomon said that she does aim to serve \"any and all students,\" including non-Jewish students, who seek her guidance. She says she would be happy to meet with Hillel's leaders or anyone else, no matter their beliefs about Israel.\n\n\"It's definitely a source of great sadness to me if anyone feels unable to approach me in a rabbinic capacity because of disagreements they have with my political views,\" she said. \"I know what that feels like, to be a person who can't seek out support from a rabbi, because that rabbi has alienated me -- certainly an experience many of us have had.\"\n\nCritics and allies of Solomon agree on at least one thing: In light of the seismic shifts transforming the American Jewish world since Oct. 7, the idea of an anti-Zionist campus rabbi is no longer as surprising as it once was.\n\n\"There's that old saying that Jews have a difficult time agreeing on things,\" Stella said. \"There's so much diversity in Jewish culture, so I don't think the idea of an anti-Zionist rabbi is so radical.\"", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic

Waldman, who was born in Tripoli and whose family had lived in Libya for centuries, was persecuted, nearly killed and ultimately forced out of her homeland as a result of horrific pogroms against Jews during the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nWaldman was the first Libyan Jew I had ever met. I will never forget her survivor's account of almost being burned alive when she was 19 years old. Waldman and her family were riding a bus to escape Libya when the bus driver stopped in the middle of the desert and poured gasoline on the vehicle, hoping to set it on fire and murder Jews inside.\n\nWaldman left a deep impression on me and for the first time, I contemplated whether anyone would want to hear my own story, and whether I had anything to contribute in the realms of Jewish advocacy and activism. And as an Iranian, I was incredulous to learn that an educational advocacy organization like JIMENA existed for Jews like me.\n\nThat critical event with Waldman was hosted by UC San Diego Hillel.\n\nI have a special place in my heart for Hillel, formally known as Hillel International, which celebrated its 100th birthday several weeks ago. In honor of this milestone birthday, I want to share with readers for the first time some of my most memorable Hillel experiences, and shed light on the previously-unimaginable challenges that Hillel is now facing as a result of antisemitic students on campus.\n\nI entered college two weeks after 9/11, beginning my freshman year at UC Davis (Go, Aggies!).\n\nFor the first two weeks on campus, I felt viscerally lost and out of place, and I realized it was because I had not met or spoken to another Jew since I had arrived. This sense of loneliness had nothing to do with being religiously observant; it derived from a deep-rooted desire to find my own people, my own kind, while still forming meaningful friendships with many non-Jewish peers.\n\nAfter two weeks of feeling wholly out of place, I finally saw a flier taped to a wall at Olson Hall promoting an AEPi event being held at the Hillel House. I wasn't exactly a candidate for a Jewish fraternity, but I pounced on that flier because I finally realized that UC Davis had a Hillel, and an address to boot.\n\nThe Hillel House at Davis became my home away from home, and I learned much from its patient director, Hillel Damron, a film director and novelist whose parents had survived the Holocaust. I loved that Hillel ran Hillel. Every Friday night, I could be found there for Shabbat dinner, especially because for Persian Jews, Shabbat dinners are sacrosanct. The fellow students felt like family and the food was kosher. In fact, I tasted matzo ball soup for the first time at a Hillel Shabbat dinner. I still missed my mother's Persian Gondi meatballs, but there was something wonderful about those fluffy matzo balls.\n\nIt was at UCD Hillel where I first attended lectures by Middle East experts, including the incomparable Dr. Mitchell Bard. When Bard discussed his vital book, \"Myths and Facts: A Guide to the Arab-Israeli Conflict,\" I realized that in order to honor myself and my identity, I had to learn much more about the modern Middle East.\n\nI spent two years at Davis, during the Second Intifada and the impassioned protests of the early George W. Bush years. At times when I felt the most unsafe during massive anti-Israel campus rallies, I walked quickly to that Hillel house on A Street and spent a few hours socializing and, of course, eating.\n\nAs a junior, I transferred to UC San Diego, where, during my campus tour, I met a young Hillel program director named Keri Copans (n\u00e9e Savage). This time, I didn't even have to wait two long weeks to find my home away from home.\n\nI immersed myself fully in UCSD Hillel and its pro-Israel student group, where I met lifelong friends. I even wrote for the Jewish student paper. Every Friday night, I was at the International Center, which Hillel used for Shabbat services and dinner (it recently secured a permanent home). At UCSD Hillel Shabbats, I heard non-Iranian tunes to Jewish prayers for the first time. It was magical.\n\nIt was also at UCSD Hillel where the remarkable Rabbi Lisa Goldstein, then the chapter's executive director, taught this public-school Jew how to read Hebrew, and also broke down the elements of Jewish prayer in the siddur. Her brief words of inspiration each Friday night energized me for the week.\n\nHillel is one of the reasons why, after graduation, I proudly served at the Consulate General of Israel in Los Angeles, co-founded 30 Years After to encourage civic action among a new generation of Iranian American Jews, and why, for half a decade, I have been a weekly columnist for The Jewish Journal.\n\nDuring graduate school at USC (Go, Trojans!), I even briefly worked at Hillel. It was then that I was first exposed to a new low in campus anti-Israel activity: Hateful students were no longer merely boycotting pro-Israel campus groups, they were going directly after Hillel.\n\nBeginning a few years ago, protesters began appearing outside Hillel at UC San Diego, often in response to conflicts between Hamas and Israel, such as those in May 2021. Jewish students who wanted to attend everything from a \"Lunch and Learn\" to a Shabbat dinner were faced with protesters.\n\nIs Hillel an arm of the Israeli government? No. Does it have the right to include Israel as part of its wonderful programming because the Jewish state is an important element in the identity of most American Jews? Of course.\n\nAfter Oct. 7, the targeting of Hillel on campuses nationwide has been particularly unforgivable. Recently, a flier at a local university attacked Hillel by depicting a Hillel logo and fulminating: \"Zionist Alert! Long Beach State University endorsed generations of Zionist bigots. Should LBSU students be taught to be hateful?\" At the bottom of the flier, there was a photo of Jewish students seated at a table, drinking sodas. Oh, the pernicious activities of Hillel students. Also, I don't know whether to laugh or cry at the ominous warning of \"Zionist Alert!\"\n\nThe irony is brutal. Whoever created that flier is a shameless bigot. But \"generations\" of Jews, whether current students or alumni, are \"Zionist bigots.\" That's funny. When I first started attending Hillel Shabbat dinners, I was mostly there for the free matzah ball soup. The Zionist bigot addition was a delightful afterthought.\n\nFor decades, Hillel staff have tried their best to support Jewish students of all religious and political backgrounds, from right-wing to left-wing. Their job is not easy.\n\nThere's another irony: For decades, Hillel staff have tried their best to support Jewish students of all religious and political backgrounds, from right-wing to left-wing. Their job is not easy, especially because, unlike off-campus organizations, Hillel has to be very careful in how it approaches campus administration.\n\nTo Hillel International: I stand unequivocally with you, your resilient students and your devoted staff. One of the most meaningful moments of my career occurred when JIMENA invited me to speak at UC San Diego, alongside Gina Waldman, roughly 10 years after I had graduated. Of course, the event was also organized by UCSD Hillel.\n\nIf Hillel has meant anything to you, please contact the Hillel at your alma mater; offer support and ask how you can help.

It's been an incredible example of how we can all collectively take care of one another, educate one another, and sustain ourselves.\"\n\nStudent protesters are gathered in solidarity with similar encampments around the country and world to highlight the deaths in the Israel-Hamas war, call for the liberation of the Palestinian people and demand that universities stop doing business with Israel or companies that support the war in Gaza.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Israel's retaliatory military operation following the Hamas attack on Israel Oct. 7 has killed more than 34,700 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and driven around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. In the United States, more than 2,100 protesters supporting Palestine have been arrested over the last two weeks on universities across the country.\n\nThe UCSC encampment, which was organized by the local chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, has a list of specific demands that can be found in a link on its social media page. The UCSC protesters stress that the demands must be met before they will disperse.\n\nThe six demands, in short, call for the university to completely divest from weapon-manufacturing companies and to cease research collaborations with weapon manufacturing industries, and that instead UCSC should invest in its students and workers -- and to disclose and provide full transparency of the University of California's assets including investments, donations and grants.\n\nThe demands include an \"end to targeted repression and policing of pro-Palestinian advocacy on campus. Reject the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-semitism which conflates anti-zionism with anti-semitism. Protect free speech and roll back all academic discipline and/or charges against protestors.\"\n\nThe group also demands all police officers be removed from UCSC campus, and that the university sever ties with the Santa Cruz Police Department and remove all mass surveillance technology on campus.\n\nThe group demands \"that UC must acknowledge the ongoing genocide of Palestinians since the inception of the zionist state, and call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and an end to the occupation in Palestine.\"\n\nThe demand that has received the most public scrutiny is one calling for \"a complete academic boycott,\" which includes \"cutting ties UC wide with all zionist institutions -- including study abroad programs, fellowships, seminars, research collaborations and universities. Cut ties with the Helen Diller foundation, Koret foundation, Israel institute, and Hillel International. Comply with BDS (boycott, divestment, sanction), as according to the BDS National Committee, within all University operations. Universities should not be working with universities which are complicit and benefit from genocide.\"\n\nThe local chapter of Hillel International, Santa Cruz Hillel, published a statement about the encampment on its social media pages stating that, \"We respect students' right to protest about causes they care deeply about and know Jewish students on campus have different feelings regarding this protest.\"\n\nThe statement concludes, \"we are deeply concerned that the protesters' demands include a UC-wide boycott of organizations that support Jewish studies, Jewish life, and address campus climate and antisemitism.\"\n\n\"Many people are confusing Hillel International with the individual Hillels,\" said the encampment's media liaison Savvy Lane. \"Hillel International is a major Zionist organization that is pro-student suppression and anti-BDS (boycott, divestment, sanction). As long as we have ties to Hillel International here we cannot have BDS. We are not trying to eliminate safe space for Jewish people. We just think there should be safe spaces for Jewish people that also do not condone genocide.\"\n\nS\u00e1rosi, a third-year UCSC student and who is Jewish, elaborated further about why the protesters are demanding a \"complete academic boycott,\" especially from Hillel International, which states on its website that, \"Israel is at the heart of Hillel's work.\"\n\n\"We are here because we are trying to get the university to divest from complicity in violence against Palestinians and it has very little to do with the Jewish people,\" said S\u00e1rosi. \"The issue we have, especially as a Jewish student here, is that the institutional relationship that UC Santa Cruz has with Hillel, is one of a monopoly over all Jewish cultural life. For example, UCSC consults Hillel regarding anything Jewish, and that's an issue for us because Hillel does not welcome us or represent us.\"", "source": {"uri": "santacruzsentinel.com", "dataType":

Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., who flung a series of questions at Cardona to get him to make clear stances on certain incidents amid the uproar on college campuses due to the Gaza conflict. Before his barrage of questions, Kiley acknowledged a letter written by Cardona which entailed the secretary calling any incidents of violence and intimidation against Jewish students \"abhorrent.\"\n\n\"As the 2023-24 school year comes to a close, I remain incredibly concerned by the reports of antisemitic hate directed at students on some campuses,\" the letter read.\n\nKiley tied the letter to what some would consider antisemitic demands from anti-Israel protesters for colleges to cut ties with Hillel International, which facilitates local Hillel chapters at 850 colleges globally.\n\nPOLICE CLEAR ANTI-ISRAEL ENCAMPMENT AT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, PROTESTS CONTINUE NATIONWIDE\n\nColleges and universities across the U.S. have a local Hillel community that serves as a faith-based Jewish educational resource. These organizations provide a social network and a place to develop leadership and professional skills for Jewish students.\n\n\"How about demands to cut ties with Hillel?\" Kiley asked Cardona. \"Do you condemn those demands to cut ties with Hillel at universities?\"\n\n\"There's guidance there [DOE's website] for universities where a lot of the questions you're asking makes it very clear,\" the secretary responded.\n\n\"Ok, but your letter said that certain things are abhorrent on campus. Would you say that's one of them? Calls for universities to cut ties with Hillel, is that abhorrent, to use your word?\" Kiley pressed.\n\n\"Violence toward students, antisemitism on campus which we've seen-\" Cardona said before being cut-off mid-sentence by Kiley asking, \"Mr. Secretary, you're not willing to condemn calls to cut ties with Hillel? Will you condemn that, yes or no?\"\n\n\"We are responsible for adhering to Title 6 and enforcing it. And your support of our budget would help us get to that level instead of creating division as I said at the beginning of my call...\" Cardona ducked the question again.\n\nKiley's questioning comes as chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) call for universities to end any relationship with Hillel.\n\nThe School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York City SJP demanded their school \"cut ties with Hillel International and any other Zionist Institutions. Hillel at SVA is an explicitly Zionist club that is officially registered with SVA. It's a chapter of the larger Hillel International organization that receives funding from AIPAC, a Zionist lobbyist organization. Hillel has paid for and advertised 'birthright' trips to 'Israel' towards Hillel at SVA and other Hillel chapters while 'Israel' continuously displaces and murders Palestinians.\"\n\nSJP at UC Santa Cruz posted their demands on Instagram last week for their university to \"Cut ties UC wide with all Zionist institutions,\" including Hillel International, as part of a \"complete academic boycott.\"\n\nSanta Cruz Hillel responded to the Instagram post, stating that they are \"deeply concerned that the protesters' demands include a UC wide boycott of organizations that support Jewish studies, Jewish life, and address campus climate and anti-Semitism.\"\n\nANTI-ISRAEL ENCAMPMENTS SHARE COMMON TRAITS WITH MARXIST REVOLUTIONARIES, BLM AND THE KKK\n\n\"We've seen at a number of campuses, such as U.C. San Diego and UCLA, protesters who have blocked, physically, Jewish students from entering spaces on campuses. Do you condemn that behavior?,\" Kiley asked.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Cardona replied.\n\n\"How about these encampments themselves?\" Kiley asked. \"Do you condemn that?\"\n\n\"I condemn behaviors that are unsafe, and I leave it to the university leaders and their board of governors to address how they handle encampments or other issues that are happening on campus,\" Cardona said.\n\n\"Acts of intimidation, violence toward Jewish students, or any student for that matter, are not tolerated. That's not, as the president said, that's not protesting, that's creating harassment on campus,\" he added. \"The university has the responsibility to follow and to uphold their rules on campus.\"\n\nKiley pressed further, \"So can you tell right now, yes or no, do you condemn the encampments on campuses?\"\n\nCardona explained that universities are engaging in dialogue with anti-Israel agitators constructing encampments on campus. Kiley asked Cardona to respond to students who were given orders to leave the encampments. Cardona said that \"if the university directs them to leave, they should leave.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe heated exchange came as anti-Israel demonstrations on college campuses near three weeks of activity. Some universities have requested the assistance of police to deal with the problem, while others have caved in and agreed to certain demands by the protesters.\n\nThe decisions by administrators to either concede some demands of the protesters or allow their activity to continue, stand out amid the chaotic scenes and more than 2,400 arrests on dozens of campuses nationwide since mid-April. Tent encampments and building takeovers have disrupted classes at some schools, including Columbia, USC and UCLA.\n\nThe protesters have mostly demanded that their university cut all ties with Israel, including study abroad programs and links to the Israeli military, now embroiled in the war in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

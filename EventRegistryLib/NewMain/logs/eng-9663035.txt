Man Admits Stalking, Then Stabbing Woman 40 Times in Killing that Raised Fears of Anti-Asian Attacks", "body": "Nicole Acosta is a staff writer on the crime team at PEOPLE. She previously worked at Daily Voice and doNYC and is a Mercy College (now University) graduate.\n\nA New York City man accused of stalking and stabbing a woman 40 times inside her Chinatown apartment in 2022 has pleaded guilty to several charges in connection with the killing, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's office.\n\nOn June 18, Assamad Nash, 27, pleaded guilty in New York State Supreme Court to one count each of second-degree murder and first-degree burglary as a sexually motivated felony, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. said in a press release. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 30 to 30 years to life in state prison.\n\nAccording to court documents cited in the release and as admitted in Nash's guilty plea, the harrowing incident unfolded as Christina Yuna Lee, 35, entered her apartment building near Grand Street and Chrystie Street around 4:20 a.m. on Feb. 13, 2022.\n\nThat early morning, Nash followed Lee into the building and up six flights of stairs to her apartment. There, Nash ran up behind Lee, forced himself into her apartment and attempted to sexually assault her, the release states.\n\nThe New York Post obtained chilling surveillance footage of the incident at the time and described it as showing Nash walk about 6 feet from Lee inside a narrow hallway as she headed to her apartment unit.\n\nAt 4:22 a.m., Lee's neighbors called 911 after hearing sounds of a struggle, including Lee screaming for help, according to the release. A few minutes later, New York police officers arrived at Lee's apartment and heard her screams but were unable to get inside.\n\nMeanwhile, Nash tried to flee the apartment through the fire escape but went back inside after spotting an officer on the roof above him, the release states. By 5:40 a.m. officers broke down the apartment door and found Nash hiding under Lee's bedroom mattress, as well as a bloodied kitchen knife hidden behind the dresser, authorities said.\n\nIn the bathroom, officers found Lee with \"at least 40 stab wounds, including to her head, neck and torso,\" according to the release. Lee was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nNash was initially arraigned in criminal court on a first-degree murder charge and two counts of burglary, PEOPLE previously reported.\n\nLee's slaying happened about a month after Michelle Go, another Asian-American woman, was fatally pushed in front of a subway car, raising fears of attacks against Asian-Americans, according to reporting by New York Times. Around that time, the number of anti-Asian hate crimes documented by the NYPD had doubled from the same period the previous year, the outlet reported.\n\nOn a GoFundMe campaign created in the wake of her death, Lee's loved ones said she was killed in a \"senseless act of violence\" after returning from a night out with friends.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up for PEOPLE's free True Crime newsletter for breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases.\n\n\"Christina was full of life,\" fundraiser organizer Angela Yujin Lee wrote on behalf of the Lee family. \"She radiated positivity, joy, and love. She supported her friends in everything that they did.\"\n\n\"She went above and beyond to make those she loved know she was there for them -- never expecting anything in return,\" the statement continued. \"Her loss is an unfathomable tragedy that her loved ones and her community will struggle with for years to come.\"\n\nIn announcing the guilty plea, District Attorney Bragg thanked police and other investigative teams for their work on the case.\n\n\"Today Assamad Nash was held accountable for senselessly taking Christina Yuna Lee's life after he followed her into her own home,\" he said in the release. \"Ms. Yuna Lee's family and loved ones were deprived of a daughter, sister, and friend.

She worked as a creative producer for an online music platform in New York City.\n\nAuthorities were not able to determine whether her killing was motivated by her ethnicity, but her death sent shock waves through New York's Asian community at a time when many were already fearful after a rise in attacks during the pandemic.\n\nThe killing also alarmed city residents in other neighborhoods, many

Call 911!\" Lee, who worked as a senior creative producer at digital music platform Splice, was heard screaming by neighbors.\n\nBut her desperate cries came too late as Nash had stabbed her at least 40 times, including in the head, neck and torso, and left her body in the bathtub, prosecutors have said.\n\nThe cowardly Nash had infamously tried escaping the apartment through the fire escape but was spooked when he saw a police officer on the roof above him.\n\nHe was eventually found hiding underneath the victim's bed, with the bloodied kitchen knife hidden behind a dresser in the bedroom, cops said.\n\nNash's guilty plea comes near two years after he proclaimed his innocence to The Post, bragging that he didn't think prosecutors had enough evidence to lock him up.\n\n\"They gotta have you on camera killing her. They don't got me on camera killing her.

My thoughts are with her family and our community as they continue healing from this tragedy.\"\n\nNash is expected to be sentenced to 30 years to life in state prison during his sentencing hearing, which is scheduled for July 30, the DA's office said.\n\nCNN has reached out to Nash's attorney for comment.\n\nLast May, Lee's family filed a lawsuit against members of the New York City Police Department and New York City, claiming delays in police assistance and medical care ultimately led to her death.\n\nThe NYPD did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the litigation. New York City's law department previously said it was reviewing the complaint.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in New York County Supreme Court on May 12, states unnamed members of the NYPD \"unlawfully failed to prevent the assault and battery on Ms. Lee or denied and/or delayed providing medical care to Ms. Lee, leading to her pain, suffering and death.\"\n\nThe complaint was filed by Lee's aunt, acting as her estate's administrator, and also named the city as a defendant.\n\nAround 4:21 a.m. on February 13, 2022, Lee was followed by a man who forced entry into her apartment, according to the lawsuit. At least one neighbor called police a few moments later after hearing her screams, the complaint states.\n\nTwo NYPD officers arrived at Lee's apartment door around 4:25 a.m. and heard her yelling for help, according to the complaint. Her screams abruptly stopped, and the officers then spoke with the man through a closed door, the lawsuit says.\n\n\"Despite having reason to believe Ms. Lee's life was in imminent danger, (the two NYPD officers) failed to gain entry to Ms. Lee's apartment or otherwise provide her with any potentially life-saving police or medical assistance at that time,\" the complaint states.\n\nOther NYPD officials did not arrive on scene until about an hour later, despite the police precinct being approximately three blocks away, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"At approximately 5:40 A.M., one hour and twenty minutes after Ms. Lee was first attacked, members of the NYPD Emergency Services Unit forced entry into Ms. Lee's apartment,\" the complaint says.\n\nThe complaint details nine causes of action, including wrongful death, negligence, denial or delay of medical care and violations of the state constitution. The family is seeking a jury trial, punitive damages against the defendants and unspecified compensatory damages.\n\nThe lawsuit also accuses the city of failing to address public safety concerns in a park located across the street from Lee's apartment, citing a separate stabbing death that occurred near the park a few months before Lee's death.\n\nCNN's Nicki Brown contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The family is seeking a jury trial, punitive damages against the defendants and unspecified compensatory damages.\n\nThe lawsuit also accuses the city of failing to address public safety concerns in a park located across the street from Lee's apartment, citing a separate stabbing death that occurred near the park a few months before Lee's death.\n\nCNN's Nicki Brown contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_tucker@cnn.com", "name": "Emma Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "artemis_moshtaghian@cnn.com", "name": "Artemis Moshtaghian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinatown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_death_claim", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful death claim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punitive_damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punitive damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_of_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cause of action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22046650165578.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663035", "eventUri": "eng-9663035", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1152, "textEnd": 1159}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 1693, "textEnd": 1699}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-02-", "textStart": 564, "textEnd": 575, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

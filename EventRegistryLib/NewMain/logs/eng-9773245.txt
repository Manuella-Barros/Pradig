including the boy's welfare, vulnerability and complex needs - should be given a \"heavier consideration\" than public interest factors.\n\nSeeking rehabilitation is the guiding principle of the youth justice system, Ms Brand told the court, adding: \"There is absolutely no evidence that naming actually has a deterrent effect.\"\n\nMr Lewis, representing the boy who has turned 13 since his conviction, urged the court to focus on the facts of Mr Seesahai's killing rather than \"siren calls\" relating to abstract principles from previous cases.\n\n\"How does naming two 12-year-olds better inform public debate?\" Mr Lewis asked. \"It doesn't in our submission.\n\n\"There is no evidence that to name two 12-year-olds would provide any deterrent.\"\n\nThe older defendant - who denied a witness's claims that he inflicted blows with his friend's machete - was \"not regarded as a problem\" at school and had no background of offending or antisocial behaviour, the court was told.\n\nMr Lewis added: \"In the light of that background there is a good prospect, as the authors of the (pre-sentence) report suggest, of rehabilitation in this case.\n\n\"In our submission that's where the interests of justice lie in this case -

who bleached and hid the machete after Mr Seesahai's murder - should be given a \"heavier consideration\" than public interest factors.\n\nMr Lewis, representing the boy who has turned 13 since his conviction, urged the court to focus on the facts of Mr Seesahai's killing rather than \"siren calls\" relating to abstract principles from previous cases.\n\n\"How does naming two 12-year-olds better inform public debate?\" Mr Lewis asked. \"There is no evidence that to name two 12-year-olds would provide any deterrent.\"\n\nNeither of the youths attended Wednesday's hearings.\n\nThe boys' trial was told Mr Seesahai, who was with a friend, was brutally attacked after \"exchanging words\" with one of them near a park bench.\n\nJurors heard the youth who has yet to turn 13 had an obsession with knives - even posing for a picture with the machete, which had a 42.5cm-long blade, hours before he committed murder.\n\nIn social media exchanges involving his co-defendant and a girl witness who later attended a police station with her mother to make a statement, the boy said of the stabbing: \"It is what it is.\"\n\nHe also wrote that he was not scared and added \"idrc\" - text message shorthand for \"I don't really care.\"", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deborah_hardiman@expressandstar.com", "name": "Deborah Hardiman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder of James Bulger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeview_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freeview (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_sentencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mandatory sentencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anonymity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skull fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bilston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bilston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Crown_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Crown Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defense (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife_legislation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knife legislation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shorthand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Brand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Brand"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/v2/TO4B32O33REWDPRPWJ6JVUXMV4.jpg?auth=4258909143b8f523e181bde0cc134454bb75eda004e3cf53cd9f22b1dbb5606e&width=1200&height=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773245", "eventUri": "eng-9773245", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-13", "textStart": 426, "textEnd": 437}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

maintaining the order as it presently is.\"\n\nOne of the youths was present for part of the hearing, while the other did not attend.\n\nBefore adjourning the case, Mrs Justice Tipples made clear that the effect of her ruling on Wednesday is likely to be the subject of a \"stay\" until sentencing on September 26 and 27.\n\nThe \"stay\" would allow lawyers to challenge the ruling in a higher court, the court heard.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Machete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_judge_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court judge (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Crown_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Crown Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skull fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ms", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": ".ms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defense (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Brand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-social behaviour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Img38676361.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773245", "eventUri": "eng-9773245", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-26", "dateEnd": "2024-09-27", "textStart": 3342, "textEnd": 3361}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-13", "textStart": 588, "textEnd": 599}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe grandmother of a killer schoolboy 'intercepted machetes' just six months before the 12-year-old carried out a horror park murder, a court has heard. The child is one of two boys who are facing life sentences for the chilling murder of Shawn Seesahai in Wolverhampton last year.\n\nNottingham Crown Court today (Monday, July 29) heard how one of the boys - who bought the \u00a340 machete wielded during the onslaught - was caught with knives two years before he went on to kill. His grandmother is said to have raised the issue with authorities and 'asked for help'.\n\nShe was also forced out of her home after masked thugs 'on push bikes' turned up outside the property following her grandson's arrest, the court was told. Her comments were raised during a hearing over reporting restrictions currently in place.\n\nREAD MORE: Killer boys, 12, could finally be unmasked as bid to name them starts\n\nDon't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the BirminghamLive newsletter here.\n\nThe killers - who are both 12 - are protected by a court order which gives them anonymity as they are under the age of 18. An application to lift the restrictions and finally identify them to members of the public was heard in court today.\n\nJude Bunting, acting on behalf of media organisations, said evidence provided to the court ahead of the hearing described how the boy's grandmother received unwanted attention outside her home after her grandson was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nShe has since had to move, the court heard. He said: \"It appears that his grandmother already feels under threat.\n\n\"Within weeks of him getting arrested, people were outside the address wearing balaclavas. She said she had to move.\"\n\nBut Mr Bunting argued any risk to the boy's family 'already exists' and lifting reporting restrictions at this stage would not cause a 'real and immediate threat' to his relatives. He also argued there was the 'possibility of institutional failures in this case'.\n\nOne report provided to the court suggested the boy was subject to an assessment in 2023 - in the months before he murdered Mr Seesahai in November that same year. But 'sufficient care was not taken to protect him', he claimed.\n\nHis grandmother also 'intercepted machetes' in the years before the killing - including in May 2023, just six months before Mr Seesahai's murder. Mr Bunting said: \"We can also see in this boy's case, the involvement of his local authority from an early age, his grandmother asking for help in respect of knives from as early as 2021.\"\n\nHe added: \"And yet, he was able to go on and commit this horrific crime. The question which no doubt will be asked is \"why wasn't sufficient care provided to his grandmother so far as to prevent this incident from occurring?\".\n\n\"The local authority will need to review its safeguarding in this case and others in respect of the speed of their decision making.\" During the trial, the boy told jurors how he has lived with his grandmother for 'most of his life' but did not tell her when he bought the murder weapon out of fear of what she would say.\n\nHe described how he purchased the blade from a 'friend of a friend' and armed himself with it because he 'thought he was cool'. Both boys denied murdering their 19-year-old victim in Stowlawn playing fields, East Park.\n\nBut they were unanimously convicted by jurors in June.

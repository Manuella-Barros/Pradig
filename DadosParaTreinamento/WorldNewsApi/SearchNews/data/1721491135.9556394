In its final moments, Francesca was almost too stunned to speak when her new hubby, John, introduced her to his cousin Michaela. And fans of the books were even more shocked than Francesca was, because Michaela doesn\u2019t exist in the novels. Although some loyal readers were upset at the change in Francesca\u2019s love story, the actors and showrunner explained why the gender swap is so special. And even Julia Quinn has made her feelings known. In the Francesca-centric book When He Was Wicked, Francesca mourns the sudden death of John two years after marrying him. As time passes, she starts to realize her feelings for his cousin Michael, and they end up together. However, the show decided to change Michael to Michaela, teasing a queer spin on the book. Showrunner Jess Brownell explained she always felt a queer subtext in Francesca\u2019s story. \u201cThe first time I read Francesca\u2019s book, I really related to it as a queer woman,\u201d Brownell told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cHer book is a lot about how she feels different from her family and from people in society. For some of us, that is a part of the queer experience, not for everyone but for a lot of queer people. It was important to me in creating a queer character not to just drop in a queer character to check a box but to actually tell a story about the queer experience and what it feels like to be queer.\u201d For the part, Brownell cast South African actor Masali Baduza. Hannah Dodd, who plays Francesca, apparently knew she was the perfect choice right from their first chemistry read. \u201cI remember the moment Hannah met Masali. After Masali left, she said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s her.\u2019 Hannah could feel it,\u201d Brownell told Glamour. Simone Ashley, who plays the viscountess Kate Bridgerton, gave Baduza some encouragement. \u201cMany people are going to be so seen by the story that you\u2019re going to be telling,\u201d she said, via People. \u201cI think this is what the world needs more of, more representation.\u201d And yes, Julia Quinn is on board, too. Although the author created the character of Michael Stirling in her books, she was supportive of the choice to portray the character as a woman on screen. \u201cI spoke with Julia Quinn, I got her blessing,\u201d Brownell told Teen Vogue. \u201cWe talked about the fact that with almost any single book, there would be a side of the fandom that would be disheartened to see their favorite characters changed. I don\u2019t think that there is any book that wouldn\u2019t happen with, so for me, again, it came back to story, and it came back to character. Because Francesca\u2019s book resonated [with me] in the way that it did, it felt like a natural adaptation.\u201d \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the fan base is not a monolith, and you\u2019re never going to please every single side of the fan base,\u201d Brownell admitted. Book purists can make all the noise they want, but clearly Michaela Stirling is here to stay, and she\u2019s going to make Francesca\u2019s story even more exciting.", "summary": "Despite some backlash from 'Bridgerton' readers, the show's cast and crew have defended the choice to change the gender of one major character.", "url": "https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/bridgerton-jess-brownell-hannah-dodd-defend-michaela-gender-swap", "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/6/17/aa77616b/masali-baduza-bridgerton-season.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.6492&fp-y=0.3732", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:04:44", "author": "Dylan Kickham", "authors": ["Dylan Kickham"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.034}

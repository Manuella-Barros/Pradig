Now that we are seniors, he has the means and time to take up a lifelong dream of flying a small sport plane. He is taking lessons weekly and loves it.\n\nGreat, you say? Not if you are me. I lost my first husband to a small plane crash that killed him and two of my best friends.\n\nI was left to raise my two young girls by myself. It was hard and tragic.\n\nMy current husband came along when the two girls were nearly grown.\n\nKnowing my history, I can't understand why my current husband would take up flying lessons. It is very distressing for me.\n\nMy logical side says that lightning won't strike twice, but my fear is my fear. I find it most distressing that he won't consider my feelings. Am I being unreasonable?\n\n- Earthbound Wife\n\nDear Wife: You aren't being unreasonable. This is a major source of trauma for you. Even though it was decades ago, you're still processing parts of it. This sort of grief is a lifelong relationship, unfortunately.\n\nIt is, indeed, a relationship that predates your current 27-year marriage.\n\nYour husband doesn't realize that he's not up against airplane safety facts and stats. He's up against decades-old grief.\n\nAsk him to go with you to a few sessions of marriage counseling to have a mediated conversation about the way this hobby is affecting both of you.\n\nThe goal is not to get him to come down or to get you to come around, but for you to be able to meet in the middle.\n\nTalk it out with someone who is trained to guide you through your valid feelings and to guide him through supporting you.\n\nDear Eric: I have a friend I've known for more than 40 years. Communication ebbed and flowed as we moved through various life stages. We live hundreds of miles apart now. Her life has been more tumultuous with the death of her husband plus drug and mental health issues with her children.\n\nRecently, she has distanced herself from me. I respected her wish to be texted ahead of calling to make sure it was a good time. More often than not, she would promise to call in a few days, but didn't. When we did chat it seemed like old times.\n\nOur last contact was a text with her on her birthday last year. She didn't acknowledge my birthday this year. I know her life is still filled with family drama. I wonder if I should even attempt contact with her anymore.\n\n- Distant Friend\n\nDear Friend: Reach out but don't be afraid to ask a \"state of the friendship\" question like \"Does this still work for you?\"\n\nTell her you notice your communication has ebbed. Ask if it's intentional. It's possible - likely - she's just overwhelmed or not a good communicator.

Communication ebbed and flowed as we moved through various life stages. We live hundreds of miles apart now. Her life has been more tumultuous with the death of her husband plus drug and mental health issues with her children.\n\nRecently, she has distanced herself from me. I respected her wish to be texted ahead of calling to make sure it was a good time. More often than not, she would promise to call in a few days, but didn't. When we did chat it seemed like old times.\n\nOur last contact was a text with her on her birthday last year. She didn't acknowledge my birthday this year. I know her life is still filled with family drama. I wonder if I should even attempt contact with her anymore.\n\n-- Distant Friend\n\nDear Friend: Reach out but don't be afraid to ask a \"state of the friendship\" question like \"Does this still work for you?\"\n\nTell her you notice your communication has ebbed. Ask if it's intentional. It's possible - likely - she's just overwhelmed or not a good communicator.

New Market St.\n\nCarmel-based developer Luxe BTR is proposing several single-family housing types within the Luxe Communities of West Carmel development planned southeast of Towne Road and 126th Street.\n\nJim Shinaver, an attorney with Nelson & Frankenberger who is representing Luxe BTR, said the development would provide rental types not readily available in Carmel.\n\n\"The concept addresses a wide range of housing needs and preferences throughout Carmel and northern Hamilton County for those seeking a luxury single-family rental option,\" Shinaver said.\n\nHe said developers believe it will be an attractive option for some residents looking to relocate within the community.\n\n\"We do expect many to be current Carmel residents who want to stay in Carmel but for stage-of life-considerations are seeking alternatives to home ownership, with ease of maintenance as the leading reason for considering a community like the one being proposed,\" Shinaver stated.\n\nThe development would be the first of its type for Luxe BTR, according to Shinaver.\n\nLuxe BTR plans to file a petition with the City of Carmel to rezone the land but has not yet done so. The Carmel Plan Commission votes on rezone requests before sending them to the Carmel City Council for a final decision.\n\nMore Headlines Enhancing education: Zionsville teachers earn thousands in grant funds Happy Trails: Conner Prairie's new trails system part of its Prairie Pathways Campaign Golden milestone: CCS recognizes Carmel High School alum for 50 years of service as science teacher, bus driver Summer repaving projects begin in May in Westfield Carmel in brief -- May 7, 2024 Letter: Help Stamp Out Hunger May 11", "source": {"uri": "youarecurrent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Current Publishing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "current_publishing@youarecurrent.com", "name": "Current Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTR_(vehicle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BTR (vehicle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carmel, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carmel, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Market,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Market, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Market, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel_High_School_(Indiana)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmel High School (Indiana)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Trails_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Happy Trails (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conner_Prairie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conner Prairie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westfield, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westfield, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionsville,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionsville, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zionsville, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmel City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carmel City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Intentional_Communities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Intentional Communities", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://youarecurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CIC-COM-0514-Luxe-Meeting.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553952", "eventUri": "eng-9553952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 110, "textEnd": 115}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1939, "textEnd": 1945}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

According to Livability.com's newest list of the best small to mid-size cities to live in America, Carmel, a community in Hamilton County, Indiana, ranked the highest for housing, health, and economy.\n\nThe website considered over 2,000 cities with populations between 75,000 and 500,000 and then compared those in eight categories, including housing and cost of living, amenities, transportation, environment, education, and safety.\n\n\"Roughly 30 minutes outside of Indianapolis is Carmel, Indiana, a picturesque city with a stellar arts scene and top-rated schools. Carmel embraces quality of life, and residents in this tight-knit community have access to plenty of cultural events and outdoor activities,\" the website notes.\n\nLivability only ranks destinations where the median home value is $500,000 or less, and in Carmel, house prices stand at $380,000, while the median monthly rent is $1,177. At the same time, the median household income in the city is about twice the national average, or $151,115. Livability notes this is due to the city's thriving economy and highlights Carmel's Meridian Corporate Corridor, home to over 100 corporate headquarters. The city is also a hotspot for retail activity, thanks to shopping centers like Clay Terrace, Old Town Carmel, and Village Park Plaza.\n\nTop-notch entertainment and recreation are part of Carmel's appeal to newcomers. Residents benefit from a robust year-round calendar of events like theater productions, concerts, and festivals, and they can also explore over 200 creative-focused businesses, such as galleries and independent boutiques, in Carmel's arts and design district. And with 700 acres worth of green spaces, parks, and trails, the city is sure to please outdoor enthusiasts, too.\n\nCarmel also scored a high result in the education category, which measures school quality, college access, and years of school. According to Niche.com, Carmel has some of Indiana's top public and private schools, while CollegeSimply.com notes there are over 30 colleges within 50 miles of the city.\n\nEarlier this year, Carmel was also named the best suburb in America by Niche.com and the No. 1 city for families in Indiana.\n\nBroomfield in Colorado scored second-best on Livability's best places to live list.

With this being my biggest role, it can be challenging at times, but the process is extremely rewarding, and I have so much to look forward to.\"\n\nCahn, a Carmel resident, will share the title role with Carmel High School sophomore Sienna Paquette in the Central Indiana Dance Ensemble's production of \"Snow White\" May 18-19 at The Tarkington at the Center for the Performing Arts in Carmel.

Cahn's performances are set for 7:30 p.m. May 18 and 1 p.m. May 19.\n\n\"These two girls have great work ethics in both classes and rehearsals, where they spend over 20 hours a week,\" CIDE Co-Artistic Director Ashley Jacobs said. \"With 'Snow White' being a storybook ballet, the acting is an important aspect of the role, and both Sienna and Sophia have great confidence and stage presence needed for this role.\"\n\nPaquette said Snow White has to go through many emotions as the story progresses. Paquette said she looks forward to the challenge because it is her first lead role in CIDE's spring ballet.\n\n\"This is the biggest role I have had in the company, which results in long rehearsals multiple days a week,\" Paquette said. \"I am honored to perform the role of Snow White. With it comes many challenges, learning more about the importance of technique and artistry to entertain the audience. (It's) much different than dancing in the corps de ballet, where the audience's focus is toward the soloist. I also needed to learn more about pas de deux, or dancing with a partner. This role has allowed me to grow substantially as a dancer.\"\n\nFor more, visit cidedance.org.\n\nMore Headlines Sobering lessons: Westfield High School students experience impaired driving simulation Community meeting May 7 to discuss build-to-rent neighborhood proposed in west Carmel Ballet Theatre of Carmel Academy graduates return in 'The Firebird' Golden milestone: CCS recognizes Carmel High School alum for 50 years of service as science teacher, bus driver 'Cinderella' right fit for Carmel High School senior Carmel in brief -- May 7, 2024", "source": {"uri": "youarecurrent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Current Publishing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_ambrogi@youarecurrent.com", "name": "Mark Ambrogi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snow White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centro_de_Investigaci\u00f3n_y_Docencia_Econ\u00f3micas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carmel, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carmel, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel_High_School_(Indiana)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carmel High School (Indiana)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Firebird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Firebird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield_High_School_(New_Jersey)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westfield High School (New Jersey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corps_de_ballet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corps de ballet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solo (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pas_de_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pas de deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Performing Arts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://youarecurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ND-CIDE-0514-Cahn-photo-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553952", "eventUri": "eng-9553952", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "dateEnd": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 620, "textEnd": 629}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "dateEnd": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 725, "textEnd": 737}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "dateEnd": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 793, "textEnd": 805}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 743, "textEnd": 749, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2043, "textEnd": 2048}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Seven large for-sale homes are planned on 12 acres to the south, including one already on the property that would be preserved along with an existing barn.\n\nBrad Richey of Carmel and Jason Brown of Zionsville are the principals of Luxe BTR, which was founded in 2023. Richey has more than 30 years of multi-family development experience with Pearl Real Estate Companies, and Brown is an investment banker with Berkadia. Luxe Communities of West Carmel is the first build-to-rent project for Richey and Brown.\n\nLuxe BTR plans to file a request with the City of Carmel May 15 to rezone the land to a planned unit development, meaning development standards would be specific to the project and must be approved by the Carmel City Council. The VOWC is zoned as a PUD, and Luxe BTR plans to base the style of the homes and other standards on the VOWC PUD. The PUD standards and any associated commitments would remain in place for any future owners of the site and could only be changed with approval from the city council.\n\nSeveral attendees at the community meeting, held at the VOWC Meeting House, questioned the ownership structure of Luxe BTR and its financing for the project.\n\nBrown said developers \"don't have financing lined up yet\" because the project is still in the early stages. Richey described Luxe BTR as a general partnership and said he and Brown are meeting with potential investors.\n\n\"We are in active discussions with investors who will invest in this and then in the equity stack, so to speak,\" Richey said. \"There will also be traditional financing put on the project as well.\"\n\nRichey said research shows that nearly 60 percent of those living in build-to-rent communities rent by choice and that residents tend to stay there longer as opposed to other rental options, such as apartments. He said build-to-rent neighborhoods have grown in popularity across the U.S. in recent years.\n\n\"Through all the surveys, the No. 1 reason for wanting to rent in one of these communities is for ease of maintenance,\" Richey said.\n\nHe also said that many people choosing build-to-rent neighborhoods are empty nesters, so half of the rental homes in Luxe Communities of West Carmel will have master bedrooms on the first floor.\n\nHowever, several attendees at the meeting said they didn't believe the community as proposed is designed primarily for empty nesters, as only 16 dwellings are set to be a single story. One resident at the meeting said the project appeared to be a \"bait and switch.\"\n\nOther attendees raised concerns about traffic, possible use of VOWC amenities by Luxe Communities residents leading to increased maintenance costs and a lack of experience by the developers in constructing a build-to-rent community. The majority of attendees who spoke or asked questions at the meeting did not support development as proposed.\n\nThe Carmel Plan Commission is expected to review the project at its July meeting, and it is expected to be discussed in depth by a plan commission committee. The plan commission would hold a public hearing on the rezone request before voting on it.

Both teams advanced by winning a regional competition.\n\nSycamore School placed seventh in the middle school team division in the National Science Bowl,, which was held April 25-29 in Leesburg, Va. Sycamore went undefeated in the morning portion of the middle school tournament, earning a spot in the afternoon double-elimination bracket.\n\nThe team finished 9-2 and earned $1,000 for their school. Sycamore finished third in the Cyber Science Challenge competition for only middle school teams, which consisted of a series of computational algorithms and \"Jeopardy!\"-style questions that the teams solved using math, programming and logic. The team earned $500 for their school for that finish.\n\nThe Sycamore team included Carmel residents Shayen Maun, Gavin Sigua and Justin Warren and Fishers residents Allison Jeray and Alex Bramhill. Jeray is a sixth-grader and the others are eighth-graders. Sycamore finished fifth in 2022 and 2023. The team's best finish was second in 2016.\n\nCoach David Schuth, a science teacher at Sycamore, said the key was the students' motivation.\n\n\"We did a lot of studying and we were practicing three times a week,\" he said.\n\nSchuth said the experience was fantastic for the students.\n\n\"They're learning about the world around them, whether it's through the knowledge they're picking up or interacting with kids all over the nation who are like them interested in science and how the world works,\" Schuth said.\n\nCHS went 5-2 in the morning portion of the high school tournament to advance to the afternoon double-elimination bracket. The team ended 6-4, earning a top 24 finish overall.\n\nThe team members were Kevin Hu, Yash Bhargava, Edward Chen and Adam Madni.\n\n\"The students really worked hard to win regionals and prepare for nationals,\" CHS coach Dawn Laumeyer said. \"We have two seniors, Kevin and Yash, who will be leaving the team this year. So, Edward and Adam will take over. The kids had a blast at nationals. They met new friends and ate really well. The first round of round-robin was rough. But, they bounced back for all but one of the remaining rounds. They won the first round of double-elimination, but lost the next two rounds. Ironically, the team we won against in round-robin is the one that finished us off in double-elimination. Edward is very strong in math and physics. Adam's wheelhouse is chemistry and physics. Kevin is really good at math and Yash's strength is biology. I keep telling them they are the smartest four young men I know.\"\n\nThe National Science Bowl has been sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. The competition tests students' knowledge in all areas of math and science, including biology, chemistry, Earth science, physics and energy.\n\nMore Headlines Sobering lessons: Westfield High School

Having moved from the area to San Francisco to pursue graphic design, he sensed when he quit his job to return to his community to paint full-time, no one would remember who he was.\n\nUntil he was juried into the Art Festival, one of the chosen to compete in the plein-air painting competition. And then he won the \"People's Choice Award,\" the one painters hope for, the one chosen by collectors and spectators who are drawn to the image, the palette, the style, the mood, the one people want on their wall.\n\n\"Winning the 'People's Choice Award' is not only validating; it gets you into marketing materials in the following festival,\" Turner said. \"The next year, my winning painting showed up on T-shirts and posters, helping me get recognition, a name for myself in Carmel. It was a turning point in my career.\"\n\nJoaquin Turner admits he feels a little spoiled to live in the community that hosts the competition, giving him a \"hometown advantage\" over other artists who travel from all over the country and even Europe to compete, arriving just in time to paint.\n\n\"Living here, I have a chance to stake out special areas to paint,\" he said. \"This year, there is a particular place in Point Lobos that caught my eye, and a spot on Pescadero Point in Pebble Beach, and maybe the dunes in Marina. A lot of it depends on the weather and the light. Sometimes I'm driving to my destination and, along the way, the light is so special, I just stop there.\"\n\nWhen painting plein air during the festival, Pebble Beach artist Coraly Hanson, who has won the Festival's People's Choice Award more than once, is looking forward to the \"divine appointments\" that show up throughout the weekend. She's referring to the people she meets and engages with, those who watch her paint, those who attend the festival events, and fellow artists who are out there, painting along with her.\n\n\"I don't take these interactions lightly,\" Hanson said. \"I absolutely love to paint, but people matter more. I'm looking forward to being pushed along by the inspiration of other artists, the beauty of the environment, and whomever God is going to send me to connect with. I'll be painting in Point Lobos -- my favorite place on the planet -- for part of the time. My subject matter will depend on what I feel and the mood of the weather.\"\n\nFigurative art takes on a broader meaning when used to honor prominent people in the community. Public events throughout the three-day festival commence in Devendorf Park on May 17, heralded by the annual Sculpture in the Park demonstration, featuring Steven Whyte, a British-born sculptor and renowned master of the craft, who trained at the prestigious Sir Henry Doulton School of Sculpture in England.\n\nThis year, Whyte will unveil an important new work, a life-size figure of John Madden (1936-2021). He began the piece during last year's festival, inviting viewers to guess who he was portraying as he worked. Having completed the sculpture, Whyte will present and install it outside Bruno's Market in Carmel, where the legendary pro football Hall of Famer, coach, and NFL sports commentator enjoyed sitting on the bench, having a sandwich, and engaging with passersby in his favorite community.\n\n\"Each year for the festival,\" said Whyte, \"I try to create a sculpture with a strong connection to Carmel. I think it's beyond fitting that Coach Madden is the first of these figures that will have a permanent home in Carmel. John Madden was a fierce friend, a gentle neighbor, a kind-hearted member of the community. He loved Carmel, and now Carmel is returning that sentiment with this tribute.\"\n\nLast year, his wife Virginia Madden and their two sons, Joseph and Michael, came to Whyte's studio while he was working on his sculpture of Madden. Whyte recalls, \"On their third visit she said, 'That's him; he's back.' What an honor.\"\n\nDuring the unveiling ceremony, the community will be joined by Whyte, members of the Madden family, and representatives from sponsoring organization Carmel Cares, among them, Dale Byrne, president and chief caring officer for the organization.\n\nThrough his efforts to honor a prominent person associated with Carmel, while onlookers try to guess who is emerging in his work, Steven Whyte also has sculpted the likes of Betty White, Doris Day, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and more.\n\nThis year, Whyte also is working on a two-figure piece, portraying legendary golf course designer Alister MacKenzie and his colleague, celebrated female golfer Marion Hollins, the 1921 U.S. Women's Amateur Champion. A pioneering golf course designer herself, she was known, as the pair toured the grounds planning a new course -- among them Cypress Point and Pasatiempo -- for teeing off to determine the appropriate placement and design of each hole.\n\n\"I will sculpt separate figures of Alister and Marion,\" said Whyte, \"based on a historical photo of them on the golf course. During the festival, people will be able to see how the composition develops. Then I'll finish it back in the studio. The sculpture will be cast in bronze and ultimately installed on the first tee at Pasatiempo Golf Club in Santa Cruz next spring.\"\n\nThe Carmel Art Festival will culminate in Devendorf Park, with a plein-air painters awards ceremony at 5:30 p.m. The Friday evening events conclude with a reception for artists and collectors, featuring live music from festival headliner Carlos Reyes, plus food from local restaurants and wine from Carmel wineries. Admittance to the reception is free with the purchase of a painting, or the public can purchase tickets to the Gala at the Park for a $40 donation to the Art Festival and its scholarship program for students pursuing the arts.\n\n\"Plein-air paintings will be on display in the park on Saturday and Sunday, as the festival continues with a series of events for the community,\" said Art Festival Co-Chair Ellen Wilson, \"including live musical performances and children's art workshops, with representatives from California State Parks and Costanzo Creative. Salinas-based artist Ariel Mar will host a screen-printing session, where attendees can personalize festival merchandise on both Saturday and Sunday.\"\n\nThe annual Quick-Draw Competition is scheduled Sunday, with select artists challenged to create works of art in just 30 minutes. The \"fast fine art\" will become available for purchase through a silent auction on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"The Carmel Art Festival is a 501c-3 non-profit, committed to supporting Carmel's rich artistic history and supporting the next generation of artists,\" Wilson said. \"Proceeds from this year's festival will support the festival's newly launched Carmel Art Festival Scholarship, which provides financial assistance to local students interested in studying the arts as part of their college experience.\"\n\nAs Festival Co-Chair Hella Rothwell said, \"Art is meant to be shared. Art helps to build community. We are grateful to live in a community that recognizes this symbiotic relationship. This is the spirit we celebrate annually through the Carmel Art Festival.\"\n\nCurrent Festival Sponsors include: Arts Council of Monterey County, The Barnyard Shopping Village, Bernardus Winery, Carmel Cares, Carmel Coffee House, Carmel Gives, Cypress Inn, Dawn's Dream Winery, Esperanza Carmel, Forage Vintage Rental Company, Jacquie Adams, Realtor, Sotheby's International Realty, Monterey History and Art Association, Oscar's Playground, The Party Se\u00f1orita, Printworks Solutions, Steven Whyte Sculpture Studios, Rothwell Realty, Inc., Terry and Paula Trotter of Trotter Galleries, The Cities of Carmel and Pacific Grove, UPS stores of the Monterey Peninsula, and The Wecker Group.\n\nAdditional information about the Festival, including a complete list of participating artists and the full Festival Schedule, can be found at www.carmelartfestivalcalifornia.com.", "source": {"uri": "montereyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Monterey Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_crawford_watson@montereyherald.com", "name": "Lisa Crawford Watson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Whyte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven Whyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Madden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Madden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Choice_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Choice Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

We must never forget these atrocities, the evils that made them possible -- poisonous ideologies, antisemitism, racism and xenophobia that dehumanize so many people. Silence and inaction in the face of such hatred enabled these horrors.\"\n\nFinkam said everyone has a moral obligation to ensure nothing like it ever happens again.\n\n\"On this day, we recommit ourselves to combat prejudice, hatred and oppression in all its forms through education, vigilance and especially compassion,\" she said.\n\nFinkam said the victims and lessons from the Holocaust can never be forgotten.\n\nThe keynote presentation was Carmel High School freshman Sadie Cohen's narration of \"Anne Frank's Tree,\" accompanied by the Indianapolis Chamber Orchestra. It was composed by Victoria Bond.\n\nCarmel Symphony Orchestra's violinist Amanda Baer and pianist Rebecca Edie performed \"Theme from Schindler's List.\"\n\nCarmel resident Jay Dorman spoke about his relatives fleeing Lithuania before Germany invaded it in 1941.\n\n\"Had they stayed, the chances are slim that I would be standing here today, as 90 percent of the quarter-million Lithuanian Jews perished at the hands of the Nazis and their sympathizers,\" Dorman said. \"So, I must continually challenge myself, how can I maximize my good luck to be here today and somehow, some way make this world a better place?\"\n\nDorman shared President Ronal Reagan's speech dedicating the construction of the United States Holocaust Museum in 1988.\n\nMore Headlines Quite a catch: Indy-based shrimp

Women's play-in games are at the same campus sites as the first two rounds of the tournament.\n\nExpansion is largely backed by larger conferences and smaller leagues do not want to lose the automatic bids that come with a conference tournament championship or face the prospect of always being slotted for the play-in games.\n\nThe earliest the NCAA Tournament could expand would be the 2025-26 season, the person told AP.

The news was first reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nUnder the proposal, expansion of the 68-team field included both four- and eight-team models. The NCAA would keep its 64-team bracket but would add play-in games involving the 10 through 12 seeds.\n\nIf the men's tournament were to expand it is expected the women's tourney would as well.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Burton) among stars in FCA All-Star Game Follow the yellow brick road to the Gilliam Stage this summer\n\nThere are many in college basketball who have said they believe the 68-team fields and three weekends of play are ideal but pressure has grown to add teams and games to one of the most popular sports events on the U.S. calendar. Last year, the NCAA Division I board of directors approved recommendations that included allowing one quarter of teams in larger sports to compete in championship events; in that scenario, March Madness tourneys could expand to nearly 90 teams.\n\nThe NCAA is currently in the midst of an eight-year extension of its TV deal for the men's tournament worth $8.8 billion that runs through 2032. That would not be expected to change if a handful of teams are added.\n\nMore games would provide a small boost through ticket sales and merchandise, but the pool of money the NCAA uses to pay out conferences and member schools would essentially stay the same. What could change, however, is how that money would be divided up if the tournament broadens.\n\nExpansion would also mean the men's tournament would have to find an additional site besides Dayton for its First Four games. The Ohio city already has games on Tuesday and Wednesday and wouldn't be able to host additional play-in games ahead of the tourney's traditional first-round opening on Thursday. Women's play-in games are at the same campus sites as the first two rounds of the tournament.\n\nExpansion is largely backed by larger conferences and smaller leagues do not want to lose the automatic bids that come with a conference tournament championship or face the prospect of always being slotted for the play-in games.\n\nThe earliest the NCAA Tournament could expand would be the 2025-26 season, the person told AP. The NCAA basketball oversight committee meets next week and the tournament selection committee has a meeting next month.\n\nThe men's tournament last expanded in 2011 when it went from 64 to 68 teams. The women's tournament matched that in 2022.\n\nThe women's tournament is coming off its most successful year ever that included a record audience of 18.7 million for the title game win by South Carolina over Iowa, the highest for a basketball broadcast of any kind in five years. It outdrew the men's championship game -- UConn winning its second consecutive title with a win over Purdue -- by nearly 3 million viewers. The women's tournament also had record attendance.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

The news was first reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nUnder the proposal, expansion of the 68-team field included both four- and eight-team models. The NCAA would keep its 64-team bracket but would add play-in games involving the 10 through 12 seeds.\n\nIf the men's tournament were to expand it is expected the women's tourney would as well.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nCHP: Angwin woman dies after car strikes her on driveway Suspect named in fatal Napa County hit-and-run crash Napa Valley College's new student housing: How much will it cost?

Last year, the NCAA Division I board of directors approved recommendations that included allowing one quarter of teams in larger sports to compete in championship events; in that scenario, March Madness tourneys could expand to nearly 90 teams.\n\nThe NCAA is currently in the midst of an eight-year extension of its TV deal for the men's tournament worth $8.8 billion that runs through 2032. That would not be expected to change if a handful of teams are added.\n\nMore games would provide a small boost through ticket sales and merchandise, but the pool of money the NCAA uses to pay out conferences and member schools would essentially stay the same. What could change, however, is how that money would be divided up if the tournament broadens.\n\nExpansion would also mean the men's tournament would have to find an additional site besides Dayton for its First Four games. The Ohio city already has games on Tuesday and Wednesday and wouldn't be able to host additional play-in games ahead of the tourney's traditional first-round opening on Thursday. Women's play-in games are at the same campus sites as the first two rounds of the tournament.\n\nExpansion is largely backed by larger conferences and smaller leagues do not want to lose the automatic bids that come with a conference tournament championship or face the prospect of always being slotted for the play-in games.\n\nThe earliest the NCAA Tournament could expand would be the 2025-26 season, the person told AP. The NCAA basketball oversight committee meets next week and the tournament selection committee has a meeting next month.\n\nThe men's tournament last expanded in 2011 when it went from 64 to 68 teams. The women's tournament matched that in 2022.\n\nThe women's tournament is coming off its most successful year ever that included a record audience of 18.7 million for the title game win by South Carolina over Iowa, the highest for a basketball broadcast of any kind in five years. It outdrew the men's championship game -- UConn winning its second consecutive title with a win over Purdue -- by nearly 3 million viewers. The women's tournament also had record attendance.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

Officials declined to speak publicly about the models.\n\nThe models would expand the 68-team field to 72 or 76 teams, with additional at-large selections as well as at least one additional First Four site. Any expansion would begin, at earliest, in the 2025-26 season. If the men's event expands, the women's tournament is likely to undergo a similar expansion.\n\nDan Gavitt, NCAA vice president for the men's basketball championship, unveiled the models in a presentation Wednesday at the commissioners' annual summer meeting. In the culmination of months of work, Gavitt outlined possibilities for what commissioners believe to be an inevitable expansion of the men's event -- a movement mostly championed by the power conferences, something Yahoo Sports reported in February.\n\nAs a way to avoid eliminating any of the 28 small-conference automatic qualifiers -- a time-honored and popular concept with fans -- NCAA and conference leaders are targeting the addition of at-large selections as has been done in the past. The last expansion, in 2011, added four at-large teams and created the First Four in Dayton, Ohio, where two pairings of 16 seeds and two pairings of at-large selections meet in play-in games.\n\nAny new expansion to the field is expected to result in at least one additional First Four site, perhaps in a Western time zone. But expanding the tournament -- by even just four teams -- is a complex issue.\n\nOfficials are planning to retain the current 64-team bracket. With play-in game winners needing a spot in that structure, space has to be made. More 10-12 seeds, originally in the 64-team bracket, could find themselves having to win play-in games on that Tuesday or Wednesday to advance to the first round on Thursday or Friday.\n\nMore tough decisions lie ahead as well. Officials need to determine if more small-conference automatic qualifiers will be relegated to play-in games -- a sensitive subject for some commissioners of lower-resourced leagues.\n\nThere's something else, too: Will the additional games generate more revenue? It remains an unanswered question. CBS and Turner are not required to increase the amount in which they pay, according to those with knowledge of the contract.\n\nGavitt's modeling of a possible expanded field is one step in an approval process that could take many more months as commissioners explore altering what's widely known as the most popular event in college athletics -- and in American sports. Various groups are scheduled to examine the expansion modeling over this summer and fall, including meetings of the NCAA basketball oversight committee next week and a meeting of the NCAA basketball selection committee set for next month.\n\nThe basketball tournament is the NCAA's largest and most vital revenue stream, keeping afloat the organization itself as well as helping subsidize hundreds of small-college athletic departments. As part of a tournament television deal with CBS and Turner running through 2032, the NCAA distributes annually around $700 million to its schools, both in base amounts and in units earned through advancing in the event.\n\nWhile much of that revenue goes to the power conferences, leaders of the Big Ten, SEC, ACC and Big 12 have publicly expressed a desire to expand the field of 36 at-large selections to open a pathway for more of their schools. This spring, commissioners held multiple meetings with NCAA president Charlie Baker about tournament expansion, strongly encouraging the NCAA to find a way to grow the field.\n\n\"I want to see the best teams competing for a national championship, no different than [the Big Ten and SEC] want to see in football,\" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark told Yahoo Sports in February. \"I'm not sure that is currently happening.\"\n\nACC commissioner Jim Phillips believes that a \"holistic review\" of the tournament is necessary, and SEC commissioner Greg Sankey has suggested an expansion of the field multiple times over the past two years.\n\nExpansion is nothing new for the event. In 1975, the tournament expanded to include 32 teams to allow a second team to represent a conference in addition to its champion. In 1979, it grew to 40 teams and then to 48 in 1980. In 1985, the tournament moved to 64 teams, and in 2001, the tournament expanded by a single team to create a play-in game before the 2011 expansion to 68.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_dellenger@aol.com", "name": "Ross Dellenger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Four", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Four"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-large", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "At-large"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(tournament)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bracket (tournament)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dayton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dayton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Baker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Baker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/College and University", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4OceLk1U7EWVjx7XSNklXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/0e277e2b71cdcf75f89a538b09425d1a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666288", "eventUri": "eng-9666288", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 113, "textEnd": 120}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

If passed, the NCAA's plans for tournament expansion would not take effect until at least the 2025-26 season.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Sports, the presented changes would keep the core 64-team bracket intact, adding additional play-in games and at least one more First Four site. Expansion to the women's tournament could follow suit.\n\nThe NCAA Tournament field was expanded from 65 to 68 in 2011 and from 64 to 65 in 2001. The alteration to the event's core bracket came in 1985 when it expanded from 53 teams to 64.\n\nAdditional tournament games could be a way to increase revenue as schools seek to offset financial costs of the recent House v. NCAA decision. There's also realignment to consider. With the Big 12, ACC, SEC and Big Ten all adding teams in 2024-25, those conferences will have fewer at-large bids to share under the current structure. Tournament expansion could help compensate for that without scrapping auto bids for smaller leagues.\n\n\"The tournament is one of the greatest spectacles in sports,\" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark told CBS Sports in May. \"It captivates hardcore fans and casual fans for all the right reasons, and you don't want to mess with something that's great, but if there are chances and opportunities to modify a little bit, to maybe provide more access, to amplify the experience, to look at it slightly differently, we owe it to ourselves to do that. I'm a firm believer that from time to time, you've got to put things through an audit. As great as they might look, it makes sense to do that and go through that exercise.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_salerno@cbssports.com", "name": "Cameron Salerno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Four", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Four"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/02/14/292ab218-bcb8-4f7e-9c84-50510af7fe36/thumbnail/1200x675/2d94a805b947caf863dbf61a9f546407/usatsi-17918451-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666288", "eventUri": "eng-9666288", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The news was first reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nUnder the proposal, expansion of the 68-team field included both four- and eight-team models. The NCAA would keep its 64-team bracket but would add play-in games involving the 10 through 12 seeds.\n\nIf the men's tournament were to expand it is expected the women's tourney would as well.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Last year, the NCAA Division I board of directors approved recommendations that included allowing one quarter of teams in larger sports to compete in championship events; in that scenario, March Madness tourneys could expand to nearly 90 teams.\n\nThe NCAA is currently in the midst of an eight-year extension of its TV deal for the men's tournament worth $8.8 billion that runs through 2032. That would not be expected to change if a handful of teams are added.\n\nMore games would provide a small boost through ticket sales and merchandise, but the pool of money the NCAA uses to pay out conferences and member schools would essentially stay the same. What could change, however, is how that money would be divided up if the tournament broadens.\n\nExpansion would also mean the men's tournament would have to find an additional site besides Dayton for its First Four games. The Ohio city already has games on Tuesday and Wednesday and wouldn't be able to host additional play-in games ahead of the tourney's traditional first-round opening on Thursday. Women's play-in games are at the same campus sites as the first two rounds of the tournament.\n\nExpansion is largely backed by larger conferences and smaller leagues do not want to lose the automatic bids that come with a conference tournament championship or face the prospect of always being slotted for the play-in games.\n\nThe earliest the NCAA Tournament could expand would be the 2025-26 season, the person told AP. The NCAA basketball oversight committee meets next week and the tournament selection committee has a meeting next month.\n\nThe men's tournament last expanded in 2011 when it went from 64 to 68 teams. The women's tournament matched that in 2022.\n\nThe women's tournament is coming off its most successful year ever that included a record audience of 18.7 million for the title game win by South Carolina over Iowa, the highest for a basketball broadcast of any kind in five years. It outdrew the men's championship game -- UConn winning its second consecutive title with a win over Purdue -- by nearly 3 million viewers. The women's tournament also had record attendance.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

Both feature additional at-large bids and at least one more First Four game site. The expanded tournament would start at the earliest for the 2025-26 season, according to multiple Division I commissioners.\n\nYahoo first reported about the presentation.\n\nTalks about the NCAA Tournament size and structure grew louder this spring, drawing blowback from traditionalists. The Athletic reported in March that a 72- or 76-team tournament looked like the likeliest outcome for expansion from 68. A college administrator briefed on expansion conversations told The Athletic in March that \"there is little to no appetite\" for a bracket featuring an even larger field.\n\n\"The NCAA has to be proactive,\" the source said. \"Expansion -- modest expansion -- may be the only way to keep the tournament we all know and love alive.\"\n\nThe NCAA Tournament would maintain its 64-team bracket under the proposed models, meaning either more at-large teams seeded Nos. 10-12 or small-conference automatic qualifiers would need to win a First Four game to solidify their spot in the Round of 64, according to the multiple commissioners. An expanded tournament would have two or four First Four sites spaced out geographically.\n\nMore games would not immediately mean more revenue. According to Yahoo, CBS and Turner -- which hold rights to the men's tournament until 2032 -- are not required to increase how much they pay alongside an uptick in games.\n\nIf the men's tournament expands, it is expected the women's tournament would follow. The NCAA has been seeking feedback on the subject for months and will continue to do so. The NCAA Division I basketball committees will also need to be involved in final decision-making.\n\nThe men's tournament has expanded gradually since its debut in 1939, which had just eight teams. It most recently added three teams to go to 68 in 2011.

The news was first reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nUnder the proposal, expansion of the 68-team field included both four- and eight-team models. The NCAA would keep its 64-team bracket but would add play-in games involving the 10 through 12 seeds.\n\nIf the men's tournament were to expand it is expected the women's tourney would as well.\n\nThere are many in college basketball who have said they believe the 68-team fields and three weekends of play are ideal but pressure has grown to add teams and games to one of the most popular sports events on the U.S. calendar. Last year, the NCAA Division I board of directors approved recommendations that included allowing one quarter of teams in larger sports to compete in championship events; in that scenario, March Madness tourneys could expand to nearly 90 teams.\n\nThe NCAA is currently in the midst of an eight-year extension of its TV deal for the men's tournament worth $8.8 billion that runs through 2032. That would not be expected to change if a handful of teams are added.\n\nMore games would provide a small boost through ticket sales and merchandise, but the pool of money the NCAA uses to pay out conferences and member schools would essentially stay the same. What could change, however, is how that money would be divided up if the tournament broadens.\n\nExpansion would also mean the men's tournament would have to find an additional site besides Dayton for its First Four games. The Ohio city already has games on Tuesday and Wednesday and wouldn't be able to host additional play-in games ahead of the tourney's traditional first-round opening on Thursday. Women's play-in games are at the same campus sites as the first two rounds of the tournament.\n\nExpansion is largely backed by larger conferences and smaller leagues do not want to lose the automatic bids that come with a conference tournament championship or face the prospect of always being slotted for the play-in games.\n\nThe earliest the NCAA Tournament could expand would be the 2025-26 season, the person told AP. The NCAA basketball oversight committee meets next week and the tournament selection committee has a meeting next month.\n\nThe men's tournament last expanded in 2011 when it went from 64 to 68 teams. The women's tournament matched that in 2022.\n\nThe women's tournament is coming off its most successful year ever that included a record audience of 18.7 million for the title game win by South Carolina over Iowa, the highest for a basketball broadcast of any kind in five years. It outdrew the men's championship game -- UConn winning its second consecutive title with a win over Purdue -- by nearly 3 million viewers. The women's tournament also had record attendance.\n\n___\n\nAP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_at_the_1964_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Four", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Four"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_at_the_1968_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dayton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dayton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/20240620120652-66745eb32863b2db9eafdf32jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666288", "eventUri": "eng-9666288", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Patrick Gorski-USA TODAY Sports / Patrick Gorski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMarch Madness is one of the most exciting events in sports, and it could look different in the near future.\n\nOn Wednesday, NCAA officials revealed models for potential expansion of the NCAA Tournament, according to a report from Yahoo's Ross Dellenger. The potential alterations to college basketball's biggest stage featured two models, consisting of an additional four or eight teams.\n\nAfter much criticism about potentially eliminating automatic bids for teams that win their conference, the models presented Wednesday included the additions of strictly at-large teams. However, adding at-large teams would expand the field to 72 or 76 teams and would require more play-in games. Currently, there are only four play-in games at the First Four, including only four at-large teams.\n\nREAD MORE: Oklahoma State Receives Commitment From Three-Star Safety Ayden Webb\n\nAny changes to the men's college basketball tournament would not begin until the 2025-26 season at the earliest. Dellenger reports that the women's tournament could also undergo changes if the men's tournament changes.\n\nTalk of the potential expansion of the NCAA Tournament comes shortly after the expansion of the College Football Playoff from four teams to 12, which will begin next season.\n\nAlthough Oklahoma State has not seen the NCAA Tournament much over the past several seasons, these potential changes could help the Cowboys get in. As Steve Lutz takes over in Stillwater, OSU is looking to make it to the tournament for the first time since 2021 and the second time since 2017.\n\nAs Lutz builds a roster for next season through the transfer portal, retaining players who came to Stillwater this season and adding high school recruits will be significant pieces of the puzzle if OSU wants to make an expanded tournament.

If passed, the main 64-team bracket would remain intact while additional play-in games and at least one more First Four site would be included. The women's tournament could follow suit as well.\n\nThe proposed changes to one of the most unique tournaments in U.S. sports wouldn't take effect until the 2025-26 season.\n\nThe latest discussion surrounding NCAA Tournament expansion comes in wake of the NCAA's landmark multi-billion dollar settlement in the House v. NCAA antitrust case. Adding more postseason games to create more revenue could be a way to help offset the reported $2.8 billion in damages owed to thousands of current and former student-athletes over the next 10 years. Roughly $1.65 billion of that is from a reduction in school distributions.\n\nConference realignment has also greatly changed the landscape of college athletics. As the Big 12, ACC, SEC and Big Ten all add teams starting next season, there are concerns that there will be fewer bids to go around to the power conference schools.\n\n\"It's [the NCAA Tournament] such a great entity right now,\" Gonzaga men's basketball coach Mark Few said on an episode of Gonzaga Nation. \"For that first week or two, it's the greatest sporting event out there.\"\n\n\"You don't wanna lessen the regular season,\" Few said. \"I understand what some of the thought processes are. There is great parity happening. It's getting harder and harder to maybe choose the 68. But at the same time when you go through the mock, well here's who would've got in if we went to 96, it would just make the regular season not nearly as important and probably not very watchable a lot of times.

The news was first reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nUnder the proposal, expansion of the 68-team field included both four- and eight-team models. The NCAA would keep its 64-team bracket but would add play-in games involving the 10 through 12 seeds.\n\nIf the men's tournament were to expand it is expected the women's tourney would as well.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Last year, the NCAA Division I board of directors approved recommendations that included allowing one quarter of teams in larger sports to compete in championship events; in that scenario, March Madness tourneys could expand to nearly 90 teams.\n\nThe NCAA is currently in the midst of an eight-year extension of its TV deal for the men's tournament worth $8.8 billion that runs through 2032. That would not be expected to change if a handful of teams are added.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMore games would provide a small boost through ticket sales and merchandise, but the pool of money the NCAA uses to pay out conferences and member schools would essentially stay the same. What could change, however, is how that money would be divided up if the tournament broadens.\n\nExpansion would also mean the men's tournament would have to find an additional site besides Dayton for its First Four games. The Ohio city already has games on Tuesday and Wednesday and wouldn't be able to host additional play-in games ahead of the tourney's traditional first-round opening on Thursday. Women's play-in games are at the same campus sites as the first two rounds of the tournament.\n\nExpansion is largely backed by larger conferences and smaller leagues do not want to lose the automatic bids that come with a conference tournament championship or face the prospect of always being slotted for the play-in games.\n\nThe earliest the NCAA Tournament could expand would be the 2025-26 season, the person told AP. The NCAA basketball oversight committee meets next week and the tournament selection committee has a meeting next month.\n\nThe men's tournament last expanded in 2011 when it went from 64 to 68 teams. The women's tournament matched that in 2022.\n\nThe women's tournament is coming off its most successful year ever that included a record audience of 18.7 million for the title game win by South Carolina over Iowa, the highest for a basketball broadcast of any kind in five years. It outdrew the men's championship game -- UConn winning its second consecutive title with a win over Purdue -- by nearly 3 million viewers. The women's tournament also had record attendance.\n\nAP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It expanded to 16 in 1951 before growing to 32 in 1975, and in 1985, March Madness achieved what is arguably basketball perfection when it adopted a field featuring 64 schools.\n\nThe status quo was slightly altered in 2001 when the NCAA introduced a single play-in game to determine the 16th seed in the Midwest Region, which ultimately led to the \"First Four\" being introduced a decade later.\n\nI'd argue the supplemental contests that were introduced in the 21st century are the textbook definition of a solution in search of a problem. Sure, they gave a few more teams a chance to punch their ticket to The Big Dance, and while some schools have been able to take advantage and make a deep run (VCU made it to the Final Four in 2011), they haven't really added that much intrigue.\n\nWhen you consider around $1 billion of the $1.3 billion the NCAA rakes in on an annual basis is generated by March Madness, it's easy to understand why it would want to milk that cash cow for everything it's worth.\n\nOver the past couple of years, there have been plenty of rumblings about expanding the size of the tournament even though most fans seem to be vocally opposed to the idea, and it would appear it's only a matter of time until those fears are realized.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Sports, the NCAA recently presented a couple of conferences with two plans that would involve expanding March Madness to either 72 or 76 teams and adding a second site to host the preliminary games. It's not entirely clear how the qualifying brackets would be structured, but it appears it would involve throwing more teams into the mix to firm up lower seeds.\n\nWhile it does feel like expansion is inevitable, I think it's fair to be a bit concerned about March Madness potentially suffering a death by 1,000 cuts. The addition of four or eight teams isn't as drastic as other rumored proposals concerning a field of 90 or even 128 schools, but it sure feels like the NCAA is slowly but surely working its way toward a higher number with the help of incremental tweaks.\n\nI'd love to be proven wrong in the long run, but I can't say I'm too optimistic.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_toole@brobible.com", "name": "Connor Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Four", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Four"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCU_Rams_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "VCU Rams men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/march-madness-logo-basketball.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666288", "eventUri": "eng-9666288", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The news was first reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nUnder the proposal, expansion of the 68-team field included both four- and eight-team models.

Last year, the NCAA Division I board of directors approved recommendations that included allowing one quarter of teams in larger sports to compete in championship events; in that scenario, March Madness tourneys could expand to nearly 90 teams.\n\nThe NCAA is currently in the midst of an eight-year extension of its TV deal for the men's tournament worth $8.8 billion that runs through 2032.

What could change, however, is how that money would be divided up if the tournament broadens.\n\nExpansion would also mean the men's tournament would have to find an additional site besides Dayton for its First Four games. The Ohio city already has games on Tuesday and Wednesday and wouldn't be able to host additional play-in games ahead of the tourney's traditional first-round opening on Thursday. Women's play-in games are at the same campus sites as the first two rounds of the tournament.\n\nExpansion is largely backed by larger conferences and smaller leagues do not want to lose the automatic bids that come with a conference tournament championship or face the prospect of always being slotted for the play-in games.\n\nThe earliest the NCAA Tournament could expand would be the 2025-26 season, the person told AP.

Labor market shortages hold back production and force businesses to raise wages to retain or hire staff, which stokes inflation.At Russia's answer to Davos, the St Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPEIF) Putin framed the labor shortages as due to alleged \"record low\" unemployment, rather than his full-scale invasion\u2014but migrant workers and keeping pensioners in work for longer could be the key to fixing this issue.\"The lack of labor limits economic growth,\" Putin said in the address posted on the Kremlin website. \"We are faced with not only a task, but also an opportunity to begin the massive attraction of qualified migrants from abroad.\"He said that would-be migrants would need to know Russian, as well as \"our traditions and culture, our laws, so that these people who come feel comfortable here, and, most importantly, do not create problems for local citizens.\"\"It is important to support the aspirations of people who have reached retirement age to continue working and be useful,\" Putin said, \"their knowledge, skills, and competencies are an important resource for the economy and society.\"In 2018, there were protests in Russia when the Kremlin announced a rise in the retirement age, for men from 60 to 65 and for women from 55 to 63. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Friday that Putin will probably use financial incentives to push pensioners to work beyond the retirement age to help ease Russia's labor shortages.The Washington, D.C. think tank also said that Putin's proposed migration policy shows how the Kremlin struggles to balance the need to address labor shortages with \"wide-scale anti-migrant sentiments in Russia, particularly as the Kremlin tries to further mobilize the Russian defense industrial base.\"Putin also called on the Russian government to enact policies like improving education and training, digitalizing Russian industry and increasing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to increase the labor supply and productivity.Newsweek has contacted the Kremlin for comment.", "summary": "The Russian president told the St Petersburg International Economic Forum how the country needed to increase its workforce.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/russia-putin-1910017", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2406297/russian-president-vladimir-putin.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:48:02", "author": "Brendan Cole", "authors": ["Brendan Cole"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.046}

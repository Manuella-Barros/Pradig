Police arrested seven people, including a 16-year-old boy. Narragansett police tried to break up the fighting at the Point Judith Terminal on Saturday night. Those arrested face charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. It was a scary scene for onlookers and other people who take the ferry. Around 30 people were involved in the brawl. We're told five adults were visiting from Brockton, Massachusetts, and the others involved were from Providence, Rhode Island. It's a reminder of a fight that broke out on the ferry ride back from Block Island nearly two years ago, when police were forced to board the ferry, leaping between moving boats to control the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. Just too much going on in this world already and we don\u2019t need fighting and feuding or what have you. You know?\" one visitor told NBC10 Boston. Two people were hurt in the fight, first responders say, and taken to the hospital. Their condition was unknown as of Monday afternoon.", "summary": "<p>Video reveals the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.necn.com/news/local/seven-people-arrested-after-massive-fight-on-block-island-ferry-dock/3260647/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.necn.com/news/local/seven-people-arrested-after-massive-fight-on-block-island-ferry-dock/3260647/\" target=\"_blank\">chaotic scene at the Block Island </a><a href=\"https://www.necn.com/news/local/seven-people-arrested-after-massive-fight-on-block-island-ferry-dock/3260647/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.necn.com/news/local/seven-people-arrested-after-massive-fight-on-block-island-ferry-dock/3260647/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">F</a><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.necn.com/news/local/seven-people-arrested-after-massive-fight-on-block-island-ferry-dock/3260647/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.necn.com/news/local/seven-people-arrested-after-massive-fight-on-block-island-ferry-dock/3260647/\" target=\"_blank\">erry dock</a> over the weekend, with a crowd of people throwing", "url": "https://www.necn.com/news/local/videos-shows-chaotic-scene-during-bawl-at-block-island-ferry/3261459/", "image": "https://media.necn.com/2024/06/7-people-arrested-after-massive-brawl-on-Block-Island-ferry-dock-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&fit=1920%2C1080", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:01:45", "author": "Darren Botelho", "authors": ["Darren Botelho"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": -0.243}

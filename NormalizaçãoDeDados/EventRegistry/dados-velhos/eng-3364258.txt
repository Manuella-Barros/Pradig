And Monday Night Raw, yesterday, showed what the main event of the this month's pay-per-view event WWE SummerSlam would look like. WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar was there, Braun Strowman was there, Samoa Joe was there and finally, there was Roman Reigns. And of course, absolute brutality was there.\n\nLesnar stepped into the ring along with Paul Heyman talking about SummerSlam and the alleged conspiracy by WWE and Raw General Manager Kurt Angle to take the title from the Beast. Walked in Samoa Joe and Braun Strowman talking about last episode's Last Man Standing match. And just in the two tried proving their power over either and in came Roman Reigns with his lethal spear striking down Samoa Joe. Sort of a revenge for last week's Coquina Clutch that had cost him the match against Strowman.\n\nAnd then, bang! Powerslam by the Monster on the Big Dog. Then it was just Strowman and Lesnar in the ring. It is the Beast looking eye-to-eye to the Monster. Guards were already kept outside the ring by Kurt Angle and they made their way in as fast as possible to separate out the two before could turn absolutely destructive. Soon, the entire Raw locker room emptied itself to stop the Lesnar and Strowman after the latter briefly cut through to make his way up to the champion to blow a few punches.\n\nBrock Lesnar is said to face a Fatal 4-way match against Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe at WWE SummerSlam, at Barclay Centre New York, on August 20.", "dateTime": "2017-08-15T17:44:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1500, "textStart": 1491, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8666666746139526, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "17:44:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "52726", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks", "score": 1}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 5}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 4}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 3}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 4}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 3}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 3}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 4}, {"id": "358615", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling holds"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_holds", "score": 2}, {"id": "374391", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman", "score": 3}, {"id": "378643", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam (2013)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam", "score": 3}, {"id": "383336", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling authority figures"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_authority_figures", "score": 3}, {"id": "498961", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kurt Angle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Angle", "score": 3}, {"id": "540007", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Powerslam"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerslam", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 4}], "image": "http://ste.india.com/sites/default/files/2017/08/15/616992-wwe-raw-grab-2.jpg", "timeCrawl": "17:44:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "WATCH: Brock Lesnar comes face-to-face with Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe a week ahead of WWE SummerSlam", "originalArticle": null}

The kickoff show will start two hours earlier at 5 p.m. ET and all action can be watched live nationally on WWE Network.\n\nBig fan of WWE? Be sure to subscribe to our podcast In This Corner with Brian Campbell where we break down everything you need to know each week.\n\n2017 WWE SummerSlam matches\n\nUniversal Championship -- Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman (Fatal 4-Way): There will be more than 1,200 pounds of mass in this match, which should be the main event of the card. Paul Heyman added a stipulation that Lesnar will leave WWE if he loses the title due to a Fatal 4-Way being unfair to the champion.\n\nWWE Championship -- Jinder Mahal (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura: It was long expected that Cena would be the one to fight and defeat Mahal, but Nakamura beat Cena clean to become the No. 1 contender for the WWE title. There has been no build otherwise for this match.\n\nUnited States Championship -- AJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens: The fourth time they will meet with the title on the line in a televised match, Styles and Owens will do so this time with SmackDown commissioner Shane McMahon serving as the special guest referee. This one should finally result in a ... somewhat-decisive finish.\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt: This feud finally came to a head Monday on Raw when Wyatt beat Balor clean and appeared to dump blood on him after the match. Backstage, Balor teased the return of the Demon King at SummerSlam.\n\nRaw Women's Championship -- Alexa Bliss (c) vs. Sasha Banks: Though Baley earned the No. 1 contendership, a shoulder injury has forced her from SummerSlam. Banks beat Nia Jax in a No. 1 contendership match on Monday.\n\nSmackDown Women's Championship -- Naomi (c) vs. Natalya: Earning her shot by winning a Fatal 5-Way match at Battleground, Natalya will look to win her first \"women's\" championship after previously being divas champion for two months. This match will likely take place on the kickoff show.\n\nRaw Tag Team Championship -- Sheamus & Cesaro (c) vs. Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins: Moments after Ambrose and Rollins reunited, general manager Kurt Angle locked in a tag team championship match for SummerSlam.\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin: Corbin attacked Nakamura and Cena came to the aid of the King of Strong Style on SmackDown by putting Corbin through the announce table. Daniel Bryan made the match official on Tuesday.\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev: Not exactly sure who came up with this one.\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass: Enzo Amore will be suspended above the ring in a shark cage. This should be on the kickoff show, one would hope.\n\nSmackDown Tag Team Championship -- The New Day (c) vs. The Usos (Kickoff Show): New Day won the titles at Battleground, so a rematch makes plenty of sense. There are no other tag teams on the show really deserving of the spotlight anyway.\n\nCruiserweight Championship -- Akira Tozawa (c) vs. Neville (Kickoff Show): After Tozawa surprisingly beat Neville clean for the title on Raw, the former champion gets his rematch at SummerSlam.\n\nJason Jordan & The Hardy Boyz vs. The Miz & The Miztourage (Kickoff Show): Good way to get six guys on the show who definitely needed to be featured. Also continues the Jordan-Miz feud for a future intercontinental title match.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T02:37:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 400, "textStart": 391, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8392156958580017, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373948", "time": "02:37:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "313955", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "score": 2}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

Since the inaugural SummerSlam in 1988, the event has been held in 13 different states, as well as in Canada and England. This is the third straight year that SummerSlam will take place again at Barclays Center in Brooklyn after Staples Center in Los Angeles hosted the event from 2009 to '14.\n\nEight different championships will be on the line, the most in SummerSlam history and one shy of the WWE pay-per-view record (nine at Vengeance: Night of Champions in 2007). The only title not currently scheduled to be defended: The Miz's Intercontinental Championship.\n\nLet's dive into some of the numbers behind the featured matches on this year's card.\n\nFatal 4-way match for the Universal Championship: Brock Lesnar (c) v. Roman Reigns v. Braun Strowman v. Samoa Joe\n\nWWE Championship: Jinder Mahal (c) v. Shinsuke Nakamura\n\n- The WWE Championship has been defended every year at SummerSlam since 1992. The title has changed hands eight times at SummerSlam, including five times in the past six years.\n\n- Despite first arriving in WWE in 2011, Mahal has never competed at SummerSlam. Mahal will become the third superstar in WWE history to defend the WWE Championship in his SummerSlam debut. Each of the previous two lost the match yet retained the title.\n\nUnited States Championship: AJ Styles (c) v. Kevin Owens\n\n- Shane McMahon will be the special guest referee for this match, and that could be bad news for Styles. This will be the sixth title match in SummerSlam history that features a special guest referee, and the champion lost in each of the previous five such matches.\n\n- The United States Championship has already changed hands seven times in 2017, the most in a single year since 2006 (also seven).\n\n- In his SummerSlam debut last year, Styles defeated John Cena in a critically acclaimed match. The bout was one of two matches that ESPN.com gave a perfect 5-point rating in its first year of WWE coverage (Pete Dunne vs. Tyler Bate at NXT TakeOver: Chicago).\n\n- Styles has lost each of his past three pay-per-view matches, tied for the longest losing streak of his career. Two of those losses came to Owens.\n\n- Owens looks to become the first four-time United States Champion since Cena won the title for the fourth time in 2015.\n\nRaw Tag Team Championship: Cesaro & Sheamus (c) v. Seth Rollins & Dean Ambrose\n\n- Tag team titles have changed hands six times at SummerSlam but only once in the past 15 years.\n\n- If Rollins and Ambrose win the tag team titles Sunday, Ambrose will become the eighth \"Grand Slam Champion\" in WWE history, meaning he will have won the WWE Championship, Intercontinental Championship, United States Championship and Tag Team Championship during his career.\n\n- Two years ago at SummerSlam, Rollins defeated Cena to become the first superstar in WWE history to simultaneously hold the WWE Championship and United States Championship.\n\n- Cesaro's first career WWE pay-per-view match occurred at SummerSlam in 2012 when he defeated Santino Marella for the United States Championship, and he remains the only superstar in WWE history to win the United States Title in his WWE pay-per-view debut. However, Cesaro has not won at SummerSlam since that title win (0-3).\n\n- Sheamus has won each of his past three SummerSlam matches, defeating Alberto Del Rio in 2012, Randy Orton in 2015 and Cesaro in 2016.\n\nJohn Cena v. Baron Corbin\n\n- This will be Cena's 14th career SummerSlam match, passing Triple H for second most all time (The Undertaker, 16). Cena has not missed a SummerSlam event since making his first appearance in 2004.\n\n- However, Cena is currently in the middle of a SummerSlam slump. He has lost at each of the past six SummerSlam events, including five WWE Championship matches. Cena's last SummerSlam victory came in 2010 when Cena and \"Team WWE\" defeated \"Team Nexus\" in a 7-on-7 elimination tag team match. Overall, Cena has lost nine times at SummerSlam, his most losses at any pay-per-view event.\n\n- Corbin is the only WWE superstar to win both a Money in the Bank ladder match and an Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal.\n\n- After going 6-1 at pay-per-view events in his debut year in 2016, Corbin is just 1-5 in 2017. The lone win: the Money in the Bank ladder match last month.\n\nFinn B\u00e1lor v. Bray Wyatt\n\n- In his WWE pay-per-view debut last year at SummerSlam, B\u00e1lor defeated Seth Rollins to become the inaugural Universal Champion. He remains the only superstar in WWE history to win a world title in his first career pay-per-view match.\n\n- Wyatt has not lost in singles competition at SummerSlam, defeating Kane in a Ring of Fire match in 2013 and besting Chris Jericho in 2014.\n\n- Wyatt once again finds himself outside the title picture. In the past five years, Wyatt has competed in 31 non-title pay-per-view matches, the most in the WWE during that span.\n\nRaw Women's Championship: Alexa Bliss (c) v. Sasha Banks\n\n- A women's championship has changed hands five times at SummerSlam but never in consecutive years. Last year at this event, Charlotte defeated Banks to win her second championship.\n\n- Bliss is the only woman to win both the Raw and SmackDown Women's Championships.\n\n- Banks is a three-time champion, but each of her title victories occurred on Monday Night Raw. Banks failed to walk out champion in each of her seven career pay-per-view title matches, including her victory by count-out over Bliss at Great Balls of Fire last month.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:34:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8352941274642944, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373948", "time": "04:34:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "228323", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "305867", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "score": 3}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

In the event that Lesnar loses, he will leave the WWE.\n\nJinder Mahal will guard the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. This is after Nakamura won a No. 1 Contenders coordinate against John Cena on SmackDown Live.\n\nRandy Orton and Rusev\n\nRandy Orton and Rusev haven't had the best summers on SmackDown Live. They were in various positions on the match card yet attempted to look aggressive.\n\nOrton matched Jinder Mahal for three months as they struggled for the WWE Championship. Mahal won the title at May's Backlash, which prompted two more pay-per-see matches. The Viper lost both and appeared to be erratic.\n\nRusev should return for Money in the Bank. Keep in mind his interest for a title coordinate at the June PPV? That never happened, and he didn't return until the principal seven day stretch of July, in the meantime as John Cena. One chaotic Flag Match later and the Bulgarian Brute looked lost.\n\nSo when WWE has two hotshots doing nothing, what do they do? They toss them into a match at SummerSlam with practically zero form and expectation they put on a decent match. It's conceivably an erratic before Orton and Rusev go in various ways, or the begin of a program for the fall.\n\nGiven the Apex Predator's misfortunes all through the late spring, search for him to bounce back with a major win. This doesn't help Rusev, who will go grounded into SmackDown Live. When it comes down to these two stars, be that as it may, it will be the greater name getting the win.\n\nBig Cass and Big Show\n\nFor the second time in 2017, WWE will break out the shark confine. To begin with, Chris Jericho was suspended in it at the Royal Rumble, while Kevin Owens and Roman Reigns combat for the WWE Universal Championship. This time it's Enzo Amore noticeable all around as Big Cass and Big Show fight at SummerSlam.\n\nThis quarrel began before Amore and Cass formally split up. The last man got envious of Show working with Enzo, which witnessed nothing at first. That switched when Cass beat up his previous closest companion and got stood up to by the World's Largest Athlete.\n\nConcerning Amore in the shark confine, it came at Cass' ask. It's uncommon to see a babyface get put in this circumstance while a foot rear area's thought gets put through. In the midst of all these \"warmth\" bits of gossip for the Realest Guy in the Room, be that as it may, does him being suspended in this confine have anything to do with them?\n\nWith respect to coordinate outcome, it's hard to see Cass on the losing end here. A misfortune would annihilate any force he made after the split from Amore and make everybody question if WWE has huge tentative arrangements for him. In view of that, search for the seven-footer to win.\n\nConcerning Enzo and Cass realigning, it's a captivating idea. It could be the heartless, heel mouthpiece for Cass to use since he was dependably the weaker of the two on the amplifier. Also, Amore isn't precisely \"quality\" in the ring. Be that as it may, if these \"warmth\" gossipy tidbits are valid, I can't see this occurrence to give him better situating.\n\nBaron Corbin and John Cena\n\nAll things considered, this current match's elements changed after SmackDown Live. It went from Baron Corbin nearly as a certification to lose because of his Money in the Bank folder case to a creating circumstance that is hard to peruse.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Corbin traded out his Money in the Bank folder case on Jinder Mahal as he confronted John Cena in the headliner. Doing this six days before SummerSlam appeared like an odd time for WWE to move this out, and the outcome made it much more head-scratching.\n\nWhile Cena diverted Corbin, Mahal moved him up and got the fruitful pinfall. This made the Lone Wolf only the third whiz to not trade out the Money in the Bank contract effectively (following Cena and Damien Sandow). It may not mean anything positive or negative toward his future, yet for SummerSlam, it leaves a fascinating circumstance.\n\nIn the event that Corbin held the folder case at SummerSlam, Cena would have likely gone over him, as it's the standard course WWE utilizes with geniuses that win the June stepping stool coordinate. They generally lose until the point when they win the world title on their trade out.\n\nWith Corbin no longer the folder case holder, it abandons him at an intersection. He'll confront Cena, who simply lost to Shinsuke Nakamura in a No. 1 Contenders coordinate. It's hard to see WWE give the Leader of the Cenation another misfortune, particularly to somebody that blew his trade out circumstance. That is just going to hurt the previous NXT star's future as an upper card player and abandon him purposeless for the fall.\n\nBray Wyatt and Finn Balor\n\nWhinny Wyatt versus Finn Balor should be a unique match at SummerSlam. It combined two of WWE's most secretive characters in the ring and gave fans a new matchup.\n\nAt that point came Monday's scene of Raw.\n\nWWE utilized the topic \"SummerSlam come right on time\" for the three-hour appear, with matches and points getting utilized six days ahead of time to make a \"SummerSlam-like\" air. While this gave its minutes, it removed a portion of the charm from Sunday.\n\nWWE did this with Balor versus Wyatt, choosing to put their match on six days early. The Eater of Worlds won in an alright match, poured \"blood\" on Balor and apparently set up additional to come. It removes a portion of the air from a moment go-around, yet fine.\n\nBalor at that point gave a meeting where he affirmed he got his rematch for SummerSlam. He at that point prodded the arrival of the Demon King, his option persona that hasn't been seen since SummerSlam 2016. All in all, what does WWE do? They formally reported the arrival of Balor's Demon King for Sunday, something never done in NXT or the principle program. Such a great amount for the suspicion or obscure interest of its arrival.\n\nThis everything except ensures a Balor win at SummerSlam, as he gets the high ground on Wyatt and prompts a third match, at whatever point that might be. More than likely, in any case, this match will lose all sense of direction in the rearrange of the dozen aggregate that will be seen, while the previous NXT Champion gets a win that won't do much for him.\n\nWWE Cruiserweight Championship Match\n\nNeville should protect the WWE Cruiserweight Championship at SummerSlam. At that point came \"SummerSlam come early,\" and Akira Tozawa got his title coordinate six days ahead of time.\n\nOn Raw, in an enjoyment forward and backward match, Tozawa pulled off the win to wind up noticeably the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. He finished Neville's half year rule that began at January's Royal Rumble pay-per-see. The King of the Cruiserweights was WWE's longest-tenured champion heading into Monday night.\n\nA Cruiserweight Championship rematch appears to be bound for the Kickoff Show, particularly with a twofold digit coordinate aggregate at SummerSlam. It can get 10-15 minutes in the opening two hours as opposed to being surged between two of the night's marquee matches.\n\nCrude was an extraordinary minute for Tozawa. On the off chance that anything, the Cruiserweight division's just great minutes have come through title wins. That went for TJP at the Cruiserweight Classic, Rich Swann's win on the presentation scene of 205 Live, and Neville winning his first primary list title in January.\n\nBe that as it may, in the same way as other before Tozawa, WWE has surprised babyface champions, and in a brief timeframe in 2017. Randy Orton's WWE Championship rule, Bayley's Raw Women's Championship rule, Cesaro and Sheamus' first Raw Tag Team Championship rule and AJ Styles' initially United States Championship rule all had unexpected endings. With the work Neville did at the best (and by an embarrassing margin) in the Cruiserweight division, it's hard to see him simply float out of the title picture.\n\nSo at SummerSlam, search for what WWE did with the United States Championship numerous circumstances in 2017 and have a title change days after the past one. Neville's appeal and devious foot rear area strategies were the best piece of the cruiserweights and should keep on shining, while Tozawa stays in the title picture however turns into the chaser -- once more.\n\nNaomi and Natalya\n\nThe SmackDown Women's Championship coordinate matching came as to some degree an astonishment. Naomi has held the title since WrestleMania 33 and been made to resemble a strong champion. In any case, her rival, Natalya, was the head-turner of this SummerSlam session.\n\nAt Battleground, the Queens of Hearts vanquished hotshots like Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch to end up plainly the No. 1 contender to the SmackDown Women's Championship at SummerSlam. Conflicting with the star control was a fascinating call, particularly for WWE's greatest gathering of the mid year. The \"Pizazz\" last name draws and Lynch set up herself from the minute she appeared on the principle list.\n\nThis appears like an instance of WWE pandering to SmackDown Live's \"Territory of Opportunity\" motto, which was utilized with Lana, Jinder Mahal and Breezango in the course of recent months. Saying this doesn't imply that it's a terrible thing that Natalya got the open door, however it's as yet a choice out of left field.\n\nIt doesn't appear like the opportune time for Naomi to drop the title. The Money in the Bank contract waits, which wouldn't bode well to capitalize on a foot sole area. With Baron Corbin neglecting to capitalize on SmackDown Live, it might mean Carmella holds her satchel for an additional period of two while Naomi keeps on sparkling (joke expected) with the belt. Additionally, there are more unique match alternatives with her than the niece of Bret Hart.\n\nThe New Day and The Usos\n\nThe SmackDown Tag Team Championship match is one of two scheduled for the SummerSlam Kickoff Show. It will see The New Day defend against The Usos, potentially in their last of three pay-per-view matches.\n\nAt Battleground, these teams arguably put on the best bout of the evening, one that also opened the show. New Day won, becoming the first tag team to hold the titles on both main roster shows since the brand split began in July 2016.\n\nWWE hasn't seemed concerned with flipping titles often, so it's possible a belt change is in the works here. It allows New Day to reach the history books (again), while The Usos continue another championship reign.\n\nHowever, look for Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods to reign supreme for the third consecutive SummerSlam. It's a show they thrived at in 2015 and 2016, the former of which began their record run as WWE/Raw Tag Team Champions. They shouldn't lose so quickly, as they can establish themselves with the Smackdown Tag Team Championships while another heel team gets an opportunity to defeat them at a future PPV.\n\nAlexa Bliss and Bayley\n\nAlexa Bliss was set to protect the Raw Women's Championship against Bayley at SummerSlam. One Nia Jax hurl to Bayley and an isolated shoulder later, the match got canceled and another contender was named.\n\nSasha Banks vanquished Jax to wind up plainly the new No. 1 contender, getting the open door she lost at Great Balls of Fire. It's a shot for her to get a fourth title rule, possibly prompting the longest of her vocation since the three she had in the late spring and fall of 2016 were sudden.\n\nWith the match change, it's hard to see the belt go from Bliss to Banks, however. Unless WWE was determined to doing this with or without Bayley, basically having an off the cuff coordinate prompt the Raw Women's Championship being held by another lady appears like WWE simply needing to flavor up SummerSlam. There's very little motivation to take the belt off Bliss, who has been beneficial as champion also.\n\nJoy and Banks had a great time coordinate at Great Balls of Fire and ought to convey something comparable at SummerSlam. Try not to search for a title change here unless WWE gets exhausted and needs to switch it up.\n\nCesaro, Sheamus and Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins\n\nThe Raw Tag Team Championships, belts that are once in a while held in high respect, apparently have the best story around them for SummerSlam. It has nothing to do with the champions, Cesaro and Sheamus, either.\n\nDignitary Ambrose and Seth Rollins will group at a WWE PPV interestingly since Payback 2014 when The Shield crushed Evolution. It was a high point for the previous stable, until the point when Rollins turned on Ambrose and Roman Reigns.\n\nRollins and Ambrose severed into a fight that went on for the majority of 2014 and revived it in 2015. They avoided each other for a modest bunch of months before their quarrels entwined after Great Balls of Fire. It prompted them reluctantly adjusting (it took until the Raw before SummerSlam) to battle off Cesaro and Sheamus, and get their title shot in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nThe Rollins-Ambrose story is fun and would make for an incredible minute in the event that they win at SummerSlam. There's too great of a story to tell in the event that they don't, however, as one of them can turn on the other and have a quarrel that conveys into the fall months. Imagine a scenario in which it's the Lunatic Fringe. Might he truly not confide in Rollins and choose to be vindictive? That appears to be more intriguing than them holding the Raw Tag Team Championships, something that still gives excitement esteem however as a less demanding way out for the WWE's imaginative procedure.\n\nBeside that, search for this to be the Match of the Night beside the headliner. In the event that given around 15 minutes (why wouldn't it be able to on a four-hour appear?), it ought to convey.\n\nThe Raw Tag Team Championships, belts that are once in a while held in high respect, apparently have the best story around them for SummerSlam. It has nothing to do with the champions, Cesaro and Sheamus, either.\n\nDignitary Ambrose and Seth Rollins will group at a WWE PPV interestingly since Payback 2014 when The Shield crushed Evolution.

In the event that given around 15 minutes (why wouldn't it be able to on a four-hour appear?), it ought to convey.\n\nAJ Styles and Kevin Owens\n\nAJ Styles and Kevin Owens will be the most recent rematch of SummerSlam. These unscrupulous off in matches since May, incorporating into Triple Threat sessions. So on Sunday night, it could be the finish of this long-standing fight.\n\nStyles and Owens exchanged the WWE United States Championship three times more than three months, including a change at the Madison Square Garden live occasion and a scene of SmackDown Live. It's kept the title dynamic, however with a plenitude of developments in the mid-card scene for the blue brand.\n\nThere is a wrinkle for this match at SummerSlam, as Shane McMahon will be the extraordinary visitor arbitrator. Given this is a McMahon and how extraordinary visitor ref circumstances generally work out, there will conceivably be shenanigans.\n\nIn the event that no title changes are occurring and if this is the finish of Styles-Owens, at that point is Shane's quality not significant? He could assume a part, regardless of whether it's by getting \"unintentionally hit\" and offering a move for five minutes or contending with KO. In case you're searching for a stunning foot rear area turn, it doesn't appear to be something WWE would do, especially given how prevalent Shane is.\n\nSummerSlam ought to be the finish of Owens versus Styles, so search for the last to win. Will they put on one of the night's best matches?\n\nJinder Mahal and Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nFor somebody who was on the low card of the WWE in April, it's the third month for Jinder Mahal's WWE Championship rule. He hasn't \"wowed\" with this PPV coordinates yet has seen his stock ascent through the mid year because of PPV headliner wins and crushing Randy Orton three times.\n\nShinsuke Nakamura will get his first primary list title opportunity in the WWE. He crushed John Cena to gain this shot on a scene of SmackDown Live, finishing the following phase of his climb up the list.\n\nNakamura versus Mahal is a new matchup that ought to be one of SummerSlam's last matches. It won't headliner, as that will be left to the stars of Raw and their name energy to close the show. Be that as it may, there's sufficient potential here for something energizing to occur.\n\nAn issue is timing. At WrestleMania 33, in spite of seven hours of programming, the WWE Championship coordinate got nine minutes and had a title change. It's difficult to believe that will occur at SummerSlam, yet with Mahal being a long way from the greatest name contending at the Barclays Center, it's conceivable he and Nakamura get cut for a considerable length of time, with the United States and Raw Tag Team Championship matches gobbling it up.\n\nWith Baron Corbin's Money in the Bank good and gone, it implies just Nakamura or Mahal can leave SummerSlam as champion. WWE has a voyage through India set for September, which would be perfect to have the Modern-Day Maharaja as champion. Is it enough to give Nakamura his initially singles misfortune, and at a PPV, however? It's an intense offer, yet one I think WWE will proceed with.\n\nFatal Four-Way WWE Universal Championship\n\nOne day, one week, one month, one year and after one decade, this will be the match that represents the moment of truth the 2017 SummerSlam PPV. It's with four of the best stars of Raw and the WWE, including the star control Brock Lesnar conveys to the table.\n\nThis resembled a standard Fatal Four-Way coordinate for the WWE Universal Championship until Paul Heyman reported that if Lesnar loses, he will leave the organization. That is in the midst of theory of him having another battle in the UFC.\n\nThis stipulation brings the authenticity angle that already worked with Lesnar and other best stars like John Cena. For this, it may not function also.\n\nAt the point when WWE re-marked Lesnar in March 2015, it was an agreement that started with WrestleMania 31 and was to end in three years. Why might WWE let him go before it terminates? They can get the most out of him for the following eight months until the point that he puts somebody over at WrestleMania 34 and takes off.\n\nWhile it's a decent endeavor at bringing a genuine circumstance into this match, it will at present be Lesnar successful. Nonetheless, search for this to be a Match of the Year competitor, with all the gifted hotshots required to make this an exhibition.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:13:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 10331, "textStart": 10322, "date": "2016-07-", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 19206, "textStart": 19196, "date": "2015-03-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8313725590705872, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373948", "time": "20:13:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 4}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

WWE Raw Video: Brock Lesnar gives glimpse of SummerSlamWWE Raw Results: Braun Strowman defeats Roman Reigns in Last Man Standing MatchWWE SmackDown Live: Shinsuke Nakamura beats John Cena, sets up SummerSlam clash against Jinder Mahal; watch video\n\nA week before Summerslam, which will feature WWE's biggest Superstars including John Cena, Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns and more, WWE Raw gave a preview what is in store next week. The highlight of the show The face-to-face-to-face-to-face encounter between Universal Champion Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe which didn't stay civil for long.\n\nHowever, the night began with, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins were brought back together after fighting it out. This was after Cesaro & Sheamus decided to attack their rivals leaving Raw General Manager Kurt Angle immediately sanctioned a Tag Team Title Match between the two duos at SummerSlam.\n\nLater on, Sasha Banks defeated Nia Jax to earn the opportunity to challenge Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss at SummerSlam. Also, Akira Tozawa defeated Neville to become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion.\n\nBut it was in the main event in the evening where chaos erupted between Universal Champion Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe, six nights before their monumental Fatal 4-Way Match at SummerSlam.\n\nLesnar's challengers surfaced one by one: first Samoa Joe, then Braun Strowman and finally Roman Reigns. The Big Dog quickly speared Joe in retaliation for The Samoan Submission Machine costing him his Last Man Standing Match against The Gift of Destruction the week prior, and Strowman disposed of Reigns with a Running Powerslam.\n\nThat left The Beast and The Monster Among Men alone in the ring, and while they made quick work of the legion of security Kurt Angle had hired to enclose the ring, the near-entirety of the Raw locker room barely managed to separate them, though Lesnar and Strowman briefly broke free to land a few wild punches. The rest will have to wait until Sunday and the titanic main event that could change Raw as we know it.\n\nRAW Results:\n\nBray Wyatt defeated Finn B\u00e1lor\n\nMickie James defeated Emma\n\nJason

An uncharacteristic mistake from Newcastle's high flyer allowed the Japanese challenger to hit his massive diving senton for the win and celebrate with his Titus Brand team mates Titus O'Neil and Apollo Crews. The rematch for the title with the former King of the Cruiserweights gunning for revenge will now take place on the Kickoff pre-show. While it initially seemed a little odd to have Tozawa capture the belt ahead of the second biggest show of the year, it made sense in hindsight, as he and Neville were given time to tell a story and give the title switch the attention it deserved. This encounter will likely be an entertaining but much quicker affair, which presumably will end with Neville falling short in his bid to regain the gold.\n\nPredicted winner: Akira Tozawa\n\nTag team match for the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship\n\nThe New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) (c) (with Kofi Kingston) vs. The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso)\n\nThe New Day defeated The Usos at Battleground to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship following a tremendous match, which undoubtedly stole the show. It was great to see the lesser light of the New Day, Xavier Woods, play such a pivotal role in guiding his friends Kofi Kingston and Big E to glory. The rivalry between two of the best tag teams in WWE of the last decade has lived up to all expectations and it's therefore something of a strange decision to see this rematch relegated to the Kickoff pre-show. Since the New Day clinched the titles the furious Usos have ambushed and assaulted them, demanding retribution. Hopefully they will still get enough time to add another great bout to the feud, but it would be surprising to see the belts change hands.\n\nPredicted winner: The New Day\n\nSix-man tag team match\n\nThe Hardy Boyz (Jeff and Matt Hardy) and Jason Jordan vs. The Miz and The Miztourage (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel) (with Maryse)\n\nThere has been no stranger WWE storyline in recent memory than the decision to have Raw General Manager Kurt Angle reveal that Jason Jordan is his illegitimate son after weeks of Raw commentator Corey Graves receiving secretive text messages about the former Olympic Gold Medallist's personal life. Fans have struggled to get on board with this classic piece of Vince McMahon inspired madness and predictably begun to boo Jordan, who is being presented as someone they should be cheering.\n\nJordan is of course a very talented wrestler, but quite whether this will benefit him in the long term remains to be seen. He has a chance here to record his first big win as he teams up with eternal fan favourites The Hardy Boyz against the devious Intercontinental Champion The Miz and his new lackeys, The Miztourage, aka Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel, in a six-man tag team match. Not even the calculating Maryse at ringside can surely win this one for her man.\n\nPredicted winners: The Hardy Boyz and Jason Jordan\n\nSingles match\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev\n\nRusev got more than he bargained for on the August 1 episode of SmackDown, when he issued a SummerSlam 'Open Challenge' which was answered by the 13-time world champion Randy Orton, who promptly hit him with an RKO. The Viper is coming off the back of an underwhelming run as WWE Champion, but is still one of the biggest stars in the company, who can always work a strong match. The outcome of this bout could say a lot about WWE's plans for both him and the Bulgarian Brute, who last month lost a hard fought flag match with his old foe John Cena, which truth be told, no one expected him to win. Presumably Orton won't be returning to the main event scene on Tuesday nights anytime soon, so why not push a younger, talented star who has the potential to be one of the top heels on the roster?\n\nPredicted winner: Rusev\n\nSingles match for the WWE SmackDown Women's Championship\n\nNaomi (c) vs. Natalya\n\nNatalya made her thoughts on Naomi adding LED lights to the SmackDown Women's Championship very clear when she criticised her for turning the title into a \"toy\". The Queen of Harts continued by claiming Naomi did not respect the Hart family and that she would bring honour to the title by claiming it from the fun-loving champ. She and Naomi have a lot of experience and could wage a cracking battle here. But the spectre in the background is of course Miss Money In The Bank herself, Carmella, who defeated Naomi on SmackDown recently with the help of the returning James Ellsworth, who so controversially helped her win the briefcase. With Baron Corbin having blown his Money In The Bank cash-in last Tuesday, could we see a successful rendition tomorrow night from the Princess of Staten Island? Don't be surprised if Naomi retains but a cunning Carmella takes advantage of a weakened opponent to walk out of SummerSlam with the belt.\n\nPredicted winner: Naomi\n\nSingles match\n\nBig Show (with Enzo Amore) vs. Big Cass\n\nBig Cass betraying Enzo Amore not once, but twice, before squashing him at Great Balls of Fire, was a sight to behold. Amore is a master of the microphone but still needs a lot of work to be portrayed as a viable in-ring threat. Cass meanwhile is 7ft tall and everyone knows, you can't teach that. He is improving step by step when it comes to promos and already looks the real deal due to his combination of size and power. Standing across the ring from him at the Barclays Center will be another giant, Big Show, but a snide attack by Cass assisted by Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in which they targeted his right hand has supposedly removed the most devastating move in Show's arsenal. his KO Punch. The wildcard in this match is Amore, who will be suspended above the ring in a shark cage. If he does get involved, perhaps Gallows and Anderson will again play a part. But looking towards the future, Cass has to be the one who comes out on top here.\n\nPredicted winner: Big Cass\n\nSingles match\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nMr Money In The Bank Baron Corbin riled John Cena when he launched a sneak attack on Shinsuke Nakamura after the 'Rockstar' defeated Cena to become number one contender to the WWE Championship. The 16-time world champion decided to come to Nakamura's aid and as a result hit Corbin with an AA through the announcers' table. A match was made between Corbin and Cena at SummerSlam, before Baron decided to intervene in a contest between the face of the company and the WWE Champion Jinder Mahal. He attacked Cena, then cashed-in his contract on a vulnerable Mahal, who has just received a super AA from Cena. But a distraction from John allowed Jinder to quickly roll-up Corbin and escape with his belt. On the one hand, it seems to have derailed all momentum that Corbin was building and made him look something of a fool. But if he brings a ferocious response to this clash and downs Cena at the second biggest pay-per-view of the year, that would be a huge step back in the right direction for the Lone Wolf.\n\nPredicted winner: Baron Corbin\n\nTag team match for the WWE Raw Tag Team Championship\n\nSheamus and Cesaro (c) vs. Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose\n\nOver the past year Sheamus and Cesaro have proved themselves to be the best tag team in all of WWE - an unlikely duo who were once bitter rivals but have become a well-oiled machine. The Europeans overcame the challenge of the Attitude Era legends The Hardy Boyz in an epic Iron Man match at Great Balls of Fire, but now face a pair of modern tag greats, the reunited Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins, aka two thirds of the dominant faction The Shield. Rollins of course betrayed Ambrose and the third man in that group, Roman Reigns, in the most despicable of fashion three years ago when he beat them down with a steel chair and joined forces with Triple H and The Authority.\n\nHaving enjoyed a long run as heel WWE Champion, then suffered and overcome serious knee injuries, he turned face and defeated his former mentor The Game at WrestleMania. But Ambrose wasn't going to forgive him quickly and WWE have teased a slow burning reunion, which was finally realised last week on Raw when they performed their signature fist bump. There is no doubt this will be a cracking match - these two teams are just too talented for that not to be the case. But how will it be resolved? Perhaps the most satisfying scenario would be Sheamus and Cesaro prevailing and Ambrose turning heel on Rollins - reigniting the career of the Lunatic Fringe.\n\nPredicted winners: Sheamus and Cesaro\n\nSingles match\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\nFinn Balor has never quite recovered the momentum he had when he became the inaugural WWE Universal Champion at SummerSlam last year by defeating Seth Rollins, thanks to the injury he suffered on the night he was crowned king of the mountain. After a long injury lay-off he returned to Raw and set about challenging Brock Lesnar and inserting himself in the main event picture. But he's been toiling away in a feud with the guitar-playing Elias and now finds himself embroiled in a contest with Bray Wyatt, who has been lumbering along since his abortive WWE Championship run ended at the hands of Randy Orton at WrestleMania and then in ignominy in the House of Horrors.\n\nBray did record a rare pay-per-view win, besting Seth Rollins at Great Balls of Fire, and seemingly coating Balor in blood on Raw was a new trick, but it's hard to see any outcome here other than Balor recording the win he needs to boost his standing ahead of another tilt at Raw's top prize. Especially when Wyatt has dared him to unleash his Demon King persona, which should at least ensure he has the most theatrical and impressive entrance of the evening.\n\nPredicted winner: Finn Balor\n\nSingles match for the WWE United States Championship\n\nAJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens\n\nThe United States Championship showdown is an obvious contender for the match of the night, even if AJ Styles and Kevin Owens's feud hasn't quite matched fans' lofty expectations so far. After losing the strap at a house shown in Madison Square Garden, Owens recaptured the belt from Styles in a bout that looked like it was building into a classic, but fell short, at Battleground. AJ then won it back again in a triple threat encounter also including Chris Jericho on SmackDown, when he actually pinned Y2J, not KO, to clinch the belt.\n\nWhen Owens lost his rematch despite the fact both of his shoulders were not on the mat, he blasted a referee and demanded another shot. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan agreed and made SmackDown commissioner Shane McMahon the special guest referee. Shane O'Mac has promised to call the match fairly. However, a subsequent brawl saw AJ accidentally kick Shane, and it's only a matter of months since he hurled him through a car window and beat the hell out of him at WrestleMania. Could we see Shane turn on AJ? It's a real possibility.\n\nPredicted winner: Kevin Owens\n\nSingles match for the WWE Raw Women's Championship\n\nAlexa Bliss (c) vs. Sasha Banks\n\nAlexa Bliss has managed to cling onto her Raw Women's Championship in all manner of ways - by destroying Bayley, dodging the challenge of Nia Jax and getting herself counted-out against Sasha Banks. With Bayley succumbing to a legitimate injury, she will not get a shot at redemption tomorrow night. Instead the duty falls to Banks, who very impressively forced Jax to submit to a Bank Statement on Raw this week. Banks is without doubt the top female competitor on Monday nights and she and Bliss could produce another very entertaining clash, as they did at Great Balls of Fire. However, if the plan originally was for Bayley rather than her to even be involved in this contest, then perhaps we shouldn't expect The Boss to regain the title she held on so many occasions last year.\n\nPredicted winner: Alexa Bliss\n\nSingles match for the WWE Championship\n\nJinder Mahal (c) (with The Singh Brothers) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nThe unlikeliest WWE Champion in history continues to prove the critics wrong heading into SummerSlam as Jinder Mahal prepares to face Shinsuke Nakamura. Having defeated Randy Orton some three times with the help of The Singh Brothers (including in a Punjabi Prison match where he also called on his mentor The Great Khali for assistance, in the most bizarre WWE return of 2017) who would bet against the Modern Day Maharajah withstanding the challenge of Nakamura?\n\nShinsuke hasn't quite connected with fans on the main roster like he did in NXT, perhaps due to a series of misfiring promos, which have done nothing but expose the one weakness the ring technician possesses when trying to engage fans in a second language. Defeating John Cena to become number one contender is certainly the way to assert your credentials, but this doesn't feel like the right time for the coronation of Nakamura as WWE Champion and would undo a lot of the hard work put in by WWE to try and establish Mahal as a genuine main event star.\n\nPredicted winner: Jinder Mahal\n\nFatal 4-Way match for the WWE Universal Championship\n\nBrock Lesnar (c)(with Paul Heyman) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman\n\nSome main events just have an extra special feel about them and this is certainly one of those contests. The four most dominant forces on Raw will collide in a battle of the behemoths when Universal Champion Brock Lesnar is challenged by WWE golden boy Roman Reigns, the monstrous Braun Strowman and dangerous wildcard Samoa Joe. Lesnar, who has again been teasing a return to UFC, has threatened to leave WWE if he loses this match because he is supposedly unhappy at having to defend his title against three opponents. Can the master of the F5 retain his prized title, or will he walk away from the company yet again?\n\nThere are so many interesting angles to this boutt, none more so than the brutal rivalry of Reigns and Strowman, which culminated in Roman attempting to end Braun once and for all at Great Balls of Fire by reversing an ambulance with him inside into a truck! Their feud has in many ways dominated WWE television in 2017. Then there is Joe, who was introduced as the hired gun of the now absent Triple H, who came close to beating Lesnar last month and has been presented as a genuine threat to the Beast Incarnate in a way few men - Goldberg aside - have been over the past few years. Having waited over a decade for a crack at the big time in WWE, Joe has seized the opportunity with both hands and it would be fantastic to see him emerge victorious here.\n\nLesnar is a huge fan favourite because he is a bona fide badass who lays waste to all before him, as we saw when he delivered a round of F5s to the Miz and the Miztourage a fortnight ago. But a situation where the Universal Champion is a part timer - however much excitement that generates when he does compete - cannot be ideal going forwards. A break for Lesnar as a result of him losing his belt but never actually being pinned or submitted might be the ideal solution and how great would it be if Joe was the one to capitalise?\n\nPredicted winner: Samoa Joe\n\nWatch WWE SummerSlam 2017 live on the WWE Network or on Sky Sports Box Office at midnight on Sunday, August 20.\n\nYou can follow all the action as it happens in the Mirror Sport SummerSlam 2017 Live Blog.\n\nWWE Live returns to the UK this November, tickets available at www.bookingsdirect.com.\n\nRead More WWE Mirror Exclusive interviews", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T22:58:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 4128, "textStart": 4120, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-01", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 16212, "textStart": 16203, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.800000011920929, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373948", "time": "22:58:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks", "score": 2}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 2}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 5}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

The pay-per-view is almost being treated like WrestleMania, considering it features 12 advertised matches and could last longer than five hours.\n\nThe kickoff show starts at 6 p.m. EDT, and the actual pay-per-view gets underway an hour later at 7 p.m. EDT at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Fans can either watch the SummerSlam with a live stream on the WWE Network, or they can order the PPV for $54.99. A subscription to the network costs $9.99 per month, though new subscribers get the first month free.\n\nIf the SummerSlam betting odds are any indication, the two world title matches shouldn't be very difficult to predict. Brock Lesnar is a significant favorite to successfully defend his WWE Universal Championship against Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe. Jinder Mahal has been the WWE Champion since he won the title at Backlash, but Shinsuke Nakamura has -500 odds to take the belt from him.\n\nThe most difficult match to call might be the Cruiserweight Championship Match. Akira Tozawa has even odds six days after beating Neville for the title. Neville had been the champion since Royal Rumble.\n\nJohn Cena is a -200 favorite against Baron Corbin, five days after he caused the Money in the Bank winner to fail during his cash-in attempt. Rusev is a -200 favorite against Randy Orton.\n\nFinn Balor is the biggest favorite at SummerSlam.

Nakamura interrupts Mahal's Independence Day celebrations\n\nThroughout Jinder Mahal's WWE Championship reign, we have seen exuberant celebrations and great patriotism from Mahal, attempting to bring Indian culture to so-called 'xenophobic' fans across the United States.\n\nTuesday was no different, as Mahal announced that it was Indian Independence Day, and it was time to celebrate that fact. Mahal and The Singh Brothers led the celebrations, which included dancers and even a woman signing the Indian national anthem, which was met with a chorus of boos in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nMahal's opponent at Summerslam, Shinsuke Nakamura, eventually arrived to interrupt the party, batting down Mahal's accusations of disrespect by stating that Tuesday was also an important day in his native Japan, as it was a day to pray for peace and remember those fallen in war - but Nakamura's appearance wasn't without a warning shot, as he pointed out that Sunday is an important day in America, as it will be the day that he takes the WWE Championship from Mahal.\n\n2. Natalya warms up for Summerslam by beating Becky Lynch\n\nHaving won the Fatal Five-Way at Battleground, Natalya will face Naomi for the Smackdown Women's Championship at Summerslam - and she took on Becky Lynch ahead of that meeting this Sunday.\n\nNaomi watched on from the commentary table as Natalya claimed the win, forcing Lynch to tap out to her Sharpshooter submission hold, though she was chased away from the ring by Naomi after locking in the Sharpshooter again after the bell had rung.\n\nAs Natalya attempted to make her exit, Carmella - the Money in the Bank contract holder - emerged alongside the newly-reinstated James Ellsworth, reminding both Naomi and Natalya that, whoever wins on Sunday, they will have to prepare for Carmella's cash-in, which may well come at Summerslam.\n\n3. Lana and Tamina vow to become unstoppable\n\nIn recent weeks, we have seen Lana and Tamina forge a surprise alliance in the women's division, though their relationship has been strained in recent weeks.\n\nThis week, Tamina complained that she hasn't had a title opportunity yet whereas Lana - a novice wrestler compared to Tamina - has already battled Naomi for the Smackdown Women's Championship.\n\nWhen Lana suggested that it's because nobody fears Tamina, many expected the Ravishing Russian to be obliterated by her ally.\n\nHowever, Lana claimed that she can help Tamina crush her competitors if she follows her instructions, which would eventually make her Champion - though it remains to be seen just what Lana has planned for Tamina moving forward.\n\n4. Randy Orton gives Rusev a taste of his own medicine\n\nAfter surprising Randy Orton at the end of last week's Smackdown with a Superkick out of nowhere, Rusev was back in action this week as he again took on Chad Gable, ahead of facing Orton at Summerslam.\n\nGable had sent Rusev to the outside with a belly-to-belly suplex, but when they roamed outside, Rusev threw Gable into the commentary table to ensure that both men were counted out in a draw before locking in the Accolade submission on Gable.\n\nHaving left Gable in a crumpled heap, Rusev returned to the ring to address the crowd, only to be hit with an RKO - yes, out of nowhere - from Orton, who had stormed the ring to give the Bulgarian Brute a taste of his own medicine.\n\n5. This time, it's Kevin Owens who accidentally attacks Shane McMahon\n\nWith Kevin Owens bidding to reclaim the United States Championship, he attempted to turn Champion AJ Styles and guest referee Shane McMahon against each - and it seemed to work when Styles accidentally hit McMahon with a Pele Kick after an altercation with Owens.\n\nStyles attempted to apologise to McMahon this week, and whilst Shane claimed there was no need to apologise, he did warn Styles that if he puts his hands on him at Summerslam, he will get just as physical with him in retaliation.\n\nOwens gleefully marched down to the ring to bask in frayed relations between Styles and McMahon, but after an attempted handshake with Styles sparked a shoving match, Owens hit McMahon square in the face with a Superkick.\n\nThat means that both men have now accidentally taken out the guest referee ahead of their match on Sunday, adding real intrigue to how McMahon will call the match.\n\n6. The Usos defeat The New Day ahead of Summerslam bout\n\nHaving lost their Smackdown Tag Team Championships at Battleground in an excellent match, The Usos will face off against The New Day at Summerslam in a bid to win back their titles from Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods.\n\nThe two teams have gone back and forth in recent weeks, and The Usos now have momentum heading into Sunday's match having picked up a win over Kofi and Xavier - now they just have to do it again in Brooklyn on Sunday to reclaim the Smackdown Tag Team Championships once again.\n\n7. Baron Corbin loses after cashing in his Money in the Bank contract\n\nAfter opening the show, Jinder Mahal also closed the show by taking on John Cena, and he even had The Singh Brothers helping him yet again before referee Mike Chioda banished both men from ringside.\n\nThat left Mahal one on one with Cena, and Cena appeared to be in position for the win after hitting a huge Avalance Attitude Adjustment from the second rope, his opponent at Summerslam - Baron Corbin - ran in to break up his pin attempt and leave the match as a no-contest.\n\nAfter hitting Cena with his Money in the Bank briefcase, Corbin turned back from the ramp to the ring and cashed in his contract, but that proved to be a huge mistake.\n\nUpon hearing the bell for his match with Mahal, Corbin turned to knock Cena off the apron, giving Mahal the perfect opportunity to swoop in and roll up Corbin for the three count, retaining his WWE Championship and leaving Corbin to rue his missed opportunity - but he will have the chance to take his frustration out on Cena at Summerslam.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T04:14:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "04:14:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "113", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "223175", "label": {"eng": "Providence"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Providence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks", "score": 3}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 5}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

That possibility hangs like a giant axe over this match. But the energy and excitement for this Universal championship match didn't begin just a few weeks ago. No, the path to this Fatal 4-Way is a long, intertwined patchwork involving all four participants, with significant history dating back to early 2015. There's animosity going in every single direction between these four behemoths in the ring, but the central conflict in the middle of it all is Reigns vs. Lesnar, and the unfinished business they have with one another.\n\nLet's take it back to January 2015 when Reigns won the Royal Rumble and got booed out of Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center despite The Rock raising his arm at the close of the show. The build-up to the WrestleMania 31 match between Reigns and then-WWE champion Lesnar was, at best, polarizing and controversial. A lot of fans in Santa Clara seemed poised to boo Reigns out of Levi's Stadium too, until Seth Rollins did the unthinkable and cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase mid-main event, stealing the title away.\n\nBoth Lesnar and Reigns were in a triple-threat WWE championship No. 1 contenders match in 2016 featuring Dean Ambrose (won by Reigns) and both men were in the last two Royal Rumbles, but there hasn't been a clash of this magnitude since their spoiled match at WrestleMania 31. Rumors abound of a future one-on-one match, but for the time being, this Fatal 4-Way offers far more permutations.\n\nReigns has history with the other two participants in this match as well. In Samoa Joe's first match on the main roster, Joe beat Reigns on Monday Night Raw in February -- and Joe got the better of Reigns twice more in June; Joe won a Fatal 5-Way at Extreme Rules that earned him a shot at Lesnar and the Universal title at Great Balls of Fire, and then beat Reigns again two weeks later on Raw. Their Universal title No. 1 contender's match in mid-July ended in a no contest after Braun Strowman returned, which was the main catalyst for this four-way.\n\nThe brightest and most intense animosity hangs between Strowman and Reigns, who have had several of the most intense WWE matches of the year thus far. They faced off as far back as October 2015, when Reigns was the first to defeat Strowman (via countout) in the midst of the Wyatt Family vs. The Shield rivalry, but this rivalry was truly ignited at Fastlane this past March.\n\nReigns gave Strowman his first pinfall loss in the WWE, and Strowman hasn't stopped chasing him ever since. Strowman pushed Reigns off a loading dock while he was strapped to a stretcher and tipped over the ambulance he was put inside. Reigns backed an ambulance up at high speed into a trailer a few months later. And still, Strowman wasn't finished with Reigns quite yet.\n\nBetween the history and animosity among all those combinations, there's more than enough heat to go around. Add in the unknown of Lesnar vs. Strowman and Joe vs. Strowman, and there's a lot to work with here. Without having to rely simply on himself to get through this match, this main event can carry on far longer than your average Lesnar match as well, if need be.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Lesnar walks out without the title and walks out of WWE again, but if the last couple of years have taught us anything, it's that the WWE isn't afraid to take a big chance. One year after the Barclays Center crowd inexplicably and loudly booed the design and color of the new Universal championship, taking away from a big moment for Rollins and Finn Balor, this match will be a far more popular spectacle.\n\nNo words necessary. Just a SPEAR from @WWERomanReigns! #RAW #SummerSlam pic.twitter.com/qCEdQEcU09\n\n- WWE (@WWE) August 15, 2017\n\n\"That's going to be a pretty interesting situation. I can't recall a time where you had four guys all sort of having this monster build, all in the same way.\"\n\n\"Brock Lesnar is Brock Lensar. You don't need to say more than that.\"\n\n\"Roman Reigns, whether people love him or hate him ... he's the guy.\"\n\n\"Samoa Joe, since he's come to WWE, has just become this unstoppable force with his match with Lesnar, and taking Lesnar as far as he did, and what he's done with Roman and Braun.\"\n\n\"Then there's Braun Strowman who has very quickly become this, he calls himself the monster among men, and it's hard to argue that he isn't when you talk about a guy with that size and that level of strength, but that when you see him run across the ring and the speed at which he does it, his ability to throw guys around, I hate to say it because it's a different style, but it's almost Lesnar-eqsque, seeing a guy that big... trust me, when you're in a ring with a guy and he's that size, he's not supposed to be able to move that fast. And that's the way you feel like when you're in the ring with Lesnar.\"\n\n\"Add into that the Jon Jones challenge and everything else, Lesnar doesn't have to get beat here. If he just doesn't win, that's all that matters. It's a really cool dynamic that you don't know what is going to happen.\"\n\n\"You have four guys in there, all over the 260 mark, everybody in there is agile, and can move, and is fast. These are athletes. These aren't plodding guys lumbering around the ring. This is speed and quickness. They move like cruiserweights, but they're not. It's a whole new world, in that manner.\"\n\nAfter a lengthy absence post-WrestleMania, Lesnar and Heyman have settled right back into the pocket over the last month or so. Getting into the ring with guys his own size gives Lesnar a lot more to work with, and with three of them in play, expect to see some vintage Lesnar (sorry Michael Cole).\n\nAs much as the talk about a Lesnar-Jon Jones UFC superfight has grown legs, and seems especially likely in a world where Mayweather-McGregor is a reality, Lesnar still has several months of his previous USADA suspension to serve out before he can even think of stepping back into the octagon. That fight will happen, but emerging from this match with a new rival (or an old one) and starting his path to the WrestleMania 34 main event seems the likeliest scenario in this match.\n\nStrowman seems like the least likely to emerge from this match as Universal champion, if for the simple fact that he doesn't really need a world title right now. A strong showing in this match would be a perfectly acceptable outcome, and if it sets the stage for a future one-on-one match with Lesnar some time between now and WrestleMania, all the better.\n\nIf, somehow, he emerges victorious here, it's hard to imagine a scenario where anyone outside of this quartet (most likely Reigns) could take that title off of him. Strowman's grown by leaps and bounds over the last year, and he can go with any of the top guys on Raw right now. It simply feels like he needs to get a few more big matches under his belt (and this one could go a long way) before he becomes the top guy on Raw.\n\nThe Brooklyn crowd, at its very best, can be described as impatient over the last few years. A Reigns victory would likely end with a showering of boos and a lot of the same old arguments being made against \"the big dog\". While I, for one, have heard the words \"dog\" and \"yard\" enough for two lifetimes, the Reigns hate overall has grown tired. As long as there's a creative end-game in play, with Lesnar perhaps coming back at Royal Rumble or WrestleMania, there's no reason Reigns can't leave this match as the winner.\n\nThe conflict with Strowman still seems to have a little bit of fire underneath it, and with Strowman and Joe sticking around to chase him in Lesnar's absence, there are plenty of ways things could play out in the last few months of 2017 with Reigns on top.\n\nAfter a bit of bad luck and some uncertainty at the very beginning of his main roster run, Samoa Joe has turned it up to 11 in his chase of Lesnar and the Universal championship. He pushed the champ hard at Great Balls of Fire, and everything leading up to and after that event screams of Joe being a long-time fixture in the main event.\n\nA win for Joe would come as something of a shock on Sunday, but there's no doubt he's done everything right to get himself to the spot he's in right now. If something screwy happens, like a Paul Heyman double-cross that I'm not sure WWE's in a position to pull off at this moment, Joe could do a lot of good carrying the title into the fall.\n\nBoth Strowman and Samoa Joe will be competing at their first SummerSlam. Only two superstars in WWE history have won a world title in their SummerSlam debut. Lesnar defeated The Rock for the WWE Championship in 2002, and Balor defeated Rollins to become the inaugural Universal champion in 2016.

He decimated John Cena in 2014 when he made him look like a rag doll via German suplexes and became champion in one of the most lopsided victories in recent history.\n\nIf you see Brock Lesnar at SummerSlam this year, you might not see that. In fact, you might just see him leave.\n\nThat's because if Lesnar loses the Fatal Four Way main event and the Universal Championship, he will leave WWE. And some signs point to that actually happening instead of just being a story line bluff. Minutes after defeating Daniel Cormier at UFC 214, Jon Jones got a mic and turned his attention to Lesnar, who was last seen in the UFC in 2016.:\n\n\"Brock Lesnar, if you wanna know what it feels like to get your ass kicked by a guy who weighs 40 pounds less than you, meet me in the octagon.\"\n\nTwo days later, WWE capitalized on that hype. Paul Heyman went out to paint the champ as the ultimate underdog, one whose challenges may be so difficult that he doesn't actually overcome them. He blamed it on the odds of winning the Fatal Four Way title match. With Roman Reigns, Samoa Joe, and Braun Strowman making up three quarters of the large adult wrestling sons match, defeating them seems like a lofty goal from the start.\n\nHeyman expanded a bit more and blamed the match's existence on who Kurt Angle answers to, implying that its less of a story motive and one commanded by WWE's real-life bosses. \"Why don't we just rename this SummerSlam 2017: Brock Loses the Universal Title. Because sir, respectfully, you've been told to make Brock Lesnar pay the ultimate price haven't you?\" If the nod to UFC wasn't enough Heyman spelled out what fighting fans wanted to hear. If Brock loses the Universal Title at SummerSlam, he leaves WWE.\n\nJust a week before, reports came out that Lesnar would not sign an extension with WWE, so this makes perfect sense. Would Lesnar leave WWE early to un-retire from the UFC? Not necessarily, although this is may be the best way to inject a sense of doubt in spite of Brock's victorious performances at SummerSlams past.\n\nTaking a look at his opponents, one would have to wonder if Lesnar could legitimately lose. The competition has never been more prepared to topple Brock.\n\nLesnar and Roman Reigns faced off in the main event of WrestleMania 31. Both competitors were spent as the match wound down, giving Seth Rollins his chance to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase and snatch the WWE Championship from Brock. Had the one-on-one match continued, Reigns could have beaten Lesnar -- that's not something many Lesnar opponents get to even entertain.\n\nMost recently, Samoa Joe got his chance at the Universal strap. Joe got the best of him with enough sleeper holds to make Lesnar look like the ripest tomato in the garden. But thanks to a quick escape via F5, Lesnar was able to scratch out the win. The moral victory that Joe got from having an entertaining match with Lesnar despite losing may have been worth more than the actual match's victory. Joe should have beaten Lesnar, but it was last gasp vs. last gasp, and Brock's won out.\n\nThen you have Braun Strowman, the comparative novice in the match, who removes a certain characteristic from most Lesnar matches -- the size advantage. Lesnar must look up at his opponent and cower (well, the Lesnar eqvivalent of cowering) at the sight of WWE's monster among men. Their singular confrontation was teased, however, during last Monday's edition of RAW. Surrounded by rows of security guards (and after Roman and Joe were taken out) Lesnar and Strowman had an intense staredown that escalated into a fight, much to the chagrin of the men with their tucked in black tees and then the entire WWE locker room.\n\nLooking back, you could see this as a pivotal moment within the super heavyweight portion of the WWE roster. Strowman winning at SummerSlam could be a changing of the guard, officially certifying him as WWE's top beast.\n\nUnlike most of his other SummerSlam appearances, Brock doesn't have to be pinned to lose in this multi-man match -- that's how he ended up dropping the title to Rollins back at Mania 31, as Seth pinned Roman instead of Lesnar. Brock Lesnar's beast incarnate persona would not suffer as a result, which would come in handy upon Lesnar's next quarterly set of appearances. With WWE on hold, he could take that time for a UFC fight.\n\nWith a wrestler as dominant as Brock Lesnar in the venue he's most dominant in, it's hard to convince fans he has a legitimate chance of losing. But thanks to his large competition, and the possibility of fighting in the octagon again, WWE has done just that.\n\nStill, it's feasible to see Lesnar win at SummerSlam and fight in the UFC: He did it just last year. Something about this time feels just different enough, though.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T15:21:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "15:21:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 2}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 5}, {"id": "309979", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "328692", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of WWE personnel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_personnel", "score": 2}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 4}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 4}, {"id": "336108", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "score": 3}, {"id": "336947", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Daniel Cormier"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cormier", "score": 3}, {"id": "339509", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pin (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 2}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 4}, {"id": "340569", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Seth Rollins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rollins", "score": 2}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 5}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 2}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 4}, {"id": "358615", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling holds"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_holds", "score": 2}, {"id": "362662", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Suplex"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex", "score": 3}, {"id": "374391", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman", "score": 3}, {"id": "382893", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Octagon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octagon", "score": 3}, {"id": "498961", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kurt Angle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Angle", "score": 3}, {"id": "684004", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Money in the Bank ladder match"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_ladder_match", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-dnoTRRnM3HLA8qdm7PMHnrAQew=/0x0:1200x675/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56237233/lesnar.0.jpg", "timeCrawl": "15:37:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Brock Lesnar is somehow an underdog at SummerSlam", "originalArticle": null}

Lesnar wouldn't have to be involved in the decisive end to the match to lose the championship - so a lengthy absence following that kind of 'loss' seems the perfect way to keep his monstrous reputation in tact while he takes off for a while.\n\nIf that does indeed prove to be the case - and it's far from certain - the matter then becomes a question of just who WWE decides to crown as a new champion for now. Lesnar and Reigns are still rumoured to be on course for a WrestleMania event next year so the prospect of Joe or Strowman taking the title seems more likely.\n\nOne thing's for sure, Sunday's match probably won't be a long one. This foursome have produced some great television over the last few weeks by essentially just battering one another - as four big, powerful athletes it works well enough.\n\nRead more Why you should not miss WWE NXT Takeover Brooklyn III\n\nAnother highlight for Raw's portion of SummerSlam is the reuniting, albeit a little tenuously, of former Shield teammates Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose. A partnership between the two has been heavily teased in recent weeks and this week's episode of Raw saw it confirmed that they will in fact pair up to take on the Raw tag team champions in Cesaro and Sheamus. It seems inevitable that, sooner or later, the combustible pairing of Rollins and Ambrose will become unlikely champions - is SummerSlam a little too soon?\n\nA year after winning the Universal championship on a bittersweet night at SummerSlam 2016, Finn Balor is set to go head to head with Bray Wyatt in Brooklyn this weekend. Balor won the gold twelve months ago but was forced to vacate it immediately after a legitimate injury sustained in the process kept him on the shelf for the better part of the next nine months. The programme with Wyatt has probably been Balor's best since his return and, to further whet the appetite, it was even confirmed on Raw this week that his hugely popular demon persona will make its return at the weekend. It's an entrance usually worth paying for on its own.\n\nFinn Balor will return in his Demon persona to try and get the better of Bray Wyatt (WWE)\n\nBig Cass has gone it alone in WWE after distancing himself from former partner Enzo. At SummerSlam he faces Big Show in a match that sees Enzo suspended above the ring in a shark cage. This probably needs to be where WWE draws a line under Enzo and Cass on screen. If Cass is to make it big then he'll need to truly move on to something new, while Enzo's energy and popularity will see him do well enough in whatever follows for him. As for SummerSlam - it's only right that Cass is left standing tall at the end but it won't be plain sailing against the veteran giant.\n\nThe Raw women's championship is also on the line at SummerSlam. A win for Sasha Banks against Nia Jaxx this week puts her in the spotlight on Sunday as she goes up against Alexa Bliss. An unfortunate injury to previous challenger Bayley has unwittingly set us up for the possibility of a fascinating story here; could Banks go on to claim the gold having stepped in at the expense of her good friend? If so, it'd be a great opportunity for a bitter Bayley to come back and claim a measure of revenge - quite whether WWE is prepared to do that given the her huge popularity with the younger members of their fan base remains to be seen. Either way, it sets things up nicely for SummerSlam.\n\nAlexa Bliss defends her Raw Women's Championship against Sasha Banks (WWE)\n\nThat's not the final Raw title being defended at the weekend. Akira Tozawa sprang a huge surprise in winning the Cruiserweight championship on this week's episode of Raw. The scheduled match with previous champ Neville at SummerSlam still goes ahead with the roles of champ and challenger now reversed - after losing the gold following a record reign of almost 200 days, Brit Neville will be hungry for revenge as he bids for an immediate return to championship glory.\n\nSummerSlam is recognised as second only to WrestleMania in terms of WWE events during the year - there's no surprise that this stacked card has that marquee-event feel to it. Raw has done its bit to get us ready - it's now over to Smackdown Live to see what they have in store...\n\nWWE Summerslam is live this Sunday as a four-hour special from Brooklyn, New York.

Here's why he should win the main event.\n\nIn what is turning into one of the most interesting installments of WWE SummerSlam in years, this Sunday's main event is a battle of the monsters. Brock Lesnar will defend his Universal Championship in the main event against Samoa Joe, Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman.\n\nPaul Heyman has already been on the record saying that he and his client are walking should he not leave with the title this Sunday. With four men in the ring, Lesnar doesn't have to factor into the decision to lose his belt.\n\nThere is a very strong possibility that someone else could be leaving Brooklyn as the champion. After an impressive showing against Brock Lesnar at WWE Great Balls of Fire, Samoa Joe could very well end up winning the championship. Here's five reasons to make the case he should be champion.\n\nAt 38 years old, Samoa Joe is still on top of his game in the ring. His work in the ring is great just as it always has been and his matches thus far in the company have been highly talked about from NXT to the main roster.\n\nSince he's entered into the main event scene, Joe has brought the physicality and intensity to a scene that has absolutely needed it. The RAW brand's main event scene was suffering a bit with a part-time champion and it has seemingly elevated itself thanks to Joe.\n\nAs Universal Champion, Joe would be the standard bearer and certainly would create an example for all aspiring champions.

The current plan is to have Brock Lesnar defend his Universal Championship against Braun Strawman. This battle of titans would take place September 24th at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\nEven further, WWE Hall of Famer, Jim Ross also believes this is the direction WWE is heading. He had this to say on his blog:\n\n\"Also, I am not of the mindset that it is automatic that Brock Lesnar will lose the Universal Title on Sunday. I could see, however, this huge main event setting up Brock Lesnar vs. Braun Strowman down the road on another big stage.\"\n\nThis marks the second leak this week concerning SummerSlam's main event. WWE was said to be doing their best to keep the finish of SummerSlam's Fatal 4-Way under wraps. So much so that the actual competitors were to be kept in the dark until the last minute.\n\nWell, seeing that they're renting out the arena for four consecutive days, WWE may have been contractually obligated to let the folks at Barclays in on privileged information. And now, WWE can officially regret divulging information to the loose lipped Barclays. In order to promote the RAW after SummerSlam, Barclays tweeted the following (SPOILER):\n\nKeeping the stipulation at play for SummerSlam in mind, (Brock Lesnar leaves WWE if he loses the Universal Championship) this means that Brock Lesnar will be retaining on Sunday. If Brock loses he'd be back home cuddling Sable on Monday, not appearing on RAW.\n\nBarclays has since deleted the tweet which only magnifies their flub.\n\nSunday's Fatal 4-Way is set to be one of the most dramatic matches in WWE memory. With such a competitive field, WWE could theoretically place the Universal Championship on Roman Reigns, Samoa Joe, and Braun Strowman with no issues. However, it looks like it will be the Beast Incarnate who leaves SummerSlam as Universal Champion.\n\nWe can't expect WWE to audible off of Lesnar winning on Sunday just because of a negligent tweet. There is the chance that Barclays has no idea what they're talking about, but the fact they deleted the tweet is incriminating, to say the least. But, anything can happen in WWE so maybe there's still a plan that can re-insert surprise back into the match.\n\nIf we are moving to Lesnar/Strowman look for something within the Fatal 4-way to spark that fueled. And definitely, do not expect Strowman to be pinned. Spoiler or not, Sunday will be exciting.\n\nby Jack Snodgrass | August 18, 2017", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T20:16:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 403, "textStart": 389, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-24", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 2668, "textStart": 2653, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "20:16:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "228323", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 2}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 5}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 4}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 5}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 2}, {"id": "360365", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Staples Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staples_Center", "score": 3}, {"id": "499688", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jim Ross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ross", "score": 3}, {"id": "556815", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Fatal 4-Way"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Fatal_4-Way", "score": 3}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}], "image": "http://media.popculture.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-18-at-4-19-55-pm-20010092-640x320.png", "timeCrawl": "06:34:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Possible Spoiler for WWE's Plans After SummerSlam", "originalArticle": null}

It's this type of booking that can only be described as \"backwards\" which is also destructive, doesn't make any sense and does little-to-nothing for anyone involved. More importantly, it hurts the very delicate WWE championship reign of Jinder Mahal.\n\nI wrote about Jinder Mahal's title run (here) a couple of weeks ago. Instead of putting a fresh foot forward with their surprise World champion; they've sent him out on TV to cut the same promos and same match finishes with the same opponent month after month. From all reports he has had good matches and has had heat from the live crowds at house shows. So there's clearly just a problem when it comes to TV, it's the same over and over again. I don't even know who to blame for this either. The blame has to go somewhere and I refuse to put it on Mahal.\n\nIn the WWE, there's four guys who seem to have long-term booking plans. You can figure out who they are, just turn on Monday night RAW, all the answers are there. When it comes to the rest of the roster, \"close your eyes and throw the dart\" seems to be the booking technique. There seems to be no planning outside of the current month they're in. We are a week away from the second biggest show of the year and the WWE champion got his opponent nineteen days before the show. Not to mention how we got there, they put two guys against each other on a Tuesday and the winner is in. The booking isn't only backwards, it's tired.\n\nWhere's the build? Where's Shinsuke Nakamura's rise to the title shot? He was just working Baron Corbin in quite possibly the worst matches of his career. Coming off the heels of the unbelievably uneventful program with Corbin, he's thrown in a match with John Cena for a SummerSlam title shot. There's no build, doesn't spike the rating at all, and with the exception of the last minute, wasn't great. There needs to be build to raise ratings, to get people invested to tune in. People tuned in to see the horrible payoff of the Kurt Angle storyline because it was built up over several weeks. The way they booked Nakamura into this match with Mahal is another example of how they've screwed up Mahal's title run.\n\nThis past Tuesday, we had the pleasure of getting the Randy Orton vs Jinder Mahal \"Grudge match\". The title wasn't on the line, and they made the point to beat the \"Singh brothers are not here\" (THEY WERE THERE!) into our heads. It had disaster for Mahal written all over it. You could see it coming from a mile away. In the middle of the ring, in their best match yet, Orton beat Mahal. The WWE champion loses on TV. In what world does this seem like a good idea? I watched this match (hours after it aired) with a couple of longtime wrestling fans who couldn't believe it either. I ranted on Twitter (tweet me) and some of the responses I got proved that the WWE backwards booking had poisoned the fans.\n\n@RealCJLive: Yes because losing once out of the 4 times he's faced Orton is a joke. Get over it.\n\nWell, him beating Orton three times has done NOTHING, so losing to him in the \"Grudge match\" certainly will do NOTHING for the CHAMPION.\n\n@JayAlletto: The entire point was to close the door definitively on that feud & launch Orton vs Rusev.\n\nNo. First of all, Orton and Mahal have both moved on already. Mahal has a new opponent at SummerSlam (they've had NO interaction), as does Orton. The Mahal/Orton match wasn't done to launch the Rusev feud, Rusev kicking him as the show went off the air was. Which could've been done a million and one other ways. The champ didn't need to lose on TV for that kick to happen.\n\n@RealCJLive: I've never seen someone this mad over one loss lol\n\nThen you must not pay attention to wrestling fans on Reddit or Twitter. The WWE champion, no matter who it is, should NOT lose on TV in a singles match unless he's dropping the belt! I don't even think he should get pinned in a tag match but that's a lot better than a singles match. So this was more of the straw that broke the camel's back as it pertains to this Mahal title run. The guy can't even win on TV when his help isn't there. Ugh.\n\nThen I got a tweet from @mkurtz91 that gave me hope: I'm with you Brian. Building a credible champion whether they are heel or face is vital. Credibility makes for more money matches.\n\nDid Randy Orton, a thirteen time WWE champion, need to beat Jinder Mahal? Absolutely not. Does beating Jinder Mahal do anything for Orton moving forward? Absolutely not. Shouldn't these questions be asked before you make the decision to have your champion lose on TV? Absolutely yes. Wouldn't Orton beating Mahal technically make him the number one contender now? Yes, yes it would. It's just illogical that the guy who didn't win the title, didn't win the feud, gets the last win of the program. WHAT? If Orton absolutely, no way around it needed to pin Mahal in this program (which he didn't), he should've done it before Mahal became champion. It's backwards booking and it's become the WWE way, the way it shouldn't be.

The 38-year-old finally made his main roster debut in January, and less than seven months later, he is gearing up to headline one of the organization's biggest events of the year. Joe, along with Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman, will challenge WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar for the title in an anticipated fatal four-way at SummerSlam, which goes down at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Sunday, and streams live on the WWE Network.\n\nIt's a dream opportunity for an athlete who has worked tirelessly to reach the pinnacle of his industry. Joe says he doesn't plan on wasting his chance.\n\n\"Six months in, I'm in the main event of SummerSlam, and my prospects beyond that look pretty good,\" Joe tells Rolling Stone. \"I absolutely did not know that I would not be in this spot right now, but I did know I would have the opportunity to make my spot in this match. When the opportunity was presented to me, I took full advantage of it and I find myself here now. ... Sometimes you've just got to knock on the door and keep knocking until they can't deny you and they let you in. Here I am.\"\n\nAlthough there was some moments where it seemed Joe's shot at WWE glory would never arrive, it eventually did, and he's maximized nearly every moment. His recent feud with Lesnar has captured the praise of fans and proved to any remaining doubters that he's more than capable of holding his own when the lights shine brightest.\n\nJoe got a chance to challenge Lesnar one-on-one for the title at WWE Great Balls of Fire in July, but after a highly physical encounter, he succumbed to \"The Beast\" and his trademark F-5 finisher. He will have two other men standing in his way when he takes his second crack at the belt, but regardless of the outcome, Joe hopes to battle with the former UFC Heavyweight champion Lesnar many more times in the future.\n\n\"The program with Brock, I'd love to explore it more and have many more encounters with Brock across the pay-per-view scale,\" Joe says. \"I think in general the build and everything going into this has been something that's peaked the interest of the general audience. Ratings are up, we are definitely drawing interest for the show.\"\n\nJoe feels he meshes well with Lesnar in the ring, and that's partially due to the fact both have hard-hitting styles that stem from martial arts backgrounds.\n\n\"People understand the simplicity of violence and martial arts has always been about the more efficient way to deliver said violence upon an adversary,\" Joe says. \"I've kept that philosophy as the focal point of what I do. ... Martial arts in general definitely influenced my style. I was a judo player as a kid and I think a lot of the concepts in judo as a kid played over. It influenced my style and has been a center point of what I do.\"\n\nJoe believes that his nearly 18 years in the industry has prepared him to deliver some of his best work at SummerSlam. It won't be an easy challenge to produce a match that meets the standards of everyone watching, but he holds strong faith in his ability to hold up his end of the bargain.\n\n\"As long as you're confident in your skill set and what you can do, you're usually good to go,\" Joe says. \"What I am capable of has got me very far thus far, so there's no real change to the game plan. I'll be able to go in there, and I know what I do. I know what I do well and I know what I can do with other people. It's all those factors in maintaining self-confidence and knowing that expectations are high and you've got to go in there and exceed those at the show.\"\n\nOver a long and prestigious career, Joe's seen and done almost everything in the sport. Winning a major championship under the WWE banner has eluded him, but SummerSlam presents a realistic chance to fill the missing gap on his resume.\n\nWhether Joe will be able to dethrone Lesnar, while also overcoming two of the most physically imposing members of the WWE roster in Reigns and Strowman, remains to be seen. Joe, however, feels he's ready to take on the responsibility that comes with carrying the Universal Championship.\n\n\"Going into SummerSlam, I go against some of the most accomplished performers in the world today and some of the hottest,\" Joe says. \"When you got guys in there like Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman - these are competitors which have the tendency to push their opponents to greater heights and great accolades. I hope the intensity will carry over and we'll deliver something spectacular.\n\n\"It's one of the biggest opportunities of my career without a doubt. Six months and this is my second shot at the Universal Championship. To add that to my resume and check that box amongst the accolades, it means a very great deal to me.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T13:15:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "13:15:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "score": 2}, {"id": "302655", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "score": 3}, {"id": "302772", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Judo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo", "score": 3}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "309979", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "score": 4}, {"id": "311156", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "score": 4}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 4}, {"id": "328692", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of WWE personnel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_personnel", "score": 1}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 3}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 3}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 3}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 3}, {"id": "343955", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE Network"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Network", "score": 3}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 3}, {"id": "351140", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "420594", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Great Balls of Fire"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Balls_of_Fire", "score": 3}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}], "image": "http://img.wennermedia.com/social/samoa-joe-story-wwe-1eccf7fe-5d20-4cb9-8e2d-518685a78c32.jpg", "timeCrawl": "13:15:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Samoa Joe on His Battle for the Universal Title at WWE SummerSlam", "originalArticle": null}

With a tremendous roster on board and a huge main event, Summerslam 2017 is shaping up to be one of WWE's biggest PPVs in recent memory.\n\nLast year's Summerslam was the first PPV since WWE took a big risk and reinforced the brand extension. Yet a lot of things have changed between then and now. WWE choosing last year's main event to be Brock Lesnar vs Randy Orton showed that even after the brand extension WWE still relied heavily on its veterans and had little faith in the new stars. This year, while Brock Lesnar will be in the main event once again, two fresh faces will now join him in Samoa Joe and Braun Strowman. With Roman Reigns also on that battlefield, this match promises to be a hell of a slugfest.\n\nWhat's especially intriguing about that match is that it wasn't made a Fatal 4 Way just because there wasn't anything else to do. This year WWE has taken to a lot of multi-man/woman matches simply because they couldn't come up with anything creative for some wrestlers. We've seen that bring a lot of damage to Smackdown's women's division. However, that isn't the case with the Universal championship match at Summerslam. The characters of each participant in the match are very well-defined and each of them has huge momentum. That has simply created a situation where no singles match between any of the four competitors can be as entertaining and colossal as the four men battling each other in the same ring at the same time.\n\nSummerslam will also feature Shinsuke Nakamura, who has been one of the hottest names in all of wrestling for many years, challenge for the WWE Championship for the first time ever.\n\nAdd to that the exciting drama between Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose and them most probably challenging Sheamus and Cesaro for the RAW Tag Team Championship, AJ Styles defending the US Championship against Kevin Owens with Shane McMahon as a referee, and John Cena vs Baron Corbin and you have an almost flawless show in Summerslam.\n\nThe reason almost was used there is because of the relatively weak midcard, particularly on the Smackdown Live side of things. As mentioned above, WWE currently has one of its strongest, if not indeed its strongest, roster ever. However, WWE is snubbing some of the roster's most talented wrestlers of chances to shine on Summerslam's huge stage.\n\nThere is always the 'there is only so much space on the card' argument and that is where this fan decides to step in. There are some modifications that WWE could have done to the card to present its roster with better chances. These modifications are yours truly's 5 Matches WWE Should Have Booked for Summerslam.\n\n1- 20 Man Battle Royal (Winner gets a championship opportunity of his choosing with 10 RAW and 10 Smackdown Live superstars)\n\nAdmittedly, a Battle Royal is not the most exciting match to book. However, with both RAW and\n\nSmackdown wrestlers in the same ring and a title shot hanging in the balance, the match should feel much more significant. The title shot also doesn't have to be on the winner's show so it's also a chance for wrestlers to switch brands.\n\nRAW participants: Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy, Apollo Crews, Kalisto, Elias, Bo Dallas, Curtis Axel, Heath Slater, Rhyno, and Cedric Alexander.\n\nSmackdown participants: Rusev, Luke Harper, Tye Dillinger, Erick Rowan, Aiden English, Mike Kanellis, Mojo Rawley, Zack Ryder, James Ellsworth, and a returning Kane.\n\nA win here could do wonders for guys like Rusev, Harper, and Crews. It may seem controversial that talents such as the Hardy Boyz do a Battle Royal. But with The Revival out of the picture, being featured in the Battle Royal would be better than facing off against momentum-less Gallows and Anderson. It would give both of them shots at single runs which is something that lots of fans have been asking for.\n\nEven though he's been getting lesser spotlight than his former partner Jason Jordan has, Chad Gable has been making the most out all of the opportunities he's received thus far. Someone who hasn't had any spotlight on him for a while though is Dolph Ziggler, who hasn't been on TV for over a month. A feud between these two would produce wrestling goodness.\n\nThe feud could have started with Dolph interrupting a Gable promo and admitting that Gable is immensely skilled but that he would go nowhere because he isn't the corporate's guys' kind of star. Dolph tells him that he had been there before himself and recalls every time he got pushed down by the machine. Gable tells him that he's just making up excuses for his own failure. Dolph gets livid and mercilessly assaults Gable. Gable then vows to get his revenge at Summerslam.\n\n3- Becky Lynch & Charlotte Flair vs Peyton Royce & Billie Kay\n\nBooking Natalya verus Naomi for the Smackdown Women's Championship at Summerslam isn't a bad decision. Natalya is long time veteran who can give the glowing babyface her toughest challenge yet and make her look great during the process. Though, not having Becky Lynch and Charlotte on the card is unfair to them and also an illogical decision, given their big star power.\n\nNXT's Iconic Duo haven't been doing much on NXT either. They have both already gotten multiple shots at Asuka and lost. They have now simply been relegated to being shown on backstage skits that serve to showcase other NXT talents. Their stint at Full Sail should've been over by now.\n\nThe road to Summerslam would have been a perfect opportunity to call Royce and Kay up to the main roster. And putting them against another team of best friends like Charlotte and Becky would show how cohesive they are together and help them establish a reign of dominance on Smackdown Live.\n\nThe UK wrestling scene has been producing some of the best in ring action this year. That's in large part thanks to WWE UK and Progress World Champion Pete Dunne. He's been extraordinary everywhere he's been from Progress to OTT.\n\nWWE's Cruiserweight division hasn't been on such a hot track. Neville is currently the only credible cruiserweight in WWE. No challenger at this point feels like he's worthy of beating Neville, producing a stalemate on WWE's 205 Live.\n\nPete Dunne could crash through the 205 Live roster and call them out for being weak. It wouldn't be long before Neville takes offense to Pete Dunne's actions. Neville fights back against Dunne and says that maybe the rest of the cruiserweights are not as competent as he is but he will continue to defend his kingdom. He challenges Pete Dunne to a match at Summerslam. Dunne accepts but says that he doesn't want to challenge for the Cruiserweight championship because being a champion of that division would only bring him shame. The two agree that the loser of the match would have to admit inferiority to the winner.\n\nThe match would have been a huge way for WWE to give its UK division much needed exposure after the promised weekly WWE Network show was delayed indefinitely. And it would have definitely been a much more heated match than the Neville vs Akira Tozawa rematch.\n\nThe biggest mistake fans won't forgive WWE for is not having Sami Zayn on the Summerslam card. Last year, WWE put him in an odd tag team match with Neville versus the Dudley Boyz on the Kickoff show and it looks like Sami will be in another throwaway bout on the Kickoff show again if he actually finds his way to Brooklyn this year at all.\n\nSami's career on the main roster thus far has been highlighted by weak inconsistent booking with his only two major moments being his victory over Kevin Owens at Battleground and surviving against Braun Strowman at Roadblock. Both of these moments were never capitalized on.\n\nRusev vs Randy Orton is also a mistake because at this point because neither of them can afford a loss. Rusev just made his much anticipated comeback last month only to be featured in an overdone feud that served to keep John Cena busy. Orton is just off a long rivalry with WWE Champion Jinder Mahal that hasn't done him any favors due to WWE portraying it as a USA vs India rivalry. Randy is not the kind of babyface that comes off as patriotic and quite frankly his best work has never been as a babyface. That's why his next feud shouldn't have been against a heel; not to mention, a heel who has been getting cheered for the past two years like Rusev. Orton's next feud should have set him up to turn heel again. And there's no better rival for that predicament than Sami Zayn.\n\nThe feud could have started right after Battleground as a furious Orton complains about his Punjabi Prison match before Sami interrupts him and tells him that he's received way too many opportunities at that point. Randy punches him in the face and they brawl before the rest of the roster breaks them up. The following week, Orton says that he had been holding off a lot in his chest for a while and that it's time to let it out. Orton says that he's not proud of the new generation of superstars, that most of them are incredibly overhyped by some nerds, and that Sami is on top of the list of guys he can't stand. Sami comes out and says that Orton may be right but there's only one way to prove it and that's by defeating him at Summerslam. Orton gladly accepts the challenge.\n\nThe match could be a star making opportunity for Sami Zayn. It wouldn't matter if he won or lost because his Smackdown PPV win/loss record is 2/1. As long as WWE would be willing to give Sami and Orton enough time to craft a Match of The Year contender, Sami would never leave the Barclays Center as a loser. The match could end with either Orton winning after using a heel tactic or Sami winning and then Orton brutalizing him.\n\nOrton could then go on to show more of the side that got him the only buzz he had this year when he savagely criticized independent wrestling. Perhaps he could even start a '.....Dive Open Challenge' on Smackdown where indie wrestlers would get a shot at beating Orton if they land a diving attack on him.\n\nSami would leave Summerslam as a resilient hero who gave everything he had and he would have an Apex Predator to get his revenge from which is a story that promises to be a thriller, given the quality of the babyface and heel involved.", "dateTime": "2017-08-14T23:42:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 28, "textStart": 14, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "23:42:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks", "score": 1}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 4}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

Barclays Center deleted a tweet that announced Lesnar would be on \"Monday Night Raw\" 24 hours after SummerSlam, according to Cageside Seats, potentially spoiling the result of the pay-per-view's main event.\n\nPaul Heyman has repeated on multiple occasions that Lesnar will leave WWE if his client loses the WWE Universal Championship at SummerSlam. Lesnar will defend his belt against Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe in a fatal 4-way match.\n\nOf course, Lesnar could lose his title and WWE could create a reason within the storyline why the former UFC Champion might show back up on TV. The more likely answer, however, is that Lesnar will remain the champion after Sunday night. He's the favorite to do so, having won the belt from Goldberg at WrestleMania 33 and successfully defended it against Joe at Great Balls of Fire.\n\nFor Cena, appearing on \"Monday Night Raw\" was the norm for many years. But the 16-time world champion has exclusively been a \"SmackDown Live\" performer since last year's brand split.\n\nJohn Cena, pictured before his match against Seth Rollins at WWE SummerSlam 2015 at Barclays Center of Brooklyn on Aug. 23, 2015 in New York City, could be on the same episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" as Brock Lesnar before the end of the summer. Photo: Getty Images\n\nCena wasn't moved during April's Superstar Shake-up, but WWE has made it clear that he will be showing up on \"Monday Night Raw\" at some point in the near future. Cena took a break from in-ring action for three months after beating The Miz at WrestleMania 33, and WWE described him as a \"free agent\" when he returned to WWE on July 4.\n\n\"The reason that I wanted to be a free agent and the reason they kind of granted my request is because I don't know if I'll be available for Smackdown specific only or Raw specific only, and I also know that my days are numbered,\" Cena told Complex last month. \"I just turned 40 in April and we have so many young and talented performers, I don't know how many years I have left. So in the time I have left, I'm gonna do what I can to dedicate to this company I just want to be able to do it the most time that I possibly can.\"\n\nCena will have a match against Baron Corbin at SummerSlam, and his free-agent status will allow him to face members of the \"Monday Night Raw\" roster at future PPV's. Don't be surprised if he challenges for the WWE Universal Championship at some point before the end of 2017.\n\nThe ability to appear on \"Monday Night Raw\" might ultimately lead to a clash between Cena and Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 34. That match would almost certainly be the main event of the April 8 PPV in New Orleans.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T19:56:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 418, "textStart": 411, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1568, "textStart": 1555, "date": "2015-08-23", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 2037, "textStart": 2031, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-04", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 3038, "textStart": 3031, "date": "-04-08", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "19:56:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "218049", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 1}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "323448", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kayfabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe", "score": 3}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 5}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 4}, {"id": "332484", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE brand extension"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Brand_Extension", "score": 2}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 3}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 3}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 4}, {"id": "340569", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Seth Rollins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rollins", "score": 2}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 4}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 3}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 3}, {"id": "361715", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Goldberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Goldberg", "score": 3}, {"id": "374391", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman", "score": 3}, {"id": "434925", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "The Miz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miz", "score": 2}, {"id": "607539", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "FedExForum"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedExForum", "score": 3}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 1}], "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/08/16/gettyimages-485063304_1.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:56:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "John Cena, Brock Lesnar Returning To 'Monday Night Raw' After SummerSlam 2017?", "originalArticle": null}

Mahal's strength and pride come from his people, and what better way than to celebrate than with a special performance. We get a drummer and some Indian dancers out to perform. Mahal then asks the fans, who he calls xenophobes, to rise so that a woman can sing the Indian national anthem. The fans of course shit all over it and we get more from the dancers. He says he will beat John Cena later on, because he's the new face of the WWE because he made the company a global phenomenon. John Cena lost to Nakamura in a dream match and he will beat Cena worse than Nakamura did, and Nakamura's dream, will become a nightmare at Summerslam. Mahal then talks to his people, and Nakamura interrupts. Mahal is insulted by the interruption, but the fans love it. Nakamura says today is India's independence day, but in Japan, it's a day to commemorate those who died in war. And on Sunday in America at Summerslam will be the day Mahal loses the WWE Title... to me! This was a solid little segment to hype the Summerslam match, but Mahal's promos all run together for me. \"I love India, I love my people, you hate me because I am Indian.\" Nakamura is still rough on promos, but they are smartly keeping them short.\n\n- Commentary gives an update on Ric flair.\n\n- Naomi makes her way out to watch the match, joining commentary.\n\nNatalya vs. Becky Lynch: They work some back and forth, with Becky scoring a near fall and then they brawl, Becky looks to attack the arm, but bails to the floor, Becky hits a baseball slide dropkick as we go screen in screen on the break. Natalya tries to stall a bit, and then begs off before sending Becky to the barricade. Natalya rolls her back in and grounds Becky. Back to full screen as Becky escapes the abdominal stretch and fires up with clotheslines. The XPLODER follows, and then the running forearm connects, with Becky covering for 2. Natalya counters the arm bar, they work into some counters, and Becky hits an enziguri. Becky heads up top, but MISSES the leg drop; Natalya locks in the sharpshooter and Becky has to tap. Natalya defeated Becky Lynch @ 7:32 via submission [**] This was a solid back and forth match with the right person going over, considering Natalya is challenging for the title.\n\n- Post match Natalya locks in the sharpshooter again, but Naomi makes the save. Carmella then makes an appearance. She reminds us that she's Miss Money in the Bank, and wishes them luck at Summerslam.\n\n- Commentary hypes the Styles vs. Owens feud, including footage of Styles accidentally kicking Shane last week.\n\n- Tamina bitches at Lana because she doesn't have a match tonight. Lana says she isn't ready, and says no one notices or fears Tamina. Lana says is she follows her lead, they will. She will manipulate her way to helping her, and then Tamina will become a destructive force and they will be unstoppable.\n\n- Bryan meets with the Usos. Bryan wants to join their rap group. But they want to now which New Day members they will face at Summerslam, it will be Big E and Woods. But the Usos want Kofi & Woods tonight.\n\nRusev vs. Chad Gable: These two had a really fun outing a few weeks back. Rusev attacks at the bell, beating down Gable with ease. Gable then hits an overhead belly to belly and they spill to he floor, where Rusev shoots Gable to the steps. Rusev tosses Gable over the announce table and we get a double countout. Rusev vs. Chad Gable went to a double countout @ 1:15 [NR] personally I am a bit disappointed, because I was looking forward to these guys tearing it up again. The double countout was a bit lame, but Rusev looked like a beat prior to being laid out as Orton got revenge for last week.\n\n- Post match, Rusev applies the accolade on the table. He then grabs the mic, but before could talk, Orton hit the #RKOouttanowhere.\n\n- Lawler, Lita, Rosenberg & Otunga are all on the Summerslam preview show. Kill me now.\n\nAJ Styles Apologizes to Shane McMahon: Styles makes his way out to the ring, and calls out Shane. He does his little dance and the fans are happy to see him. Shane tells Styles if he wants to apologize, there is no reason to do so. He's there to get in between he and Owens and take a hit if need be. Styles says that the kick was an accident, but wants to know if Shane will use this to screw him over at Summerslam. Shane says it was an accident, he was in the way and it was in the heat of the battle. On Sunday, if Styles pushes or shoves him, that's a different story because he will put his hands on Styles. Styles asks if that was a threat, Shane says that what happens on Sunday... but here comes Kevin Owens before Shane could continue. Owens doesn't believe last week was an accident. He wants to make something clear, and says if he makes contact with Shane on Sunday, it would be an accident. He knows Shane will call things down the middle and will be winning his title back. Owens offers to shake Styles' hand, things get chippy and Shane tries to break then up. Styles almost hits Shane but Shane blocks it and yells at him. This leads to Owens trying to superkick Styles, but he moves and Owens lays out Shane. I liked this and thought it was good. I dig the mind games they are playing heading into the match. I still think that the end game is Styles retaining, leading to Owens vs. Shane at HIAC.\n\n- New Day cut a pre-match promo, hyping tonight's match and the match at Summerslam.\n\nNon-Title Match: The Usos vs. Champions New Day (Xavier Woods & Kofi Kingston): Kofi controls at the bell, laying in kicks and then working quick tags with Woods as they keep a fast pace and work rapid fire double teams. The battle goes to the floor as we go screen in screen for the break. Back in the ring, the Usos take control of things working over Kofi. They ground him and keep him on tier side of the ring, while working quick tags. Back to full screen, Kofi works to his feet but quickly gets beat down. The heat is solid here; Kofi eventually hits a belly to back suplex and tags in Woods. He runs wild and hits the honor roll. The enziguri follows, Kofi blind tags in and New Day hits double superkicks for the near fall. The midnight hour is cut off, and the Usos attack Kofi's knee and hit double superkicks and pick up the win. The Usos defeated Champions New Day @ 7:23 via pin [**\u00be] This was pretty good, and while the New Day lineup will be different on Sunday, I am not a fan of WWE giving away another Summerslam match on TV. It feels lazy, like they had no idea how to fill their TV time this week.\n\n- Time for The Fashion Peaks finale. Fandango talks about the aliens probed him deep, mentally. Breeze is dressed in drag again, and says they need to solve some mysteries so that people don't think tat they are making this up as they go along. Fandango has a space rock and throws it. The Ascension arrives, returning the pie from last week. Fandango finds hair in it, and a Band-Aid. He then finds gluten and Viktor flips out because he lives a gluten free life. They then find a note that says \"Two B.\" Fandango licks the note as they fear for the entire tag division. They will return in two weeks. The mystery remains unsolved.\n\nNon-Title Match: WWE Champion Jinder Mahal vs. John Cena: We get the dueling Cena chants and they work a test of strength to begin. They work power for power, and the Singhs get involved allowing Mahal to take control. Cena sent to the floor as we go to commercial. Post break and Mahal controls as Phillips tries to sell this as the biggest main event in Smackdown history. Cena starts to make a comeback; plays the hits and the Singhs pull Mahal to the floor to save him. Cena chases, but the Singhs get involved again and then tossed to the back. Cena locks in the STF, but Mahal makes the ropes. Mahal fights off the AA and stuns Cena off the ropes. He follows with the knee strike for 2. Mahal sets for the khallas, but Cena powers out and hits the AA but Mahal kicks out. Cena seems shocked, but everyone kicks out of the AA it seems. Cena takes Mahal to the ropes, hits the second rope AA and Corbin is out for the DQ. John Cena defeated WWE Champion Jinder Mahal @ 10:04 via DQ [*\u00be] This was not a very good match at all, there was no sense of urgency, no drama and too much bullshit with the Singh brothers.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T01:19:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "01:19:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "113", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks", "score": 4}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 5}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 5}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 4}, {"id": "313992", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Gluten-free diet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free_diet", "score": 1}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

WWE also has announced that SummerSlam weekend will return to Brooklyn for a fourth consecutive year in 2018.\n\nMORE: NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III airs Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on WWE Network with Bobby Roode defending the NXT title against Drew McIntyre in the main event. After SummerSlam, the WWE Network will feature a bracketology special for the Mae Young Classic, the upcoming women's tournament that features 32 competitors from around the world. The first four hourlong episodes of the tournament will be available on WWE Network beginning Aug. 28.\n\nMORE WWE:\n\nJohn Cena has perfect response to fan who made obscene gesture to him\n\nSamoa Joe's long journey to WWE shows he's always ready to fight\n\nWWE's Alexa Bliss embraces being 'Five Feet of Fury'\n\nTHE RUNDOWN\n\nKICKOFF SHOW\n\nWWE Cruiserweight championship, Akira Tozawa defends against Neville. In a surprise, Tozawa won the title from Neville on Monday's RAW before the two were scheduled to meet at SummerSlam. Neville, who won the title in January, has been the one true star as WWE has tried to to get the cruiserweight division to gain traction with the fans.\n\nSmackdown Tag Team championship, The New Day defends against The Usos. Odd that this match ends up on the Kickoff Show, but that also might allow for more time with Kickoff Show extended to two hours. It also is unique that WWE revealed in advance which two members of The New Day would be competing.\n\nSix-man tag team match, Matt and Jeff Hardy and Jason Jordan against The Miz, Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel. A shoulder injury to Scott Dawson of The Revival left the Hardys without a SummerSlam opponent. A singles match between Jordan and The Miz on RAW marred by interference from Dallas and Axel led to a six-man match when the Hardys hit the ring. This is a rematch of that bout. This could be Jordan's opportunity to shine and potentially mean an Intercontinental title match against The Miz.\n\nMAIN SHOW\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass. It's a battle of the \"Bigs,\" but Cass is on the ascent after breaking up with longtime partner Enzo Amore. Cass, with help from Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, \"broke\" Big Show's hand on RAW and that injury provides an opening for WWE to continue to highlight Cass' vicious side. A win also will give Cass the bragging rights among big men. Amore will be suspended above the ring in a shark cage. The shark cage was a rarely used stipulation that has become in vogue with WWE as this will be its third use this year.\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev. The reasoning behind this match is a bit of a stretch. But with John Cena expected to move to RAW, 13-time former champion Orton will be needed to fill a bigger role on Smackdown. He is coming off a number of pay-per-view losses, so this is his chance to turn the tide.\n\nSmackdown Women's Championship, Naomi defends against Natalya. This seemed like an obvious spot for a Naomi victory and then Carmella cashing in the Money In The Bank briefcase. But with Baron Corbin cashing in his briefcase on Smackdown this week, it's hard to see WWE wanting neither briefcase in play so quickly. Natalya hasn't held a title since 2010 and her stalwart work in the ring and behind the scenes deserves to be rewarded. Rematches between Natalya and either Charlotte Flair or Becky Lynch would be great.\n\nBaron Corbin vs. John Cena. Cena is expected to head to RAW so WWE could build back up Corbin win a victory. If WWE still believes in Corbin - and that is in question after the usage of the Money in the Bank contract was squandered - he needs to win here. If it doesn't, Cena is still Cena and he gets the victory. Word is Cena's fiancee, Nikki Bella, who has not been on WWE programming since WrestleMania, could be at ringside with sister Brie.\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt. So much for a surprise return for \"The Demon.\" After getting doused with red goop Monday night on RAW, Balor will unleash his own demon character for the first time since his return from injury. Balor has largely been in limbo since coming back. Wyatt has had the advantage in this feud thus far. The return of the demon doesn't mean an obvious victory for Balor, but ...\n\nRAW Tag Team championship, Sheamus and Cesaro defend against Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose. Based on the crowd reaction, the fans really, really wanted a Shield reunion. And now they have it. As good as Sheamus and Cesaro have been, the time is right for Rollins and Ambrose, especially since the Hardys are the only other fan favorite tag team on the RAW roster.\n\nRAW Women's championship, Alexa Bliss defends against Sasha Banks. This gets interesting when you consider that the match was supposed to be Bliss against Bayley. A shoulder injury sidelined Bayley and Banks won a No. 1 contender's match against Nia Jax. That could open the door for Banks to get a more prominent title run. She is a three-time champion, but she and Charlotte flipped the belt several times in a short period of time. But there is argument to made that Bliss has been as good as anyone on either roster of late and more time with the title would only serve her well.\n\nUnited States championship, A.J. Styles defends against Kevin Owens. Styles and Owens have a history of show-stealing matches; the new dynamic here is that Shane McMahon serves as special referee. Well, Styles and McMahon worked each other at WrestleMania. Does this set the stage for Owens and McMahon at some point? After switching the title a few times, Styles should get a longer run. Owens has proved he can do virtually anything; he doesn't need a championship.\n\nWWE championship, Jinder Mahal defends against Shinsuke Nakamura. Many expected Cena in this spot - even Mahal had expressed an interest in facing the 16-time champion at SummerSlam. Here is where the \"business\" of the wrestling business applies: WWE is heading for a tour of India soon; having Mahal go into the tour as the champion makes sense. Nakamura is hugely popular and returns to Brooklyn, where he won the NXT title during SummerSlam weekend last year. Or could WWE get two bites of the apple by having Nakaura win in Brooklyn and then lose the title to Mahal in India?\n\nUniversal championship, Fatal Four-Way, Brock Lesnar defends against Braun Strowman, Roman Reigns and Samoa Joe. The good news is WWE will be just fine with any of them winning and a compelling argument can be made for each. A stipulation has been added that Lesnar and advocate Paul Heyman say they will leave WWE if Lesnar loses, citing the match is unfair to the champion. Lesnar does not have to lose to lose the belt. That stipulation plays into the furor of a possible Lesnar return to UFC to face Jon Jones. Lesnar isn't going anywhere until WrestleMania in April, but could he lose and move to Smackdown? We have seen Lesnar have one-on-one matches with Joe and with Reigns. We have yet to see one against Strowman - who keeps getting better and better. Lesnar could retain here and then meet Strowman next month at the No Mercy pay-per-view.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T19:32:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 202, "textStart": 195, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 889, "textStart": 882, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "19:32:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "313955", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "score": 4}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

He just finished up a program with Randy Orton that spanned three pay-per-views, with Mahal going over in each match.\n\nBut a few weeks ago, Mahal brought his belt with him to attend his brother's wedding in their hometown, north of the border, where Mahal's love for wrestling cultivated during his formative years.\n\nMORE: Getting a grip -- Ric Flair update, \"SummerSlam\" predictions\n\n\"Just growing up with Indian parents, my parents were at work a lot of the time, so I grew up just watching wrestling,\" Mahal said. \"This is how I learned about life. Through Bret Hart I learned anything is possible.\"\n\nMahal idolized Hart, following and trying to emulate his every move. Hart was the last Calgarian to hold a WWE Championship before Mahal won his off Orton at the \"Backlash\" pay-per-view in May.\n\n\"I might have put my brother in the Sharpshooter (when we were kids),\" Mahal said with a laugh.\n\nSo when Mahal returned home to celebrate his brother's wedding with his family, the belt came with him, making its triumphant return to Calgary.\n\n\"After 20 years it was very cool that the championship was back in the city,\" Mahal said. \"Their response was great. Everywhere I went in Calgary the city was very, very happy. The WWE universe now understands it's character-driven, it's entertainment, but it's still not everyday that there's a champion from the city. So everybody is proud of me.\"\n\nMahal's wrestling journey, one which saw him cut from WWE in 2014, dictates how he talks about his future. His rise in the company coincides with a self-described regained focus. He completely changed his eating and workout habits, adding 16 pounds of muscle. The wrestler fans see now is -- in some respects -- a caricature of the in-ring product they grew accustomed to.\n\nMORE: Three times wrestling fans didn't get who they wanted\n\n\"When I got released obviously it was a huge blow, I was disappointed, I was sad, all those things because I wanted to be a WWE superstar my whole life and to have that taken away from me did really suck,\" Mahal said. \"But at the same time I was kind of happy almost, too. Where I was at mentally, I wasn't really in the game 100 percent. I wasn't happy with my position, which was my fault.\"\n\nBig thanks to the @nutritionsolutions family and @chriscavallini for surprising me at the head office today. Changing my diet was one of the first steps I took, a very big step in my transformation which led me to become #WWEChampion. On one cake is a pic me before I regained my focus, and the other cake is a pic of me after my match at Backlash... ps. this doesn't mean I had any cake ..\n\nA post shared by The Maharaja (@jindermahal) on May 24, 2017 at 11:50am PDT\n\nBut even when WWE brought him back, Mahal said, where he's currently at physically and mentally is leaps-and-bounds a better position than when he was re-signed.\n\nChanging his life changed the company's attitude toward him as a performer, and then came his big push.\n\nAround \"WrestleMania 33,\" Mahal said he started hearing from a bunch of writers, including former WWE superstar and current backstage producer Road Dogg who told him \"big things coming after WrestleMania.\"\n\nThen he was moved to \"SmackDown,\" where Mahal said -- in his best-case scenario -- he believed he would be competing for either the United States or Intercontinental Championship, mid-card titles.\n\nMORE: Five main-event acts rejected by WWE fans\n\nThen finally came the night that Mahal finally realized the scope of the company's plans for him. He was backstage in the trainer's room during a taping of \"RAW.\" The WWE account tweeted that he would be a participant in a six-man match the following night to determine the No. 1 contender to face WWE Champion Orton. Mahal began to wonder who would win, thinking maybe it would be Luke Harper or Sami Zayn.\n\n\"At that time I was receiving tweets, people were like, 'Why is Jinder even considered in the No. 1 (contender) match?',\" Mahal said. \"And then one of the boys told me, 'You're going in with Randy next,' and I was like, 'What?' and then I saw Randy, he came into the trainer's room, and he was like, 'I think we're working soon.'\"\n\nFrom growing up dreaming of being a professional wrestler, idolizing Hart, making the company, but then getting cut, Mahal saw the fruits of his newest labor.\n\n\"WWE is very unpredictable,\" Mahal said. \"I knew even though I could be winning, I didn't want to get too excited. It was a weird feeling when I became WWE champion. I didn't have a huge moment of celebration because my goals were a lot bigger than this. I knew now I needed to step up.\"\n\nMahal is quick to note he doesn't want to be a flash in the pan. His long-term, personal itinerary includes being a multiple-time WWE Champion, and eventually a member of the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nMORE: \"WrestleMania\" matches that failed to deliver -- or didn't happen\n\n\"I had to prove myself in and outside of the ring because not only am I responsible for what happens inside the ring, but outside of the ring I represent WWE as a company,\" Mahal said. \"I'm the face of WWE. I'm very, very responsible. I take this very, very seriously. I'm not going to do anything to jeopardize the integrity of this championship, or the integrity of WWE.\"\n\nIn Mahal, WWE has a global face. He's billed as a champion who represents India. They've tacked on \"The Modern Day Maharaja\" as his nickname. He held a Punjabi celebration on \"SmackDown\" following his WWE Championship victory, and celebrated India's Independence Day this past Tuesday.\n\nIt's also a sensitive subject that Mahal is aware of. Positioned as a heel, fans boo him incessantly. In the promos he gives, he responds by saying they dislike him because he's different, which, in America's current cultural and socio-climate, is a topic that almost veers too from into kayfabe.\n\n\"WWE is very aware, and if anything were to ever arise I could speak up and say, 'I'm not comfortable doing this,' and for sure (WWE CEO Vince McMahon) wouldn't want to do it,\" Mahal said. \"WWE is very aware of sensitivity, and WWE is a global company. They don't want to offend anyone in any country.\"\n\nHe also said the WWE has long had a big presence in India, and though he's been with the company for years, his push only came after he started to really dedicate himself to the product.\n\n\"A lot of people say, 'Oh, you became champion because of India' but I was still the same person when I was when I got signed, when I debuted in 2011,\" Mahal said. \"(The Great) Khali raised it up to such a very high level, and they didn't make me WWE Champion or World Heavyweight Champion at that point. It wasn't until I was ready.\n\nMahal said he likes being booed. The heel is a dying breed in professional wrestling, Mahal said, but the reaction is one he has embraced.\n\n\"It's more fun being a bad guy,\" Mahal said. \"It's a cool dynamic now because the curtain has been pulled back a little bit. People know what we do is entertainment. So people like me, but instead of cheering me, they'll boo me out of respect. It's very cool nowadays.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T21:16:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3058, "textStart": 3046, "date": "2017-05-24", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "21:16:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "237367", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "323448", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kayfabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe", "score": 1}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 4}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 4}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 4}, {"id": "340547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Intercontinental Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Intercontinental_Championship", "score": 2}, {"id": "340548", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ric Flair"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Flair", "score": 3}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 3}, {"id": "340560", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bret Hart"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Hart", "score": 3}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 5}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 4}, {"id": "358016", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling aerial techniques"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques", "score": 2}, {"id": "358615", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling holds"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_holds", "score": 4}, {"id": "365537", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vince McMahon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon", "score": 1}, {"id": "378642", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Randy Orton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton", "score": 4}, {"id": "378751", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "score": 2}, {"id": "383371", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sami Zayn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Generico", "score": 2}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 4}, {"id": "434926", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling tag team match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_tag_team_match_types", "score": 2}, {"id": "529716", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Road Dogg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Dogg", "score": 2}, {"id": "655144", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brodie Lee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodie_Lee", "score": 2}], "image": "http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/28/71/jinder-mahal-wwe-wwe-ftr-081817_12a4y4tyuo9cz1x6ddwxhw5j56.jpg?t=-148054811", "timeCrawl": "06:34:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "WWE 'SummerSlam' 2017: Jinder Mahal discusses his unique rise to WWE stardom", "originalArticle": null}

Once again, the pay-per-view will be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn as will Raw on the following night, and those running the arena's social media may have gotten ahead of themselves. In the last week, a few tweets may have spoiled the PPV main event and a huge surprise for Monday.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, the official Twitter account of the Barclays Center took to promoting their huge WWE events coming up on Sunday and Monday. As reported by PW Mania, one of their tweets was for Monday Night Raw on August 21, and it revealed that Brock Lesnar will be there in person.\n\nUnfortunately for those that saw it, there was another bit of information in the tweet that was quickly deleted, but many still caught what it said.\n\n\"JUST ANNOUNCED: Universal Champion \"The Beast\" @BrockLesnar will be live on @WWE #RAW this Monday, 8/21! pic.twitter.com/FUAr7G2Bi7\n\n-- Barclays Center (@barclayscenter) August 16, 2017''\n\nAs you can see, it is saying that Brock Lesnar will be the Universal Champion on Monday night which means he would be the one winning in the main event of SummerSlam.\n\nMany said that they just said this because he is the current WWE Universal Champion, but it doesn't mean that SummerSlam was spoiled. Others pointed out the storyline where Paul Heyman said his client would leave WWE if he lost the Universal Title this Sunday at the PPV.\n\nIf Brock Lesnar is scheduled to be on Monday Night Raw, that seems to mean he will still be the champion by that time.\n\nThis tweet was deleted, but the Barclays Center Twitter account posted another spoiler-filled announcement last week. Everyone knows that John Cena is currently listed as a \"free agent\" and set to face Baron Corbin at SummerSlam, but Pop Culture caught a tweet that may have spoiled his return date to Raw.\n\nWith his free agent status, he can jump brands as he sees fit, but it appears he's headed for Monday nights very soon. It's just interesting that the Barclays Center left this tweet up but deleted the one about Lesnar.\n\nNo matter what ends up happening, WWE has the ability to change things up at the last minute and alter these spoilers if they're actually true. SummerSlam still has to take place on Sunday night before Monday Night Raw can begin, and that's a lot of decision making that needs to be done. Either way, it will be interesting to see if Brock Lesnar is still the Universal Champion and if free agent John Cena shows up for Team Red.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T02:49:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 681, "textStart": 672, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-21", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1079, "textStart": 1064, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "02:49:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302545", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "score": 3}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 5}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 4}, {"id": "323448", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kayfabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe", "score": 2}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 5}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 5}, {"id": "332484", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE brand extension"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Brand_Extension", "score": 2}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 4}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 4}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 3}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 2}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 4}, {"id": "374391", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman", "score": 2}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 2}], "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wwe-rumors-spoilers-barclays-center-summerslam-brock-lesnar-main-event-john-cena-monday-night-raw-2.jpg", "timeCrawl": "02:49:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "WWE Rumors: Site Of 'SummerSlam' Spoils Main Event And Huge Surprise For Next Week's 'Monday Night Raw'", "originalArticle": null}

For the third consecutive year, it will be at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and feature a full slate of matches from Raw and SmackDown Live.\n\nThe main event of SummerSlam will see Brock Lesnar defend the WWE Universal Championship against Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman, and Samoa Joe. If Lesnar loses, he will leave the WWE.\n\nJinder Mahal will defend the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. This is after Nakamura won a No. 1 Contenders match against John Cena on SmackDown Live.\n\nOutside of these two matches, there will be 10 others at SummerSlam. How could they all finish? Who will walk out with titles? Let's predict the entire show.\n\nRandy Orton and Rusev haven't had the best summers on SmackDown Live. They were in different positions on the match card but struggled to look competitive.\n\nOrton rivaled Jinder Mahal for three months as they battled for the WWE Championship. Mahal won the title at May's Backlash, which led to two more pay-per-view matches. The Viper lost both and seemed to be aimless.\n\nRusev was supposed to come back for Money in the Bank. Remember his demand for a title match at the June PPV? That never happened, and he didn't return until the first week of July, at the same time as John Cena. One messy Flag Match later and the Bulgarian Brute looked lost.\n\nSo when WWE has two superstars doing nothing, what do they do? They throw them into a match at SummerSlam with little-to-no build and hope they put on a good match. It's potentially a one-off before Orton and Rusev go in different directions, or the start of a program for the fall.\n\nGiven the Apex Predator's losses throughout the summer, look for him to rebound with a big win. This doesn't help Rusev, who will go grounded into SmackDown Live. When it comes down to these two stars, however, it will be the bigger name getting the win.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T10:04:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "10:04:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 3}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 2}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 5}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 4}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 3}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 5}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 4}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 3}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 3}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 3}, {"id": "378642", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Randy Orton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton", "score": 3}, {"id": "378643", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam (2013)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam", "score": 5}, {"id": "426498", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Alexander Rusev"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rusev", "score": 3}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 4}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}], "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/files/2017/08/WWE-SummerSlam-Fatal-4-Way.jpg", "timeCrawl": "13:32:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "WWE SummerSlam 2017: Preview and predictions", "originalArticle": null}

Nakamura is in a WWE Championship bout against Jinder Mahal. Joe is one of four hosses set to battle in a Fatal 4-Way match for the Universal Championship.\n\nYoung stars will make their SummerSlam debuts. Well-traveled grapplers just beginning to make their mark on WWE will grace the PPV's stage too.\n\nShort builds are poised to hamper a handful of the bouts, but there should be plenty of thrillers and memorable moments at the summer blockbuster. Count on AJ Styles and Kevin Owens to deliver in their U.S. title bout. And don't sleep on Alexa Bliss vs. Sasha Banks for the Raw Women's Championship.\n\nOn Sunday, Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, is set to welcome stars old and new, talent representing the past and the future, in one of WWE biggest events of the year.\n\nPaul Heyman has promised that if Lesnar loses on Sunday, both he and his client will leave WWE. That subplot added a great wrinkle and deepened the suspense around the bout. That was until Barclays Center's social media team jumped the gun.\n\nAs Total Wrestling magazine pointed out, the arena's Twitter account announced Lesnar would be at Raw the next night:\n\nThat points to Lesnar retaining the Universal Championship. Barclays Center staff aren't the only ones providing potential spoilers on the bout. As Dave Meltzer noted on Figure Four Online: \"Lesnar is advertised for more dates after the pay-per-view as well.\"\n\nNikki Bella mentioned that she would be in the front row for fiance Cena's match against Baron Corbin:\n\nHer sister may make an appearance as well. Brie Bella is set to be in SummerSlam's host city. Mike Johnson of PWInsider.com said \"Brie Bella will be in New York City this weekend,\" noting that she would be in town to film Total Divas.\n\nAnd as for whether Carmella will cash in her Money in the Bank contract on Naomi or Natalya come Sunday, she hinted at waiting to pounce. In an interview with Gorilla Position (via Ash Rose of TalkSport), The Princess of Staten Island said: \"At the moment, my plan is to hold onto the contract as long as I can.\"\n\nThe numbers are likely to shift again just before the PPV, but the betting odds suggest we'll see three new champions crowned at Barclays Center. The numbers also point to Cena breaking his six-match losing streak at SummerSlam on Sunday.\n\nThe SummerSlams odds, as of Friday, are as follows, per OddsShark:\n\nCass is the biggest favorite of the night with minus-600 odds (bet $600 to win $100). That's an implied probability of 85.7 percent. It looks like Amore is going to have watch his former friend score his biggest career win to date.\n\nThe slow, hesitant reunion of Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins has been one of Raw's best stories during SummerSlam season. The two former members of The Shield still don't trust each other, but they have decided to unite against a common enemy.\n\nNamely Raw tag champs Cesaro and Sheamus.\n\nCesaro and Sheamus began as hated enemies who were forced together as a duo. They are now a cohesive, overwhelming machine.\n\nAmbrose and Rollins' reunion will be fun to watch. The action is sure to be hard-hitting. And the threat of the challengers imploding mid-match will add plenty of suspense.\n\nAJ Styles and Kevin Owens have traded the U.S. title over the past few weeks.\n\nKO was robbed of his latest attempt to win the gold back when a referee mistakenly counted to three while Owens' shoulders were up. SmackDown Live Commissioner Shane McMahon has stepped in to make sure there are no mistakes this next time around.\n\nMcMahon has quickly become as vital to this narrative as Styles and Owens. His past as a shady referee, his violent history with Styles and the tension between him and KO add depth to a match made fresh by his addition.\n\nStyles and Owens haven't yet had the truly great match fans have been expecting from them. If Shane-O-Mac's presence deepens the bout rather than gets in its way, that is set to change on Sunday.\n\nAlexa Bliss thought she was going to face Bayley at SummerSlam, but a shoulder injury forced WWE to shift gears. Banks won a Triple Threat match and then defeated Nia Jax to earn the right to be Bayley's replacement.\n\nAnd The Boss is ready to get her hands on the woman who evaded her at Great Balls of Fire in July.\n\nThe rivals' well-documented real-life tension is sure to add to the in-ring excitement. Their strong chemistry assures that this will be one of the night's better offerings.\n\nWWE could mix things up too, by inserting Bliss' sometimes bodyguard, Jax, or having Banks' friend Bayley play into this as an invested spectator.\n\nSmackDown's penchant for throwing curveballs continued through the road to SummerSlam when Nakamura pushed past Cena to claim the No. 1 contender's spot for the WWE crown.\n\nThat created a meeting between two men making their SummerSlam debuts in a high-profile bout for the company's oldest title.\n\nMahal shocked the world by even being in this spot. He went from midcarder to marquee star in a rapid rise during the spring. After dispatching Orton several times, he is set to face a man with an unpredictable style and a mule-like kick.\n\nTheir clash of styles alone will be worth watching as the slower-paced Mahal collides with the electric showboat that is The King of Strong Style.\n\nGet ready to rearrange your Match of the Year lists. The Fatal 4-Way match for Lesnar's universal title is going to be a slobberknocker for the ages.\n\nStrowman blasted Reigns at Great Balls of Fire to put himself into the contender conversation. Reigns believed he deserved a shot thanks to his lengthy resume and the beating he put on The Monster Among Men after losing to him. Joe nearly toppled Lesnar at that same July PPV.\n\nChaos unfolded, with Raw general manager Kurt Angle trying to figure out which Superstar should face The Beast Incarnate. So he opted to put all three of them into the battle.\n\nHe made the right choice.

The WWE title match against Shinsuke Nakamura at Sunday's pay-per-view will be the biggest bout of his career. This will all come after the comic relief-turned-headliner experienced one of the most surprising turnarounds ever.\n\nBut this isn't the climax of Mahal's journey in his mind. This is simply the beginning.\n\nThe Maharaja remains humble despite the gold he carries over his shoulder and being positioned as SmackDown's top heel. He's hungry, focused and still in awe of where he is today.\n\n\"I've never performed at a SummerSlam event before,\" Mahal told Bleacher Report. \"And to come in as WWE champion against someone like Shinsuke Nakamura who is already a legend in the business, it's a very, very special moment.\"\n\nHis uncle Gama Singh, a wrestling star in Canada in the '70s and '80s, helped instill that attitude.\n\nMahal was a young boy when Singh prowled the rings in Calgary, Toronto, and beyond. But when Mahal decided to enter the squared circle himself, his uncle helped guide him. Bad News Brown, Gerry Morrow and Singh all had a hand in training a young Mahal.\n\n\"As I was getting into this business, he was a huge help, someone to go to for advice,\" Mahal explained.\n\nAfter winning the WWE title from Randy Orton at Backlash in May, the new champ's celebration didn't end in the ring. He showed off his newly won prize with a man he views as a mentor and father figure.\n\n\"I was able to take the WWE Championship over to his house, and he was very proud. We took some pictures. It was a very proud moment, a cool moment,\" Mahal recalled.\n\nNow that Mahal is on top of the WWE world, his uncle has offered words of wisdom that echo in his head: \"Remain humble. Don't let all this get to your head. This doesn't last forever.\"\n\nIn his hometown of Calgary, Mahal first put his uncle's teaching to the test as a member of Stampede Wrestling.\n\nThe promotion was also home to Tyson Kidd, David Hart Smith, Natalya and Viktor of The Ascension, who would all later make their way to WWE. Mahal referred to them as a close-knit group. He said many of his peers at Stampede Wrestling were \"already great wrestlers\" when he arrived on the scene and remembers those beginnings fondly.\n\n\"The crowds weren't always the biggest, but we just had all this passion. We were lucky enough to get to perform every week in Calgary,\" he said.\n\nThe size of the audiences ballooned big time when Mahal made his SmackDown debut in 2011.\n\nBut his ride to the top sputtered out before it really got started. WWE reassigned him to its developmental territory in 2012, and he later re-emerged alongside Drew McIntyre and Heath Slater as 3MB, a trio of wannabe rockers with a penchant for playing air guitars.\n\nThe comedy group lasted until the summer of 2014, when WWE released both McIntyre and Mahal.\n\nThree years later, Mahal is poised to defend the WWE title at SummerSlam. McIntyre will challenge Bobby Roode for the NXT Championship at TakeOver: Brooklyn III the night before.\n\nReflecting on how far his friend and former stablemate has come, Mahal said, \"To see where he is now is just a testament to the hard work he's put in.\"\n\nMahal is confident McIntyre is in line for big things.\n\n\"I definitely know he's going to be WWE champion some day,\" Mahal promised. In fact, he said that before McIntyre was set to wrestle one night, Mahal texted him: \"Be careful, we have a WrestleMania to main event someday.\"\n\nWWE cutting both men fueled them.\n\n\"Both of us have a chip on our shoulder because we were released. I know that I do,\" Mahal said. \"I hope I never lose that chip. It motivates me. It keeps me working hard each day.\"\n\nThat drive has him seeing beyond the title matches this weekend, beyond where he stands today. The Maharaja believes the future is bright for both him and McIntyre.\n\n\"This is just the beginning for both of us. We have a long career ahead of us. He's 32, I'm 31,\" Mahal said. \"We haven't even hit our prime yet. And I'm excited to see what the future brings.\"\n\nThe immediate future is a date with Nakamura, the eccentric Japanese star known for swift kicks and kneeing people in the head.\n\nAfter a series of clashes with Orton, Mahal will have to make a major adjustment. Orton and Nakamura's styles couldn't be more different. The Viper has a more traditional approach, with a slower pace and homages to the likes of Ronnie Garvin and his father Cowboy Bob Orton. Nakamura instead seems to be channeling Freddie Mercury of Queen in the ring.\n\nMahal was impressed with what he saw out of Orton from close range.\n\n\"He's a natural. I've never been in the ring with someone like that. Randy just makes it looks so, so easy,\" Mahal said.\n\nAs for The King of Strong Style, Mahal isn't as sure what to expect.\n\n\"He's hard to study. He's hard to predict,\" Mahal explained. \"He's a lot more unpredictable. He's surgical with those strikes. He's a different kind of intense.\"\n\nAnd even though Nakamura has been IWGP heavyweight champion for New Japan Pro Wrestling and wrestled in the Tokyo Dome, Mahal called this SummerSlam clash Nakamura's biggest match yet.\n\n\"This is WWE. This is the WWE Universe. This is SummerSlam. This is Barclays,\" he said.\n\nWith that constant chip on his shoulder, The Singh Brothers in his corner and the WWE title on the line, Mahal is ready to make the most of that stage. In part, he wants to represent the SmackDown brand, to outdo Raw, which is nothing new.\n\n\"The whole SmackDown roster has a chip on its shoulder.

This year, all but one championship will be on the line on a night that could be Brock Lesnar's last in WWE.\n\nHere is your guide to what to look for and expect when the company's second biggest pay-per-view invades Brooklyn, starting with a two-hour pre-show at 5 p.m. on the WWE Network.\n\nThe Universal champion's advocate Paul Heyman has said they both will leave WWE if Lesnar is not victorious in a fatal-four-way match for his title against Samoa Joe, Braun Strowman, and Roman Regins. UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones has already called out Lesnar, so there is a real-life reason to hype up the storyline and believe this situation is real.\n\nIt likely is not. Lesnar's deal with WWE reportedly ends with next year's WrestleMania and he would still need to finish out the second half of his USADA suspension from UFC 200 last July. The Beast and the title are probably staying put.\n\nNakamura, an international superstar, earned his match with WWE champion Jinder Mahal by beating John Cena clean in a No. 1 contender's match. The match has gotten very little build and Nakamura's push has been gradual since debuting on the main roster. This goes one of two ways: Nakamura wins clean and a long title reign begins or Mahal's buddies the Singh Brothers interfere and Nakamura gets cheated out of a victory or wins by DQ to set up a rematch with higher stakes.\n\nWWE squandered one of its biggest cheat pop elements Tuesday night on SmackDown Live when Baron Corbin waited too long to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase for Mahal's WWE title. Instead of a huge story-turning moment, Corbin was rolled up by Mahal and lost - much to the joy of his SummerSlam opponent John Cena.\n\nThe flawed decision not only downgraded Corbin's character, it took the briefcase off the table Sunday and likely means we won't see Carmella cash her's in on the winner of Naomi and Natalya's SmackDown women's title match. Expect Carmella to at least try to cash in because the moment has been teased too much for her not to.\n\nFormer Shield members Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins finally got on the same page last week, both putting their fists out in solidary. They now get a chance to win the Raw tag team title from Sheamus and Cesaro.\n\nBig Cass and Enzo Amore couldn't be further apart after Cass turned heel and Amore's new friend Big Show will try to teach him a lesson. There is a chance for Show to be double-crossed, but it more likely only one of these pairs of brothers leaves Brooklyn together.\n\nFinn B\u00e1lor's demon king persona (full body paint and all) will return to television for the first time since he won the Universal title last year at SummerSlam. He and b , whose own entrance is a thing to behold, have all ready played the magical powers game during the build. Expect the lights to go out once, maybe twice during their match.\n\nBrock Lesnar (C) over Roman Reigns, Samoa Joe and Braun Strowman for the Universal title\n\nBrock isn't ready to go anywhere and neither is the Universal title. He pins Stroman or Reigns to protect a rematch with Samoa Joe.\n\nShinsuka Nakamura over Jinder Mahal (C) for the WWE title\n\nNakamura winning or losing can both be good business, but can't see WWE bringing him this far without him getting the belt.\n\nA.J. Styles (C) over Kevin Owens for the U.S. title (Shane McMahon guest referee)\n\nShane has already fought Styles and there is recent tension between Owens and McMahon. Shane O'Mac costs Owens the belt.\n\nDean Ambrose and Seth Rollins over Cesaro and Sheamus (C), Raw tag team titles\n\nThe build for this has been near flawless and an Ambrose-Rollins reign means money and big matches - and more of both when they split them up.\n\nNaomi (C) over Natalya for the SmackDown women's title\n\nThe WWE has put zero meaningful storytelling behind this match. That screams the Naomi is retaining and Carmella will taunt her with a potential cash in.\n\nAlexa Bliss (C) over Sasha Banks for the Raw women's title\n\nBanks was put into this match last minute after Bayley's shoulder injury, so Bliss uses some underhanded way to escape with the belt.\n\nJohn Cena over Baron Corbin\n\nIt's been reported that WWE has soured on Corbin - hence why his cash in went so wrong. Cena just lost clean to Nakamura. Cena wins with an AA or by DQ.\n\nRandy Orton over Rusev\n\nThe rebuild of Orton started with a win over Mahal and it continues here with an RKO to Rusev.\n\nFinn B\u00e1lor over Bray Wyatt\n\nBoth need to start getting pushed, but WWE is not losing the invincibility of Balor's demon persona on Bray Wyatt.\n\nBig Cass over Big Show (Enzo Amore suspended in a shark cage)\n\nBig Cass is WWE's new giant and a win does nothing for Big Show (and his broken right hand) and Enzo.\n\nNeville over Akira Tozawa (C), Cruiserweight title\n\nTitus Brand and Tozawa had their moment when he won the title, Neville gets it back here and this entertaining feud continues.\n\nThe New Day (C) over The Usos for the SmackDown tag team titles\n\nNew Day is known for LONG title reigns. No reason to switch the belts again so quickly.\n\nJason Jordan and the Hardy Boys over The Miz and the Miz Miztourage\n\nJordan's big push continues, good guys beat bad guys and the crowd loves it.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T15:23:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "15:23:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 4}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

It's that time of year again! One of the greatest events of the summer is finally within reach. This year, WWE's SummerSlam will be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. The event takes place on August 20, putting the excitement just a mere two days away. This year, the show has a fully stacked match card.\n\nSo, are you excited?\n\nWith as much criticism as the WWE has been faced with recently, I really think this show is going to deliver. Still, I often find myself thinking \"hmm...\" during outcomes that I don't necessarily agree with. Many of us joke about how we would write the show. So, I decided to do just that. I've also included some of the predictions out there, but mainly I'm sticking to how I think SummerSlam ought to be presented.\n\nFirst off, I can't help but wonder why the Hardyz are paired with JJ. With Jordan in a strange storyline involving Kurt Angle as his father, shouldn't he be doing something more? It makes sense that Angle would favor Jason Jordan and give him opportunities for no reason. If I were writing for this, I would do exactly that.\n\nNonetheless, I think that the Miz is stellar with anyone in the ring, and he'll probably put on a good show with Jordan. Hopefully, this leads to a nice feud between Jason Jordan and Miz, because I'm certain that the chemistry between them would blow the roof off from any establishment. That being said, Kurt Angle should eventually involve himself in the feud, ultimately leading to a JJ intercontinental championship run.\n\nPrediction: Jason Jordan and the Hardyz\n\nI just don't know about this one. Neville has proven to be leaps and bounds ahead of his colleagues, and maybe even is ready to return to the main roster. And while Tozawa has improved greatly in the recent weeks, the cruiserweight division as a whole is just very weak.\n\nWhen the WWE took the belt off from Neville this last Friday, it was definitely a \"hmmm...\" moment for me. I'm not really convinced that Tozawa can carry the division the same way that Neville has. That being said, I fully expect and would personally book Neville to win the belt back in a cheap fashion. Then, as punishment for the cheap win, he ought to put up the belt at a later pay-per-view against many other superstars. Or, perhaps a battle royal to name a number one contender for Neville. That way, the WWE would be able to develop other feuds as well as introduce new, fresh faces. I'm lookin' at you, Enzo Amore!\n\nPrediction: Neville wins the belt via roll-up or other controversial way.\n\nSince the card is already super-stacked, it's no surprise that the WWE moved this stellar match to the pre-show. Sad as it is, it will enable the superstars to really showcase the things that they can do. The New Day is so over with fans right now that they don't necessarily need the belts. I'm hoping to see the Usos take this one, mostly because I would love to see them eventually drop them to a different face team. You know the one. Yes, I'm thinking Breezango ought to have a short run with the belts at some point. Until that happens, the Usos and New Day work well together, and can continue their feud for awhile.\n\nPerhaps in the meantime, the WWE can get their tag-team division going one again.\n\nPrediction: The Usos win the belts.\n\nI hate the shark cage idea. So, so much. It worked fine for the Authors of Pain in NXT, and it was watchable with Chris Jericho suspended up in the air. Still, something like this shouldn't be utilized three times in less than a year. Cass has proven he can handle Show. He's smashed Enzo's face in plenty of times.\n\nIf this match has to happen, I guess I'd have Enzo try to help out Big Show and drop him down a weapon to be intercepted by Cass. But since that happened with Kevin Owens and Jericho (kind of), that's just repetitive and nobody wants to see that. But then again, who wants to see this match at all?\n\nMy hope is that Gallows and Anderson continue to align themselves with Cass. Once Enzo's let out of the cage, I would want the three to go after the little guy. That way, maybe the WWE would redirect Enzo Amore to 205 Live. It might be a decent way to write him off of the main roster, which has been in the talks for the last few weeks.\n\nPrediction: Big Cass wins.\n\nFriends, this is lazy writing at it's finest. Randy Orton is finished with Jinder Mahal, and now he's moved on. But why? That's exactly it: the WWE hasn't given us a reason to look forward to this match. Not only do I not care who wins, I also don't understand what the stakes are. Is it because they just don't like each other?\n\nThe only way to make this match relevant is to give the two men plenty of time and a nice, lengthy bout. I'd love to see Lana get herself involved, too. Maybe we can even have Orton take an intimidating step towards her...a glimpse into an old gimmick that just worked for him. Orton needs to get back to his heel roots.\n\nRusev could be a fantastic mid-card mainstay, but instead, he hasn't done much. With the right match and feud, Rusev could be shot to the level he is capable of.\n\nPrediction: Rusev wins.\n\nUnfortunately for Naomi, her run as champ has been underwhelming. There's been rumors that the WWE and Mattel are in cahoots to make a toy version of her light-up belt. In order to properly market the item, it only makes sense for Naomi to continue to be champion. However, there have been reports that the toy belt won't be ready in time for Christmas. Maybe, then, the WWE wont look at this as a marketing scheme and make a logical choice.\n\nGIVE NATALYA A CHANCE. Natalya hasn't held gold in forever. She's one of the most legitimate women in the ring, and putting the belt on her for now makes sense. She's earned it, and she sure deserves it. That being said, a lot of people think it's time for Carmella to cash in her briefcase. And, yeah, the WWE hasn't done well with surprises lately. It seems too obvious, which is why I think they will do that. It would be a good way to set up Carmella and Natalya in a feud, anyway.\n\nBut if I could, I'd keep the belt on Natalya for awhile. Carmella is fine as she is now, but I think she could be even better. Hopefully she drops James Ellsworth, too....\n\nPrediction: Natalya wins the belt.\n\nI don't know about this one, either. Why in the world did WWE give Baron the briefcase if they weren't confident that he could deliver? I don't hate Baron Corbin, but he's not really ready for a title. Then again, neither was Jinder Mahal, and that didn't really stop the company from forging the path.\n\nLuckily, John Cena had some part do with Corbin's failed cash-in. That gives some necessary buzz to the match, because I think Baron Corbin will absolutely brutalize John Cena. I don't foresee the Lone Wolf winning at SummerSlam, but I so wish that he would. Picture a bloody John Cena in the middle of the ring. Now, picture the gorgeous Nikki Bella at ringside, looking like she's going to cry. And now, picture Baron Corbin looking at her and laughing as he stands over Cena's body. Heel status? Over 9000.\n\nWishful thinking. But, nonetheless, I think Baron Corbin is receiving some kind of punishment from officials here. Expect the shovel to come out. #buried\n\nPrediction: John Cena wins.\n\nI so hated this feud at first. But then, Bray Wyatt does what he always does. He gets crazy and drops blood buckets on people's heads.\n\nOkay, so he doesn't do that all the time. But he did it to Finn Balor, which guaranteed the return of the \"demon\" persona that has been totally ignored since his return. So far, Bray has won the psychological warfare between the two.\n\nBut once the Demon Finn Balor appears, all of that is going to change. Maybe the two should conclude the match with shaking hands or something, because they are totally on the same page. But in my world, I would do something way more interesting.\n\nNow, what I would love to see Bray Wyatt to finally introduce the Sister Abigail character. If he's going to lose, have it be based off from a distraction of sorts. A creepy, ghost-like figure outside the ring, perhaps? Even if she isn't a real person immediately (as there are plenty of women running through the Mae Young Classic right now), it would help recharge his character. Start with vignettes and attacks and really build the intrigue. Not to mention, bringing in a manager-like role for him could get him the upper hand in the future. Sister Abigail should be along with her kayfabe brother at WrestleMania, for sure.\n\nAgain, wishful thinking, as Finn Balor is probably going to take this one, clean as a whistle.\n\nPrediction: Finn Balor wins.\n\nSheamus and Cesaro have been fantastic together, especially following their heel turn. With Matt and Jeff Hardy out of the picture for now, they've been running the division on the red brand. Meanwhile, Dean and Seth haven't exactly been on the same page.\n\nStill, we've all been dying to see a Shield reunion, and we kind of have one. Even though they probably won't last for long before the cracks begin in the foundation, I'm willing to enjoy the ride for now. I predict a Dean Ambrose heel turn coming up, because his gimmick has gotten super-stale. What I'd love is for both men to turn heel and act as enforcers as they used to. Remember when they worked alongside CM Punk? Good times.\n\nI don't foresee Roman Reigns joining in on this party, though, because it looks like the WWE is still busy pushing him to the moon. Too bad, because it might have worked to reform them completely. If the Shield can't get Roman Reigns over, I'm not sure anything else can.\n\nPrediction: Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins win the titles.\n\nIn a perfect world, Alexa Bliss would have the title forever. That's not going to happen. Sasha Banks deserves time to shine here, and it's going to be a lengthy title run. Now, here, two things could happen. Sasha Banks defends her title against Nia Jax, only to have Alexa turn on her \"Team Rude\" partner (or vice-versa, establishing Bliss as a face.)\n\nWith Bayley out of the picture for a while, hopefully Sasha Banks can establish herself as a heel once again. As a babyface, she's boring. On the bright side, working with Alexa Bliss has brought out some spark in Banks.\n\nSide note: I really miss Paige. She could bring awesome diversity to the roster.\n\nAnother side note: Is there a rule that says Carmella can't cash in on a RAW superstar? Because that would be stellar if she cashed in on Banks. Just saying. Not to mention, it'd put her on the road with real-life boyfriend, Big Cass.\n\nPrediction: Sasha Banks wins the title.\n\nI love both competitors, and I love this match. I think that if the WWE wants Kevin Owens to square off against Shane McMahon, though, he should definitely lose this match. Maybe Shane misses a crucial call, which sets off the eventual match between the two. I mean, Survivor Series is right around the corner.\n\nBut what's more, is the possibility of including Shinsuke Nakamura into the US title picture. We could finally see the showdown we want between the two men. So, obviously, AJ Styles needs to retain.\n\nPrediction: AJ Styles retains the belt.\n\nWith the WWE heading to tour in India soon, this is a no-brainer. Right?\n\nThat's what I think, too. Fans are going to go crazy when they find out Nakamura lost to Jinder. But I can almost be certain that's how it's going to go. Let's face it: With Corbin's failed cash-in, I think the WWE is at a loss for another potential candidate...at least for now. Logically, that means they're going to keep the title on Jinder Mahal.\n\nI expect to see the Singh Brothers here, and if I were writing the show for the night, I'd include them as well. I don't think Jinder will win because of their interference, though. He needs to squeak out a V against the King of Strong Style.\n\nI would totally love to see Sami Zayn be the reason Shinsuke fails to capture the title. Heel Sami might be interesting, and if you didn't see Sami Zayn and Nakamura duke it out in NXT, you should probably go watch that. Who wouldn't want to see another round?\n\nIn the long run, the WWE needs to begin grooming someone to take the title off from Mahal. Otherwise, we're going to see a John Cena 17th world title run. Let's be real: WWE loves to use their \"safe guys\" when they're uncertain.\n\nAnd, again, I fully expect Shinsuke Nakamura to defeat AJ Styles for the US Championship at WrestleMania next year.\n\nPrediction: Jinder Mahal retains the title.\n\nThe stipulation here is far too convenient for Brock Lesnar to lose. Sorry, guys.\n\nSee, if Brock loses, he and Paul Heyman leave the WWE. With the hype of a Lesnar-Jones fight in the UFC, it isn't a surprise that the WWE is going to capitalize on that. People are going to watch this match simply to find out if Brock goes back to the octagon.\n\nI expect this match to be freakin' ridiculous. I mean, brutal. With tons of insane spots and blood and suplexes. I would like to see Brock Lesnar drop the belt, because without a regular champion around, the belt doesn't feel very important. In the meantime, Roman and Strowman are busy killing each other. Samoa Joe has held his own, too.\n\nAlthough I think that the Beast Incarnate is going to hang on to the strap, I would book things way differently. First idea? Play the Undertaker's gong right before a victory. Seeing the Dead Man go out on his back didn't seem real or fair. He's got heat with both Brock and Roman, anyways. I'd like to see all three of them in a title match at next year's WrestleMania. After all, he lost in New Orleans once to Lesnar. He really ought to go out riding high, retiring completely after winning the Universal championship in 2018.\n\nOr, I would do something totally unheard of. I'd have Paul Heyman screw Brock over. Nobody in the world would expect that, anyways. Heyman has been trying to push for a Samoa Joe title run, so maybe aligning Joe with the mouthpiece would be a good move? But, then again, that would guarantee that Brock Lesnar disappears. But wouldn't that mean that Heyman does, too?\n\nAlright, so that's all from me! Please, feel free to leave a comment below on what you would do if you were a writer. Which match are you most looking forward to? Do you think my predictions are totally off, or spot on?

The match should be fine (and will probably have its time cut if the company's history with women's matches on big shows is any indication) but the likelihood of a cash-in will be the talking point.\n\nOutside of these two matches, there will be 10 others at SummerSlam. His matchup against Brock Lesnar is also a fresh one and could help Strowman get over even more. Cena has not missed a SummerSlam event since making his first appearance in 2004. After the summer slump, SummerSlam is a chance to interject new life into the show through exciting new feuds that will culminate at WrestleMania. This card already has more matches than last year's show had, which went over six hours counting the Kickoff Show.\n\nFor Corbin, it's hard to imagine him being thrust into the championship spotlight anytime soon if he were to not only fall to Cena, but do so without a briefcase to fall back on.\n\nRusev was supposed to come back for Money in the Bank. Gothamist reports that the group, led by thirty year-old John Stevens, were outside of the event protesting due to Trump's press conference in which the President said that \"many sides\" were at fault for the Charlottesville violence and said there were \"some very fine people\" on the alt-right side. For a while, there have been rumors saying that Brock will hold onto the Universal title until then and that he'll defend it against Roman Reigns on \"the grandest stage of them all\".\n\n- Wyatt has not lost in singles competition at SummerSlam, defeating Kane in a Ring of Fire match in 2013 and besting Chris Jericho in 2014.\n\n- Banks is a three-time champion, but each of her title victories occurred on Monday Night Raw.\n\nIn 2016, Joe and Nakamura met on Saturday to grapple for the NXT Championship, the night before \"SummerSlam\", in NXT's \"Takeover: Brooklyn II\" event.

I'm keeping the big man alive in the business and evolving it into what you are seeing now with the Braun Strowman character.

It was a big moment for me going out there and having that kind of match with Big Show.\"\n\nRelationship with Vince McMahon:\n\n\"Vince has been adamant that everything I do be spot-on, and when it's not, I know. That's part of the reason I take pride in what I do and give 100 percent of what I am capable of giving. That's because I know that not only are there millions of fans watching to make sure I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing, but the boss himself is watching, too. He is so hands-on and wants me to be a peak performance at all times.\"\n\n\"Just to share the ring with guys like Brock [Lesnar], [Samoa] Joe and [Roman] Reigns. They have all been doing this a lot longer than I have. They have been around the world and done it all.

I don't know what does. ...Everyone can look forward to me holding the Universal Championship over my head at the end of it.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-15T00:29:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "00:29:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 1}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 1}, {"id": "345418", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Big Show"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Show", "score": 4}, {"id": "365537", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vince McMahon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon", "score": 4}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 4}, {"id": "1327894", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "TV Insider"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Insider", "score": 4}], "image": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/AOPqGGemLNs/mqdefault.jpg", "timeCrawl": "00:29:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Braun Strowman On Relationship With Vince McMahon, Fatal 4-Way At SummerSlam, Working With Big Show - WrestlingInc.com", "originalArticle": null}

The card is filled with the WWE's premier talent in matches that have a big-fight feel.\n\nBrock Lesnar will put his WWE Universal Championship on the line in a Fatal 4-Way main event against Samoa Joe, Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman. \"The Beast Incarnate\" is a big favorite in the match, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com, with Lesnar being pegged at -320 (bet $320 to win $100).\n\nLesnar looks to be near unstoppable at the moment, and the added storyline that he and advocate Paul Heyman will leave the WWE should he lose seems to allude to the champion standing tall Sunday.\n\nThat being said, this would be an excellent excuse to write Lesnar off TV for some time and make a big return heading into Wrestlemania. Plus, Lesnar would never need to be pinned in order to lose the belt, which is a good way to get the title off him without him looking weak.\n\nJoe has the second-best betting odds but still sits far behind Lesnar at +300 (bet $100 to win $300). This Fatal 4-Way is comprised of two intersecting storylines, with Joe and Lesnar being locked in a battle with one another. If anyone were to take the strap off Lesnar, it would make the most sense for it to be Joe.\n\nOver on Smackdown, the WWE Championship will be up for grabs when Jinder Mahal and Shinsuke Nakamura clash. Nakamura sits as a hefty -475 betting favorite to claim his first taste of gold on the main roster.\n\nThis match ending seems to be pretty predictable for bettors. Nakaurma is one of the hottest superstars in the company, and crowning him at one of the biggest shows of the year is a perfect moment that the WWE loves. The ending got even more probable after Baron Corbin unsuccessfully cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase on Smackdown this past week.\n\nBettors will also want to keep an eye on Alexa Bliss vs. Sasha Banks. The betting line originally opened with both women at -120 but has moved to Banks as a sizable -290 favorite.\n\nBanks enters SummerSlam red-hot and, much like Nakamura, seeing her claim gold at a big event might be too good to pass up. However, Bliss is a compelling champion, and seeing Banks lose could help propel her to the heel turn for which so many people are calling.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T14:54:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "14:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "309765", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Narrative thread"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_thread", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 4}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 2}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 5}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 2}, {"id": "339509", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pin (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 2}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 3}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 3}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 3}, {"id": "374391", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman", "score": 3}, {"id": "378643", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam (2013)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam", "score": 4}, {"id": "386419", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mercedes KV"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_KV", "score": 1}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 2}, {"id": "556815", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Fatal 4-Way"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Fatal_4-Way", "score": 4}, {"id": "684004", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Money in the Bank ladder match"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_ladder_match", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}, {"id": "1273434", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Alexa Bliss"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Bliss", "score": 1}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 2}], "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/690/037/hi-res-6f73bddffff89c7d28f77cf9e1d02343_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "timeCrawl": "21:41:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "2017 WWE SummerSlam Odds and Preview: Brock Lesnar Betting Favorite", "originalArticle": null}

Both the Raw and Smackdown rosters will compete in this gigantic event boasting a ton of matches, including a couple with hilarious/awesome stipulations. Summerslam returns to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York on Sunday, August 20. The Kickoff show begins at 5 PM ET/2 PM PT, with the main card starting at 7 PM ET/4 PM PT. Here are the details on the 12 matches taking place during the event.\n\nAs of the time of this writing, there's been no indication of which matches will be on the Kickoff show.\n\nIt's the battle of the Bigs! Enzo Amore and Big Cass are no longer a tag team, and Enzo found a new giant in his life, the Big Show. The two big men will go at it, with Enzo hanging above the ring in a shark cage because over the past year, WWE has enjoyed locking people in cages: Enzo Amore, Chris Jericho, and Paul Ellering. Having someone charismatic or eccentric hanging above the ring inside a shark cage always adds a new level of entertainment to a match.\n\nSince the split between Cass and Enzo, the push seems to be more on Cass than anything else. It feels like Enzo has to have someone bigger than him to fight his battles, and let's be honest, this is all just a move to separate Cass and Enzo to legitimize Cass's solo career. I'm giving the win to Cass.\n\nNeville continues to prove why he's the king of the cruiserweights, but he has a tough task ahead of him as he takes on Akria Tozawa. During a recent episode of Raw, Tozawa won the title from Neville, so Summerslam will be their rematch.\n\n205 Live and the cruiserweight division don't have the audience attention that WWE wants, but it's hard to deny that the talent's PPV matches have been some of the best at each event. This match won't be any different, and while Neville has been a dominant champion, it's time for someone else to have a run. I'm giving the win to Tozawa.\n\nYou can't have a major PPV without John Cena, right? The unseeable man takes on the former Money in the Bank contract winner Baron Corbin for Summerslam. They both want to be WWE Champion, but apparently, they have to fight each other first.\n\nCorbin lost his contract stating he can face the champion any time he wants, so he really needs to win this fight if he wants to get another shot. However, he's up against John Cena, and he's unbeatable at major PPVs.\n\nDean Ambrose and Seth Rollins are a team once again, after each star had their run-ins with the Raw tag team champions. It's been a slow road to get to this point, but fans should be pleased. The only confusing part about this is that they're getting a chance to win the titles so quickly.\n\nThis was one of the final matches added to the already stacked card for Summerslam, and because of that, I don't think there's going to be a title change here. There may be a lot of people excited for two-thirds of the Shield reuniting, but there aren't enough people behind this angle to make a title change worth it.\n\nSmackdown stars Randy Orton and Rusev don't have much to do at this PPV, especially since Jinder Mahal bested Orton numerous times over the past few months, so now, they're going to fight each other. There isn't a lot to dig into with this storyline since it's new and feels a bit forced.\n\nBoth of these stars have been on the losing end of the stick in their past storylines. Orton lost the title and his rematches to Mahal, and Rusev lost his Battleground Flag Match to John Cena. As much as I'm pulling for Rusev, I think Orton will come out on top, driving Rusev further down the spiral of frustration and insanity.\n\nRaw's under utilized and under-appreciated talent is squaring-off at Summerslam. The two have been involved in their current storyline for the past month, and Wyatt wants to prove that Balor isn't what he used to be before he got injured. Now, after Wyatt dumped a bunch of blood on his PPV opponent, Balor has stated his alter-ego The Demon will make an appearance.\n\nThis match has the potential to be a barn burner. Sadly, it's a bit overshadowed by this incredibly stacked card. Either way, it doesn't matter who wins this match because both of the stars are fan favorites and have a ton of talent. Regardless, I have to pick a winner, so I'm going with Finn Balor because The Demon is returning.\n\nOn a recent episode of Raw, Sasha Banks beat Nia Jax to become the number one contender for the Raw Women's Championship. Now, the two will battle at Summerslam in what should be an incredible match.\n\nSasha Banks is a phenomenal performer and one of my favorites on Raw. However, there is a much larger part of me that wants to see Bliss face Jax for the title at a future event, and because of this, I'm giving the win to Bliss. Yes, this is all based on what match I want to see in the future.\n\nNaomi has proven to be a dominant champion; however, she'll be taking on Natalya, who beat five other stars at Battleground to earn the right for the championship match.\n\nWhen it comes to the women on Smackdown, there is a lot of talent and potential for great champions, and while Natalya is a a dominating force with a ton of experience, she won't win this one. I feel like Naomi is on another level right now, and the Queen of Harts won't win this battle. Personally, I'd love to see Naomi take on Becky Lynch or Asuka for the championship.\n\nThe New Day and Usos rivalry continues into SummerSlam. These two teams are the tag team division currently, since Breezango is busy solving mysteries and feuding with Arn Anderson. We're going to get an entertaining match between two fantastic teams that are at the top of their game here, and that's all that matters.\n\nAs much as I want to see the New Day come out on top, The Usos have been fantastic tag team champions, and I'd like to see this storyline continue, and Jimmy and Jey need to win in order for that to happen.\n\nThe United States Championship has been passed back and forth between AJ Styles and Kevin Owens the past month, and each time, there have been shenanigans on the refereeing side of things. In order to keep things fair and honest, Smackdown General Manager Shane McMahon will be calling the match.\n\nEverything about this match seems set up in AJ's favor. Sure, he and Shane had a match against each other earlier this year, but it seems like something is going to swing in favor for Kevin Owens. Because of this, I'm giving the win to KO.\n\nShinsuke Nakamura beat John Cena for the right to take on Jinder Mahal at Summerslam. This PPV marks the start of their battle against each other, assuming this rivalry continues after the match.\n\nWe have two fighters with two very different styles of fighting, so this will be an interesting one to watch. However, after Mahal beat Orton time and time again, he still needs to be established as a fighting champion, and because of this, I think Mahal is going to end up retaining his title.\n\nClosing the evening is Raw's top talent taking on Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship. Samoa Joe and Lesnar already have a history and Roman Reigns, and Braun Strowman almost killed each other at the last Raw PPV. That being said, this is going to be a brutal match to watch.\n\nThis is the only match of the evening where I could see the decision going to any of the competitors. However, for the sake of what I'd like to see, I'm giving the win to Samoa Joe because I want a fighting champion, not just someone who feels part-time. In addition, I want Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman to keep their rivalry going because it's the closest thing we've ever gotten to a live-action Looney Tunes.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T17:05:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 378, "textStart": 369, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "17:05:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [], "image": "https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3271940-s1.jpg?w=240", "timeCrawl": "17:05:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "WWE Summerslam Match Card & Predictions", "originalArticle": null}

The impact Samoa Joe has made ever since debuting in the WWE main roster has been huge and a big part of the 'legend' of Samoa Joe growing in the company and among the fans, was him standing toe-to-toe with the Beast Incarnate Brock Lesnar himself.\n\nA legitimate superstar before he joined WWE, Joe has taken little time in WWE making fans believe in him and after a stellar 'Great Balls of Fire' main event with Lesnar, Joe finds himself in the middle of one of the biggest matches in SummeSlam history - a fatal-four way for the Universal Champion against champion Lesnar, Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman. And on top of that, Joe walks in to his first SummerSlam as the outright favourite to dethrone the Beast Incarnate.\n\nAhead of the mega-event, Joe talked about the big opportunity, his match with Lesnar at GBOF and Wrestlemania.\n\nAim at SummerSlam:\n\nThe sole goal is to go in there and walk out with the championship gold. I will be aiming to do that at SummerSlam. I don't see myself not walking out of SummerSlam as the universal champion. Universal Championship is my focus and I plan on having it. In the long term, I will hold to the champions as long as possible. I have a build on career holding record title reigns and I will do it here as well.\n\nAbout his opponents:\n\nIt is like asking what kind of poison you want to have for dinner. Each one have their own attributes and issues. But the biggest thing for me is to keep my head on a swivel and be aware. The most dangerous will obviously be Brock, the champion, and we have unfinished business as well.\n\nWhen you have so many forces of the nature in the ring, sometimes you have ride up the storm and see them collide and take the opportunity. I did that in fatal-five way; I am smarter than the other guys in the ring.\n\nOn facing Brock Lesnar at Great Balls of Fire Great balls:\n\nAside from the result, it was every bit the physical match that I expected it to be. Brock is one of those special athletes and the stakes and what happens in the ring is elevated in his presence. I consider myself an intense individual, and I have no qualms to say he lived up to his hype as a very intense individual and it was fierce. I think the match lived up to the expectations.\n\nOn being booked as a legitimate threat to Lensar's title:\n\nIt was because Brock sees it that way. He sees me as capable enough and someone who can get it done in the ring. It is a false assumption that he is really tone-deaf to the rest of the world, but he really is one of the most savvy businessmen in our industry, if not all of combat sports. He knew what he was getting into and he understood the magnitude and what kind of threat I presented to him. Him being convinced lend more fire and hype leading up to the match.\n\nExpectations from Wrestlemania 34:\n\nWhen it comes to Wrestlemania I will take whatever opportunity that comes to me. I would love to take on somebody like Brock, Roman, Seth (Rollins), Dean (Ambrose) (Finn) Balor, (AJ) Styles, (John) Cena, the list is endless. you put anyone of them in front of me and I will be good to go.\n\nBiggest change coming in to WWE:\n\nThe scale of everything here is amped up to the 10h power. The production here is top notch and it is the job that they do week after week which is astonishing. They raise the stakes when it comes to big matches.\n\nDream match:\n\nI think talking about dream match, when we just scratch the surface and what is out there right now, Cena, Orton, Balor, Styles - these are guys I have been in ring with before and then there are guys I know we can get in to the ring together and can get the lights outs. it is easier at this point in time to say who isn't a dream match rather than who is, because there are so many guys I have not crossed path with. It is an open question and kind of hard to answer.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T15:52:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.658823549747467, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "15:52:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 5}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 3}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 5}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 3}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 3}, {"id": "420594", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Great Balls of Fire"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Balls_of_Fire", "score": 4}, {"id": "827549", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam (1988)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam_(1988)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}], "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60121898/60121898.jpg?65283", "timeCrawl": "15:52:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Samoa Joe talks highly of Brock Lesnar - Times of India", "originalArticle": null}

For the third straight year, WWE's second-biggest show will rock the house in Brooklyn.\n\nWrestleMania has become WWE's Super Bowl, the mainstream event that brings in casual fans from around the globe. But SummerSlam is the event for the fans, the ones who obsess over matchups and storylines and the like. And this year's card is shaping up to be a great one.\n\nIn the main event, we have four monsters who are set to tear the arena apart in pursuit of the WWE Universal Championship, the top title on the \"Monday Night Raw\" brand. Brock Lesnar, the reigning, defending, undisputed champion, will put his title on the line against Roman Reigns (the face of WWE today), Braun Strowman (the 385-pound Monster Among Men), and Samoa Joe (the man who nearly captured the title from Lesnar in July) in a Fatal Four Way match.\n\nOn the \"SmackDown Live\" brand, WWE Champion Jinder Mahal will defend his belt against Shinsuke Nakamura, the Japanese sensation who has captivated audiences with his charisma and unique fighting style. Jinder has barely escaped his previous title defenses in narrow victories thanks to the Singh Brothers, who always seem to show up and interfere right when Jinder is on the ropes.\n\nElsewhere on the card, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins have finally reunited. The former Shield brothers will attempt to wrestle the Raw Tag Team Championship away from Cesaro and Sheamus. AJ Styles will defend the WWE United States Championship against Kevin Owens with Shane McMahon as the special guest referee. And last but by no means least, we have a pair of women's matches, as Alexa Bliss defends the Raw Women's Championship against Sasha Banks, and Naomi puts the SmackDown Women's Championship on the line against Natalya.\n\nThe 13-match card is stacked, and WWE is making it available free of charge to anyone who signs up for a free trial month of the WWE Network.\n\nAnd on top of NXT Takeover: Brooklyn and SummerSlam this weekend, fans can get immediate access to more than 8,000 hours of WWE content, including classic episodes of \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"SmackDown,\" every pay-per-view in WWE history, and even shows from other promotions such as WCW and ECW.\n\nIf you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

Making a choice between these 6 matches will not be easy.\n\nIf WWE really wants to start the show hot, they could immediately go for the tag championship match featuring Ambrose and Rollins. My main hesitancy with choosing this match for Segment 1 is that there is definitely material here for a dedicated video package, and this match might be needed later on to keep the crowd invested during an event that is way too long.\n\nI think Corbin's cash-in failure opens up the possiblity that he could actually open the show with a quick and decisive loss to John Cena, to really hammer home the point that Corbin is a loser and that Cena is ready for newer challenges on Raw.\n\nThere are a couple other decent choices in there, but ultimately I am going to settle on the return of the Demon King for the opening match. The return of the Demon King would be a cool way to start the show and get the crowd hot for a match that could otherwise be lost in the shuffle if it took place later on in the night.\n\nFor the second straight year the WWE Championship match at SummerSlam feels pretty lackluster, and I don't think WWE needs to put a cool-down match in between the WWE Championship match and the Universal Championship match. I am very comfortable ending the show with those matches running back-to-back, and so I'm putting Mahal's match in Segment 9.\n\nOn a typical WWE PPV that includes 7 or 8 matches, Segment 2 is usually reserved for one of the shortest or least important matches of the night. It's harder to say whether or not that is also the case for a PPV with 10 matches; ultimately I think there's a good chance that Segment 2 or 3 will be used for a lesser match before a more prominent bout is pulled out right after that.\n\nNaomi or Big Show seem to fit the bill for a quicker match in Segment 2. I'll choose Naomi's match for that slot, creating more distance between the two women's championship matches.\n\nWhile Balor and Naomi's matches could both include some very memorable moments, I think at this point the card needs one of the juicier matches of the night to bridge the first two hours. That means either the Ambrose tag match or KO's match could wind up in Segment 3. I'll choose AJ and KO to run early in the night because the feud has been a little underwhelming; the Ambrose match feels like a more appropriate choice for a segment in the latter half of the card.\n\nAt this point I am just going to take the lazy approach of alternating Raw and SmackDown matches the rest of the way because it at least puts in place some kind of logic, as opposed to just random guessing.\n\nAJ and KO could have a really long match, so I'll follow it up with a short match between Big Show and Big Cass in Segment 4.\n\nI'll use Segment 5 for a SmackDown match, and it seems wrong to put Orton's match later in the night than Cena's match. Therefore I'll put Orton in Segment 5, with Cena in Segment 7.\n\nThe final two Raw matches I have left are Alexa's match and the tag team championship match. I'll just choose the simple method of slotting the more important match later in the night, so that means Alexa gets Segment 6 while Ambrose gets Segment 8.\n\nFinalized card\n\nSo here is my final prediction for the match order at SummerSlam, along with guesses on the bell-to-bell match times.\n\nSegment 1: Finn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt (13 minutes)\n\nSegment 2: Naomi vs. Natalya (10)\n\nSegment 3: AJ Styles vs. Kevin Owens (18)\n\nSegment 4: Big Show vs. Big Cass (8)\n\nSegment 5: Randy Orton vs. Rusev (14)\n\nSegment 6: Alexa Bliss vs. Sasha Banks (12)\n\nSegment 7: John Cena vs. Baron Corbin (13)\n\nSegment 8: Cesaro & Sheamus vs. Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins (15)\n\nSegment 9: Jinder Mahal vs. Shinsuke Nakamura (16)\n\nSegment 10: Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman vs. Samoa Joe (15)\n\nThese predicted times add up to 134 minutes, which is more match time than a typical 4-hour WWE PPV contains.

Furthermore, I hope that Sunday is the last night he ever walks down the aisle with the WWE Championship belt in his possession. His entire reign has been little short of a farce. I cannot remember a champion being so wholly unready, unqualified, or undeserving of a title reign. Let's not forget that Jinder's run was basically a publicity stunt. Vince McMahon and WWE corporate decided that it would beneficial for their Indian expansion to have a Superstar of Indian heritage be champion when they toured there. Since Jinder was the only person who fit that description, it had to be him. Forget that he was little more than a jobber less than a month prior to winning to the title. It mattered not that he is not very good in the ring or on the mic. I can almost hear Vince saying \"G----mit, he's Indian we've got to make him champion\". Smackdown creative was stuck. They had no idea what to do with Jinder hence the trite and terrible generic foreign heel gimmick. The last guy who really got over as a foreign heel was Yokozuna and that was due, in large part, to his size. Jinder was given the Singh brothers because he wasn't a believable threat by himself, not shocking considering he was losing matches to Mojo Rawley less than a month earlier. Week after week he's given the same anti-American promo and not gotten any better at it. With these terrible promos and mediocre in-ring work, he's single-handedly dragged Smackdown down. The WWE Championship is the cornerstone of the show so when your champion is somebody nobody wants to see that's a problem. Randy Orton was never going to win the title back from Jinder. That would have been like admitting a mistake had been made. No, instead we the audience were subjected to three months of Orton and Mahal feuding with Randy doing job after job to make Jinder look good culminating with the predictably awful Punjabi Prison match. Jinder still doesn't look any better but the Punjabi Prison match still happened. With that rivalry behind us, Jinder is now vulnerable. The India tour is done. He beat Randy Orton three straight times. There is absolutely no justifiable reason to keep the belt on him. Is it too soon for Shinsuke Nakamura? Perhaps but right now he is our only hope. He's great in the ring. He's got star power and he's championship caliber. He did win the NXT Championship five months into his tenure there so there's precedent. More importantly though it's necessary. The terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad title reign of Jinder Mahal must end and it must end Sunday.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T04:41:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 27, "textStart": 12, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "04:41:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "324362", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian_and_person_of_Indian_origin", "score": 3}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 2}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 5}, {"id": "333978", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Job (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 5}, {"id": "351140", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "365537", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vince McMahon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon", "score": 5}, {"id": "378642", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Randy Orton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton", "score": 2}, {"id": "388247", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mojo Rawley"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_Rawley", "score": 2}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 4}, {"id": "445970", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Yokozuna (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokozuna_(wrestler)", "score": 3}, {"id": "705040", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Royal Rumble (2009)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble_(2009)", "score": 4}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/blog/sbnu_logo_minimal/244/large_cagesideseats.com.minimal.png", "timeCrawl": "04:54:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "The End of the Nightmare", "originalArticle": null}

WWE officials made many roster moves to bring fresh storylines to Raw and SmackDown Live. However, it seems the powers that be are planning to shake things up again shortly after 'Summerslam' and there have been rumors about another \"Superstar Shakeup\" happening.\n\nEven before the grandest stage of them all, there was a lot of speculation that AJ Styles would be moving to Raw this year. Another \"Shakeup\" is still unconfirmed, but some names have dropped as potential stars to switch brands after WWE Summerslam. It's been reported that AJ Styles, Jinder Mahal, and The Usos are the likely names to move to Raw while Sasha Banks, Finn Balor, and others may move to \"the blue brand.\"\n\nApparently, Randy Orton has also been rumored for a brand switch, which would be a huge change of pace from the way WWE officials wanted to book The Viper after WrestleMania 33. Before John Cena's return, the powers that be were rumored to be giving Orton a \"Roman Reigns\" push and feature him as the face of SmackDown Live. However, those plans were before he dropped the WWE Championship to Jinder Mahal.\n\nHeading into WWE Summerslam, Randy Orton is involved in a mid-card feud with Rusev. It is a fresh feud, but it's a mid-card match on an overloaded card. Their match isn't expected to steal the show, but it could be a good last stand for The Viper to put over The Bulgarian Brute before he's sent to Monday Night Raw for a top spot on WWE's flagship show. On Raw, Orton could do a lot of good work with plenty of fresh faces.\n\nAs of this writing, any plans for another \"Superstar Shakeup\" have yet to be confirmed. However, The Viper would be a top choice to make the jump from SmackDown Live to Raw. Orton has already been the WWE Champion this year. On \"the blue brand,\" he's likely to float around the mid-card for quite some time, but a lot more opportunities may happen for him on Raw depending on how many other roster moves are made.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T06:31:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "06:31:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

We're less than two days away from \"Summerslam 2017\" and there are a staggering thirteen matches on the card. I know three of them are going to be on the Kickoff Show but sweet goodness that's a lot of wrestling in one night. The card has grown on me in recent weeks and I'm more excited about it than I used to be so hopefully it's going to be good. Let's get to it.\n\nKickoff Show: Hardy Boyz/Jason Jordan vs. Miz/Miztourage\n\nI'll take the Hardys and Jordan to win, likely with Jordan pinning Miz to set up a future Intercontinental Title match (it wouldn't surprise me if it was as soon as the following night's TV). Jordan hasn't exactly been thrilling in his singles run (but hey, at least it wasn't the predictable choice of Chad Gable, because surprising people is better than going with the right move) but putting him with the Hardys is a good idea. That being said, the fact that Jordan needs support less than a month into the new run.\n\nKickoff Show: Smackdown Tag Team Titles: New Day(c) vs. Usos\n\nThis is the third match in their trilogy and the previous two have both been quite entertaining. I'm not sure why this feud is continuing (well outside of having no one else to go after the titles) but it makes sense to get someone as popular as New Day on the show. The might not be as big as they used to be but the merchandise sales alone validate keeping them around.\n\nI think New Day retains here as there's no reason to put them back on the Usos. Unless Breezango suddenly wraps up their story and moves on to the title picture again (like they probably should), there's no major face team for the Usos to fight. Hopefully this wraps up the feud though as there's no reason to keep this going, especially if some new teams could be put together out of necessity.\n\nCruiserweight Title: Akira Tozawa(c) vs. Neville\n\nSpeaking of matches we've seen recently. Tozawa won the title just six days before the pay per view and Neville has already shown signs of unraveling from the loss. My guess is we'll be seeing another hard hitting, entertaining match but the question is whether or not this is the ending of the story.\n\nTozawa should retain here and I think he likely will, sending him forward to have some fresh matches for the title. The problem with Neville as champion was that he was so awesome that he prevented a lot of wrestlers from being realistic challengers. That's not the case with Tozawa, who is still good but feels like someone who the masses could threaten. This should be entertaining, though it needs to wrap up the feud already.\n\nCheck out how losing the title has rocked Neville:\n\nNeville interrupts Akira Tozawa's championship celebration: WWE 205 Live, Aug. 15, 2017\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev\n\nWe'll start the main card with a match that I don't think anyone is actively looking forward to. This is a great example of a match where it feels like both guys are thrown into the match due to a lack of anything else for either of them to do, plus a need to get them onto the card. That's going to happen on almost every show but it feels like it's happening multiple times on this particular show.\n\nI'll actually take Rusev to win the battle of losers of last month's terrible gimmick matches. Orton has the RKO and that's really all he needs to bounce back. Rusev on the other hand still needs some extra support to get higher up the card and a win over Orton would help him along the way. Then again never underestimate the amount of time and effort WWE will put into Orton. It actually goes somewhere in his case but it gets a little tiring after awhile.\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass\n\nEnzo Amore, who is apparently scared of heights, will be hanging in a cage over the ring and the word on the street is that it's due to a punishment for him being so annoying backstage. As someone with a similar fear, allow me to say SCREW OFF WWE. Now that the personal bias is out of the way, let's get down to the problem with this feud: we've established that Amore isn't a threat to Big Cass but the feud is continuing anyway. Big Cass needs to move on to something else and hopefully this wraps up the feud once and for all.\n\nIf it's not clear, I'm taking Big Cass to win here. Unfortunately I could imagine them getting there by having Big Show turn on Amore after the match for the sake of mentoring Big Cass. That story seems played out, which is why WWE is even more likely to go with it. As long as it gets Big Cass away from Amore though, things will be picking up in a hurry. Big Cass wins, as he should be doing.\n\nSmackdown Women's Title: Naomi(c) vs. Natalya\n\nThis is a thing that exists as well. The match has next to no heat and it's clear that Natalya isn't an interesting challenger. I have no idea why Naomi, who has turned into a much better champion than I was expecting, is stuck fighting her while Becky Lynch and Charlotte are both on the roster. Either of them would offer ten times the match on their worst day but for some reason we're getting Natalya.\n\nI'll go with Naomi to retain, though I don't think they'll do the Money in the Bank cash-in. They've been teasing it far too much lately and as a rule, that means we won't be seeing it just yet. Naomi needs better challengers and until we get to Lynch or Charlotte, that's just not going to be the case. If nothing else give us Carmella, who has some charisma and personality to her, neither of which Natalya has ever been able to claim.\n\nUS Title: AJ Styles(c) vs. Kevin Owens\n\nShane McMahon is guest referee and somehow this seems to be a way to set up Owens vs. McMahon down the line. Styles and Owens have been feuding for months now and they haven't quite gotten up to the top level that I think we all believe they're capable of reaching. I have a feeling this is going to be the match where they do it, though the time issues might cause them some issues.\n\nI think Styles retains, likely due to some kind of shenanigans with McMahon. Odds are we'll be seeing those two fighting in the near future, which doesn't do much for me though I've calmed down a bit on my dislike of McMahon getting in the ring. Styles retaining and fighting various challengers over the next few months is a great way to set him up for another World Title push and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nHere's how McMahon has gotten more involved in the match than he should have:\n\nAJ Styles apologizes to Shane McMahon: SmackDown LIVE, Aug. 15, 2017\n\nRaw Tag Team Titles: Sheamus/Cesaro(c) vs. Seth Rollins/Dean Ambrose\n\nThis has somehow turned into one of the biggest stories on the show with Ambrose and Rollins finally reuniting for the first time in a few years. That granted them an immediate shot at the titles, which actually works for a change. I can live with the idea of two former World Champions with a strong history together being pushed as a top team in such a hurry, especially two as over as these guys.\n\nAmbrose and Rollins should get the belts here with the only possible reason not to go that way being a potential singles feud between the two. I don't think WWE would set them up like this for the sake of splitting them again this fast, but you can never give WWE that much credit. Sheamus and Cesaro never felt like long term champions anyway so Ambrose and Rollins getting the belts would be the best move, if nothing else just for some fresh blood.\n\nOne of the best moments WWE has put together all year:\n\nDean Ambrose and Seth Rollins have reunited and it was awesome\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nThis match took on a new life this past week when Cena cost Corbin his Money in the Bank cash-in attempt. When you also factor in Cena pretty certainly leaving for \"Monday Night Raw\" as soon as this show is over, it should make for an obvious ending. That being said, never underestimate WWE's ability to do something overly stupid.\n\nI'll go with Corbin getting the biggest win of his career but Cena just lost a clean fall to Shinsuke Nakamura a few weeks back and WWE probably isn't too gung ho about having him lose so soon again. Corbin needs to win this one far more than Cena (who could go his whole career without ever winning another big match) as he looked like a moron earlier this week.\n\nRaw Women's Title: Alexa Bliss(c) vs. Sasha Banks\n\nNow this one depends on how you look at it. If you're looking at the long term story, you go with Banks winning the title for the sake of building towards Banks vs. Bayley for the title at \"Wrestlemania XXXIV\". If you want to go short term, you have Banks win the title for the sake of Bliss running out of potential opponents.\n\nSo yeah, this is all about Banks winning the title and I see next to no reason for Bliss to retain. She's defended against most of the important women on the \"Monday Night Raw\" roster (yes I know that means all of two people) and there's no reason to have her hold the title much longer. That's the danger of such a thin division: you're only going to get so far with so few people on top, especially when one of them is injured.\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\nWe've seen this one already but now there's a bit of a twist. After Wyatt defeated Balor earlier this week, Balor promised to bring the Demon King back on Sunday. Why WWE went this straightforward with the idea instead of letting it be a surprise isn't clear, but my guess would be that they didn't think its fans were smart enough to put the idea together for themselves.\n\nOf course I'm going with Balor, as you don't bring out the Demon King character for only the second time ever on the main roster and then have him lose. Besides, Wyatt has won his last few big matches and that means it's time to rip the carpet out from underneath him and turn him back into a choker all over again. Balor wins, as he should, though it should be in the first match between the two of them instead of the rematch.\n\nWhat's the Demon King you ask? Balor has you covered.\n\nFinn B\u00e1lor reveals the history of The Demon King: Raw, Aug. 8, 2016\n\nSmackdown World Title: Jinder Mahal(c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nI know this is supposed to be one of the biggest layups on the show but it seems that WWE is pushing it a bit too hard as the big layup. Nakamura seems to be ready to win the title but I could see WWE letting Mahal keep it just a little longer for the sake of a surprise. Nakamura hasn't exactly lit the world on fire since he came up to the main roster but at least he would be a change of pace.\n\nI'll go with Nakamura winning the title as Mahal just isn't working as champion. He's held the title for three months but his biggest issue continues to be the firm ceiling he's stuck underneath. On his best day, Mahal is little more than average either on the microphone or in the ring. Nakamura might not have been the best in the world so far, but he's a lot better than Mahal no matter how you look at it.\n\nUniversal Title: Brock Lesnar(c) vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman vs. Roman Reigns\n\nAnd then, there's this, which is what the show is almost entirely built around. If they let these four go nuts and tear the house down, there's a good chance that this will be one of the best matches of the year. These four have some amazing energy and chemistry together in any form and the idea of getting rid of Lesnar no matter how he loses the title is a great incentive. Now the question is where you think this is going.\n\nI'll go with Strowman winning the title, with the eventual goal of Reigns facing Lesnar in the main event of \"Wrestlemania XXXIV\". Lesnar can come back at the Royal Rumble (perhaps winning the thing) and get the shot at Reigns (who can be champion by that point) with Reigns winning the one on one match to dispatch Lesnar once and for all. I could see Samoa Joe winning as well, but I'll go with Strowman here, as he's been built up very, very well.\n\nSo that's going to be \"Summerslam 2017\" and sweet goodness there's a lot of stuff to get through. It's almost tiring to just look at the whole card but hopefully that doesn't become a problem tomorrow night. The key to the whole thing is going to be how well they pace the thing, though there's only so much you can do with this many matches in one night. There's a lot of potential though and if they can live up to it, everything is going to be great.\n\nRemember to check out my website at kbwrestlingreviews.com, follow me on Twitter @kbreviews and pick up the Complete 2002 Monday Night Raw Reviews in either E-Book or Paperback.

He tweets here: @kevinjameswong.\n\nWWE's main event storylines, despite their twists and turns, have a moral, ethical center.\n\nThe heels will ultimately get their comeuppance. The faces will overcome adversity. And typically, the good guys will surmount that adversity on the biggest stage possible to maximize its impact. It's why WWE's creative team has emphasized and touted the company's \"WrestleMania moments\" in recent years. They celebrate Shawn Michaels fulfilling his \"boyhood dream\" at WrestleMania 12. They replay Daniel Bryan winning the WWE world heavyweight title at WrestleMania 30. WrestleMania is the place, they say, where mortals, even unlikely mortals, can become legends.\n\nBut for these moments to mean something, the faces have to start as the underdogs, from the bottom of the proverbial ladder, to highlight the struggle it took to reach the top. And in recent years, SummerSlam has represented the bottom of that ladder -- it's the worst night of the year to be a babyface. If WrestleMania is the place where dreams come true, then SummerSlam is the place where dreams go to die.\n\nHeels win the main event at SummerSlam. It's an unwritten rule, with few exceptions. And even when they don't win, the babyfaces will still get screwed over, somehow. Daniel Bryan beat John Cena in 2013's main event, but then Randy Orton cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase on Bryan right afterwards, pinning him in under a minute. The same sort of thing happened to CM Punk in 2011's main event; he beat John Cena, but before the show went off the air, Alberto del Rio cashed in his Money in the Bank to steal the title.\n\nAnd speaking of John Cena, the eternal babyface of WWE has a glaringly lopsided, losing record at SummerSlam. The last time he won a singles match at the pay-per-view was in 2007, when he beat Randy Orton to retain the WWE title. He lost to Batista in 2008. He lost to Orton in 2009. He won a multi-man tag match in 2010, he led his WWE team to victory over upstart stable the Nexus. According to Chris Jericho and Edge, however, Cena might have been originally booked to lose this one as well; he used his backstage clout to flip the result. Former Nexus members Ryback and Justin Gabriel have confirmed as much in subsequent interviews.\n\nAnd since then (karma perhaps?) Cena has been on a six match losing streak at SummerSlam. He lost to CM Punk in 2011. Then again to Punk in 2012. Then to Bryan in 2013. Then to Lesnar in 2014. Then to Seth Rollins in 2015. Then to AJ Styles in 2016.\n\nAnd the striking thing about these losses is that with the exception of the Rollins loss (which featured Jon Stewart with a steel chair), every one of these losses was a clean loss, with a clean pin in the center of the ring. Cena's match versus Lesnar in 2014 wasn't even competitive; Cena took 16 German suplexes to the back of his head and was never in full control of the match, even once.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhich is to say that this year, Cena will be losing again, this time to Baron Corbin. On this Tuesday's SmackDown, Corbin lost his Money in the Bank briefcase thanks to Cena's interference. And unless WWE Creative has decided to completely bury its young, upcoming superstar, this cannot go unaddressed. Cena might not lose in the literal sense; he may walk away with a DQ win, depending on how brutal Corbin decides to get. But he's certainly going to end the evening flat on his back, one way or the other.\n\nThere are currently two world titles in contention at SummerSlam: the WWE championship and the WWE universal title. The match for the former, which pits Jinder Mahal against Shinsuke Nakamura, will be the most prominent babyface win of the evening. And that's mostly by necessity. The Mahal experiment, where WWE creative tried to remake a complete jobber into a bona-fide champion, has failed; years from now, it'll be embarrassing to see Mahal's name alongside Bruno Sammartino's, Hulk Hogan's, and The Rock's. Nakamura, on the other hand, is completely over with the fans, and is more flexible to work with. Mahal is one-note and has one compelling storyline -- the evil minority with a victim complex. Nakamura is also an ethnic minority, and he does not make his background his entire identity. If WWE wants to be a truly global company, Nakamura is the key to that perception.\n\nBut Nakamura vs. Mahal will not be the show's main event. It'll either be at the beginning of the PPV or right near the middle of it, where it can build the fans' positive emotions before crashing them back down to earth The main event will be a Fatal 4-Way for the WWE Universal championship between Brock Lesnar, Braun Strowman, Samoa Joe, and Roman Reigns. And because this is SummerSlam, the guy who absolutely no one wants to win? That's the guy who's going to win. Strowman won't win; he's been a smark anti-hero, ever since that extended beatdown segment on Raw, when he tipped over that ambulance with Reigns trapped inside.\n\nReigns isn't winning it. As much as fans boo him, he's also, simultaneously, the biggest merchandise seller in the company. There's a massive, silent majority who love the guy. WWE will continue pushing him as a babyface, and they're not going to set him up for failure in front of a hostile, contrarian Barclays Center crowd. That Shield reunion that everyone is hoping for? Not yet. That'll be the positive \"WrestleMania moment\" months from now.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJoe isn't winning it. He's the second most likely, but he hasn't been properly built up for it, from a narrative standpoint. This past Monday, Joe barely had the chance to talk and get his promo in; Paul Heyman hogged all of the time.\n\nBrock Lesnar is winning it. He's a scripted heel, and he has heat with everyone. The marks hate him. The smarks are sick of him, and wish he would work a full-time schedule. If Vince McMahon wants to troll all the WWE fans, this is the way to do it.\n\nFor Lesnar, SummerSlam is his place of triumph. He won his first WWE title here. His overall record at SummerSlam is 5-2. And he's won and main evented four out his last five matches. For all his talk about leaving WWE if he loses; he's contracted to WWE for the immediate future, and he's advertised to appear at September's No Mercy. Ticket sales have already started.\n\nSo prepare to leave SummerSlam pissed off and unfulfilled, per usual. But don't worry. The Beast Incarnate will get his comeuppance.

Brock Lesnar (c) v Roman Reigns v Samoa Joe v Braun Strowman (WWE Universal Championship)\n\nThere is nothing small or subtle about this match. For its showpiece main event the WWE has taken the old school route and thrown together its four biggest and baddest wrestlers to see who will come out on top.\n\nThe current champion Brock Lesnar will be a name familiar to anyone with even a passing interest in combat sports as a former WWE, UFC and NCAA Wrestling Champion.\n\nIf you haven't seen him in a WWE ring before his general MO is to overpower and rag doll his opponents all around the ring.\n\nHis opposition here are Roman Reigns, the anointed 'next big thing' in the WWE, Samoa Joe, the indy destroyer who has won just about every other championship in wrestling and Braun Strowman, a two metre tall, 150kg former strong man contestant.\n\nThese wrestlers have all put in extremely hard hitting matches against one another over the last few months so expect nothing less than a complete brawl.\n\nThe icing of intrigue on this violent cake is the stipulation that if Brock loses he will leave the WWE, so you can expect to see him gain another level of strength and power as he looks to hold onto his championship and his job.\n\n(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\n2. Sheamus and Cesaro (c) v Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose (Raw Tag Team Championship)\n\nIf you read my column earlier this week about the story arc that has brought Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose to this point you will know I am a pretty big fan of their work.\n\nOver three years they have consistently been a compelling pairing, first against each other and now by each others sides. When they finally bumped their fists together and reunited this week the audience nearly blew the roof off the arena.\n\nTheir opponents Sheamus and Cesaro may have been flung together last year largely because they weren't really doing anything else at the time, but after their less than glorious beginning the pair have grown to become the most physical tag team on Monday Night Raw and the rightful champions of the division.\n\nThe kind of match these four can produce together will be a treat as well. Sheamus and Cesaro are two of the most reliable wrestlers on the roster and Seth and Dean have utterly potent chemistry as opponents and now back together as a team.\n\n3. AJ Styles (c) v Kevin Owens with Shane McMahon as Guest Referee (United States Championship)\n\nOne of the really fantastic things the WWE has done over the last few years is increase the prominence of its second-tier titles, such as the US Championship and the Intercontinental title.\n\nWhile the Intercontinental title won't be defended at Summer Slam, the elevation of these belts will continue with this match pitting two guys who started the year as the World Champion of each of their brands fighting for the US Title.\n\nThe previous matches between Styles and Owens have uncharacteristically lacked something to elevate them to truly memorable matches, but expect them to pull out all stops as they blow off their feud.\n\nJust to add some extra spice, they will be wrestling under the eye of guest referee Shane McMahon, the son of the company owner Vince, who isn't afraid to get involved physically and has tussled with both of these wrestlers previously.\n\n4. Jinder Mahal (c) v Shinsuke Nakamura (WWE World Heavyweight Championship)\n\nThe rise of Jinder Mahal to WWE World Champion has been one of the most controversial affairs in recent wrestling memory, dividing the wrestling fan-base between haters and believers (read more about that in my previous column), but one thing that has united fans back together is Shinsuke Nakamura as number 1 contender.\n\nThe King of Strong Style is like a wrestling mix of Freddy Mercury and Michael Jackson (trust me, it works), a unique showman that has buckets of style and the moves to back it up in the ring.\n\nAsian characters have previously not received the greatest treatment by the WWE, but Nakamura has rightfully had the red carpet rolled out for him since arriving in the company a year ago and won over even the fans that didn't know his history of wrestling in Japan.\n\nWhile there is a chance Mahal will find a way to screw over Nakamura this match may well be the coronation of Nakamura as WWE Champion.\n\n5. The New Day (c) v The Usos (Smackdown Tag Team Championship)\n\nIn the space of four months the Smackdown tag team has gone from near non-existent to one of the most exciting divisions in the WWE, largely off the back of The Uso's and now the New Day's work as Smackdown tag team champs.\n\nSince reinventing their characters as trash talking thugs, the Uso's have been putting in the best work of their career and have clearly inspired a New Day whose act was in danger of going stale.\n\nNot only have they delivered in the ring with matches such as their clinic at the recent WWE Battleground event, but their promo segments such as their July 4 battle rap have regularly been the most entertaining segments on Smackdown.\n\nIt is a crime that this match has been relegated to the pre-show to the main card, but hopefully that will mean these two veteran tag teams will get extra time to put on the tag team master class they are capable of.\n\nSo over to you Roarers, what are you looking forward to most at WWE Summer Slam?", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:23:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 5148, "textStart": 5142, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-04", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373948", "time": "21:23:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "113", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 2}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "309979", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "score": 2}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

This will probably be a win for Cass via Enzo trying to screw him over but probably screwing Big Show instead.\n\n- Two years ago at SummerSlam, Rollins defeated Cena to become the first superstar in WWE history to simultaneously hold the WWE Championship and United States Championship. The storytelling going into this match has focused on the simmering tensions between Styles and McMahon, who had a brutal feud leading up to this year's WrestleMania, even though Styles has since shifted from villain to good guy.\n\nIt should be interesting to see if he appears on television tomorrow night during NXT Takeover: Brooklyn.\n\nTaking a guess that the fan wasn't just a big Baron Corbin fan.\n\nAlso, all the points sign to Lesnar facing Braun Strowman next month. Corbin's track record with matches hasn't been great and this looks like it will largely be more of the same.\n\nMuch in the same ilk of Braun Strowman earlier, Natalya's move would be predicated on the fact that she isn't champion when SummerSlam comes to a close. Much of the build centered around Ms. Money in the Bank Carmella and the possibility of her cashing in the briefcase (hopefully more successfully than Baron Corbin).\n\n- Banks is a three-time champion, but each of her title victories occurred on Monday Night Raw. Does Bayley suddenly turn on Sasha?\n\nStevens and Miller both were anxious about weather hurting the turnout at today's rally but they have other rallies planned for the WWE NXT \"Takeover: Brooklyn III\" event on Saturday and SummerSlam on Sunday. Gothamist reports that the group, led by thirty year-old John Stevens, were outside of the event protesting due to Trump's press conference in which the President said that \"many sides\" were at fault for the Charlottesville violence and said there were \"some very fine people\" on the alt-right side.\n\nAmbrose and Rollins have to win this, especially since Cesaro and Sheamus have run their course as a tag team. Moments later, the champion used the referee to shield himself from the challenger and went for his Rings of Saturn submission hold. He has a character and a personality that WWE can make money off of. Either way, given both teams' experience with tag team wrestling, this should be fun. \"He brings this insane, unique character that I don't think there's been anything like him, but then he just kicks the crap out of you\". It also brought an end to the longest reign so far by anyone from the 205 Live division of Cruiserweights so far.\n\nHonorable Mention: The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) (w/Kofi Kingston) (c) vs. These five men have produced some of the best segments on an otherwise slumping SmackDown show and deserve a better than what they will likely get.

He was there with his WWE championship belt in hand, the result of years of hard work and a never-quit attitude.\n\nFollowing his release in 2013, Dhesi recommitted himself to fitness and clean eating, and pushed himself back onto the WWE's radar. In the summer of 2016, his work paid off. Less than one year later, Mahal became the WWE's 50th heavyweight champion. Since then, Mahal has been successfully defending his championship, been a part of WWE's growth around the world, specifically in the homeland of his parents, India, and emerged as a viable main event player. On Sunday, he'll defend that championship, which he won in May, when he faces Japanese megastar Shinsuke Nakamura.\n\nFor Mahal, the learning curve at the top of the WWE roster has been steep.\n\n\"I get asked a lot, 'Did you celebrate? What was it like?'\" Mahal answered when asked about his reign, which is now at three months and counting. \"Honestly, I didn't have a moment where it was like, 'Oh my god, I accomplished something,'\" he said. \"My goals are a lot bigger than this. I worked very, very hard to get here, but I knew that the hard work was just beginning.\"\n\nBesides an increased presence on TV and at pay-per-views, Mahal has seen his presence within the company grow as well, which has translated into more media interviews, merchandise opportunities and his image on more posters and WWE promotional tools. It's a responsibility, he said, that he takes very seriously.\n\n\"As the WWE champion, you're the face of the company,\" Mahal said. \"I look at things totally differently now. Every live event, I'm asking the marketing rep what the gate was, what the attendance was, what it was last time we were here ... I ask about my merchandise sales... From a business point of view, I'm a lot different. And obviously, the media that I've been doing has increased quite a bit, which I enjoy because ultimately, the more media I do, the bigger my brand becomes and, ultimately, the more value I am to WWE.\"\n\nMahal also seems to have gotten his bad guy character over, as fans everywhere boo him appropriately as a bad guy, rather than as someone who doesn't interest them. Everywhere, that is, except in his homeland of Canada. During appearances in Kingston, and a live TV taping of Smackdown Live in Toronto, Mahal's normal boos were replaced by noticeable ovations, a nation tipping its collective cap to the Canadian-born champ.\n\n\"Toronto was amazing,\" Mahal said. \"It's actually one of my favourite crowds that I've ever performed in front of.\"\n\nThe adulation at the Air Canada Centre wasn't entirely unexpected, Mahal admitted. \"Even Randy (Orton, his opponent in Toronto) knew. A week before, we knew that we were going to have the match and he's like, 'Oh, it's going to be in Toronto, it should be interesting.' I was like, 'Yeah, it will be.' I thought it was going to be like 50/50, but man, we were in the beginning and Randy was punching me and the crowd's booing. It was awesome.\"\n\nMahal admitted the love from Canada made the trip special.\n\n\"I know Canada's very proud. I'm from Calgary, but all of Canada is very proud. Interesting note, Smackdown followed Raw (also in Toronto one night earlier), and I had asked about the attendance, and we weren't that far off from Raw, which is big because sometimes Smackdown is significantly lower.\"\n\nThe significance of being one of the main events at SummerSlam, WWE's second-biggest event of the year next to WrestleMania, isn't lost on the Albertan, who has never competed at a SummerSlam.\n\n\"All the other previously SummerSlams, I've been unfortunately sitting in catering and watching the show and wishing I could be on the show,\" Mahal said. \"But now this is my moment. Not only am I on the card, I'm in a WWE Champoinship match, one of the main events, against someone like Shinsuke Nakamura, who is an international superstar.

Here's why keeping the Universal Championship on him is the smart idea.\n\nBrock Lesnar faces a tall task in Brooklyn on Sunday. The Universal Champion enters WWE SummerSlam with three foes instead of one. Even worse for the champion, he doesn't have to factor into the decision at all to lose his title.\n\nHis advocate, Paul Heyman, has made it clear that if Lesnar does not retain his title, then they are both leaving. Of course, this could very well be a strong indicator that he is indeed going to retain on Sunday.\n\nHowever, this isn't just a matter of keeping the belt on him. There are plenty of justifiable reasons as to why a title change isn't necessary yet. Here are five reasons for making the case for Lesnar to remain Universal Champion.\n\nThe simplest and easiest answer is that it means more Paul Heyman. The beauty of having Heyman as his advocate is that he can progress the story without Lesnar always having to be there.\n\nAs evidenced in the Samoa Joe feud, Heyman did a tremendous job of carrying that feud along himself with his mic work. If Lesnar remains the champ, then Heyman gets to grace the ring with his appearance still.\n\nIn a time where managers aren't prevalent like they used to be, Heyman is the last of an old breed.

Not only are \"firing\" and \"quitting\" storylines hardly ever worth their weight in salt, but Lesnar is advertised for several post-SummerSlam events, including No Mercy, as Sean Rueter of Cageside Seats reported.\n\nHeyman's threat seems to be a direct result of the WWE-UFC rumor mill collapsing into itself following UFC 214, when light heavyweight champion Jon Jones called out The Beast in a post-fight promo that was better suited to WWE.\n\nNot only has WWE used Lesnar-to-UFC rumors to build speculation that its cash cow is potentially quitting, but the company has also fueled the fire through articles like this one on WWE.com, quoting Lesnar's response to his immensely talented mixed martial arts foe.\n\nUFC and WWE's apparent joint-marketing efforts, for a bout that is potentially one year in the making, resurfaced when Jones commented about possibly appearing at SummerSlam.\n\nJones acknowledged via his Twitter account that stopping by WWE SummerSlam did \"cross his mind.\" And guess what? The Tweet was picked up by WWE social media correspondent Cathy Kelley in a recent YouTube clip (h/t Joshua Gagnon of Wrestling Inc). Suspicious much?\n\nSummerSlam, which typically does its best to mimic the pageantry and star power of WrestleMania, has yet to announce a major celebrity appearance.\n\nIn years past, names like Jon Stewart, CeeLo Green, Tito Ortiz and Ronda Rousey have stopped by to soak in the biggest party of the summer. Rousey, incidentally, stands to be the key to WWE offering up Lesnar while under contract, as booking her for a future pay-per-view appearance or match is something of a fair trade.\n\nWWE.com has a photo gallery dedicated to the celebrities who have been involved with pay-per-views. A photo shared by B/R's Jeremy Botter even reveals Jones once stopped by SummerSlam to rub elbows with Lesnar (h/t Anton Tabuena of Bloody Elbow).\n\nShould you be surprised if Jones is sitting ringside during the main event, only for Lesnar to respond to his challenge following a dramatic victory?

Reigns, coming off his win over the iconic Undertaker at WrestleMania, challenges, along with veteran Samoa Joe and beast-like Strowman. A win by Reigns could ignite a riot, as fans continue to reject him as a company face. A win by any of the other three would likely work for fans.\n\nPrediction: Strowman's reign begins. Brock walks.\n\nWWE Championship match: Canadian Mahal defends his title against fan favourite Nakamura. Nakamura's strong style is new to WWE fans but not to wrestling fans as a whole. He gets his first main event spotlight, and quite probably his first title run. The big winner here could be the fans, as major ring entrances are expected for both men.\n\nPrediction: Nakamura scores his first WWE title.\n\nWWE Smackdown Women's Championship match: Calgary's Natalya takes on the women's champ Naomi. Nattie comes in strong, having won by submission over Becky Lynch in her final tuneup. Naomi's light show entrance should be amazing.\n\nPrediction: Nattie scores her first WWE women's championship (she was a Divas champion). The catch here is that Money in the Bank contract holder Carmela could well cash in during or after this match and steal the thunder.\n\nWWE Raw Women's Championship Match: Alexa Bliss defends her title against fan favourite Sasha Banks. Bliss's lengthy title run faces a legitimate threat from Banks, who has regained her health and dominance.\n\nPrediction: Bliss retains.\n\nUnited States Championship Match: Montreal's Kevin Owens challenges AJ Styles for the U.S. title, with special guest referee Shane McMahon. This one is a coin toss, as perfect booking has left us guessing who could come out on top. Well built up hype to this match.\n\nPrediction: Styles retains, with McMahon somehow implicated.\n\nRaw tag-team championship match: Champs Cesaro and Sheamus face the reformed (sorta) Shield in Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose. This should be an excellent match bell to bell. All four are upper-level talents and perform best on the big stage.\n\nPrediction: New champs. WWE knows it can make money with Ambrose and Rollins as a team.\n\nSmackdown tag-team championship match: The New Day defend their titles against the extremely talented Usos. This is an example of tag-team wrestling at its best.\n\nPrediction: Usos win.\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin: Corbin's seeming rise to the stop was stunted by his failed cash-in of his Money in the Bank contract, but a match versus the iconic Cena could provide a better lift anyway.\n\nPrediction: Cena helps showcase Corbin's talents, as Corbin wins clean.\n\nRusev vs. Randy Orton: This one didn't have a lot of build, but should still provide good entertainment. WWE may again trend toward building up Rusev, who is a great talent. What better way to do it than with one of the top guys in the company helping?\n\nPrediction: Rusev wins.\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass with Enzo Amore suspended above the ring in a shark cage: This whole angle has been mediocre at best. Perhaps a strong finish can be had, but if WWE is working to put Big Cass over in singles, it won't start here.\n\nPrediction: Big Cass wins.\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt: This one could be a show stealer. Balor will enter as his demon alter ego, which will be terrific on the big stage. Wyatt is always entertaining. The question is where does this go from here? Both men could use the momentum and push that would come from a win, yet this could go either way.\n\nPrediction: Balor.\n\nAkira Tozawa vs. Neville for the Cruiserweight Championship: These guys had a terrific match on Raw that saw Tozawa win his first title. Expect more of the same.\n\nPrediction: Also expect the same outcome, Tozawa FTW.\n\nThe Hardys and Jason Jordan vs. The Miz and his Miztourage: The Miz is as entertaining as anyone in WWE today. He's been propelling everyone he's worked with to great heights.

Considering the main show lasts four hours preceded by a two-hour pre-show, the company had little choice but to pad out the card. With a whopping 13 matches signed for \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", a few bouts stand out more than the others. Here some of the scheduled contests that fans might remember the most from WWE's second biggest pay-per-view.\n\nHonorable Mention: The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) (w/Kofi Kingston) (c) vs. The Usos- WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship Match\n\nThe New Day and the Uso's easily delivered the best match at the much maligned SmackDown exclusive Battleground pay-per-view. Unfortunately, the loaded SummerSlam card has relegated these two great teams to sharing time with two other matches along with Peter Rosenburg and the gang on the Kickoff Show. New Day and the Uso's probably won't receive as much time for their match as they did last month and depending on when the match takes place, they might not have that much crowd heat behind them either. These five men have produced some of the best segments on an otherwise slumping SmackDown show and deserve a better than what they will likely get. The workrate should entertain the fans filing into Barclays Center, but its placement and possible lack of reaction will likely hurt it.\n\nHonorable Mention: Naomi (c) vs. Natalya- WWE SmackDown Women's Championship Match\n\nThis match gets an honorable mention for the potential post-match shenanigans more so than the match itself. Nothing against these two ladies, Natalya is one of the best workers on in the company and SmackDown Women's Champion Naomi is arguably the best athlete in the division, but their match received almost no build on television. Both women wrestled a few times leading up to SummerSlam but didn't get much mic time aside from a brief exchange on the SmackDown after Battleground. Much of the build centered around Ms. Money in the Bank Carmella and the possibility of her cashing in the briefcase (hopefully more successfully than Baron Corbin). The prospect of Carmella using her guaranteed title shot could divert the audience's attention away from the title match, causing them to wait for the finish and not care about anything before that. The match should be fine (and will probably have its time cut if the company's history with women's matches on big shows is any indication) but the likelihood of a cash-in will be the talking point.\n\nJinder Mahal (w/The Singh Brothers) (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura- WWE World Championship Match\n\nRoughly three months ago, the thought of Jinder Mahal taking part in a main event of SmackDown, let alone a PPV was unfathomable. Yet here he is, the WWE World Champion in one of the most prominent matches of the second biggest WWE show of the year. Mahal has improved on the stick in recent weeks and after a couple of months is finally kind of starting to feel like a World Champion. His substandard main events still hold him back and he still needs to add more substance to his promos beyond the generic foreign heel talking points (for no other reason than to avoid cringe-worthy fan reactions like in the opening segment last Tuesday). This Sunday, Mahal has the biggest match of his career against one of the biggest stars from New Japan Pro Wrestling, Shinsuke Nakamura. The \"King of Strong Style\" has fallen short of both fans and journalists high expectations since his post-WrestleMania call-up, largely due to the booking (i.e. Vince McMahon thinking Nakamura is a Prince cosplayer) and below-average matches with Corbin and Dolph Ziggler. \"The Lone Wolf's\" failed cash-in attempt erases some suspense in the finish, but if Nakamura pulls a good match out of Mahal before the inevitable Singh Brothers interference, it should stick out on a show with solid but mundane undercard. A title change could make the bout even more memorable. Hopefully, the match doesn't stand out for all the wrong reasons (poor workrate, etc.). If nothing else, the entrances should be cool.\n\nSheamus and Cesaro (c) vs. Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose- WWE Raw Tag Team Championship Match\n\nWhen Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins bumped fists in unison after disposing of Sheamus and Cesaro on the go-home edition of RAW, the crowd came unglued. Aside from the main event, this storyline got the best build of all the SummerSlam matches, setting the stage for what could be one of the best matches on the card. All four men are world class workers, and they should have no problem telling a great story in the ring. That said, this could be the first of several matches between these two teams, meaning they could hold some things back for future encounters on shows that could give them a brighter spotlight. Even if both duos restrain themselves for bouts down the line, they should still have one of the most memorable matches of the night.\n\nBrock Lesnar (w/Paul Heyman) (c) vs. Braun Strowman vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe- Fatal-4-Way Match for the WWE Universal Championship, if Lesnar loses the title, he and Heyman will leave WWE\n\nThe fatal-four-way main event featuring the RAW brand's biggest behemoths feels worthy of its top billing. The bookers have effectively protected each wrestler, creating an air of unpredictability in regard to the result. Incumbent Universal Champion Brock Lesnar always comes across as a megastar; putting him on the marquee of any event instantly adds something to the show. That said, the three challengers also feel like larger than life stars. Samoa Joe has been nothing short of outstanding since entering the title picture last June; he has come across as a believable tough guy who can beat the best of the best. His brief but memorable performance at Great Balls of Fire against Lesnar helped wash away some early lackluster in-ring efforts as well. Since starting his monster push, Braun Strowman has awed fans with his feats of strength and his ability to survive attempts on his life. The greenest worker in the match, Strowman has exceeded the fans and critics wildest expectations in the ring, and can only get better with time. Ironically, the man McMahon envisions as his top star, Roman Reigns, possesses the least star power of the quartet. Even still, Vince's chosen one does not feel out of place trading blows with the others. All four men should produce a memorable, chaotic main event that leaves the fans yearning for one-on-one matches going forward. Provided the fans aren't burned out by the long run time (which would be a story in and of itself), Lesnar, Strowman, Reigns and Joe should be able to give the fans a fun championship match.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T03:57:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "03:57:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 5}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 2}, {"id": "321765", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Natalya (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalya_(wrestler)", "score": 4}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 3}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 5}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 3}, {"id": "340549", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dean Ambrose"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Ambrose", "score": 3}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 5}, {"id": "340559", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dolph Ziggler"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolph_Ziggler", "score": 2}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340569", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Seth Rollins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rollins", "score": 3}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 2}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 2}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 2}, {"id": "349174", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "The Usos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Usos", "score": 3}, {"id": "358612", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New Japan Pro Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Japan_Pro_Wrestling", "score": 2}, {"id": "365537", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vince McMahon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon", "score": 2}, {"id": "374391", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman", "score": 2}, {"id": "415998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Consequences Creed"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequences_Creed", "score": 3}, {"id": "422658", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sheamus"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheamus", "score": 3}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 4}, {"id": "501661", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kofi Kingston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Kingston", "score": 3}, {"id": "509942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Big E Langston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_E_Langston", "score": 3}, {"id": "556811", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Antonio Cesaro"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Cesaro", "score": 3}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 2}, {"id": "1273356", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The New Day (wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Day_(wrestling)", "score": 5}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 3}], "image": "https://img.vavel.com/sslam-logo-1-4953230312.jpg", "timeCrawl": "13:32:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Which WWE SummerSlam matches will stand out?", "originalArticle": null}

Reigning champion Brock Lesnar and his advocate Paul Heyman have threatened in recent weeks to leave the WWE if The Beast loses due to the odds stacked against him. With Lesnar rumored to be headed back to the UFC for a potential fight against Jon Jones, a new champion will most likely be crowned here.\n\nDue to Samoa Joe's impressive display against Lesnar at Great Balls of Fire, The Destroyer barely edges out Reigns and Strowman as a potential winner who only needs to lock in his fabled Coquina Clutch submission maneuver onto any of the competitors to win the match.\n\nPredicted winner: Samoa Joe\n\nJinder Mahal (champion) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the WWE Championship\n\nDespite Shinsuke Nakamura's impressive win over John Cena recently to earn this championship match, the odds may prove too difficult for WWE's resident Rockstar to overcome as Jinder Mahal will once again be backed by his henchmen, The Singh Brothers. Always willing to do whatever it takes to win, including enlisting the help of past champions, Mahal will once again cheat his way to victory among a chorus of boos.\n\nCorbin will be out for blood Cena's blood since he ruined his chance at becoming WWE Champion Tuesday on Smackdown when he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. Cena, who has repeatedly embarrassed The Lone Wolf, keeps a busy schedule outside of WWE and may be headed toward another sabbatical. There is also the fact that Cena announced in July that he is a free agent able to compete on either Raw or Smackdown to consider as he may move onto the red brand in the near future to face new challengers. This makes Corbin the likely winner as WWE will want him to look strong as he attempts to climb back into the championship picture on Tuesday nights.\n\nA special guest referee always equals some type of shenanigans taking place in a match and this will be no different. Expect Shane McMahon to get involved physically in this bout and for the Smackdown commissioner to use his power in order to select and favor either AJ Styles or Kevin Owens to win the match. Destined to feud with the loser, and with McMahon having already faced Styles at WrestleMania, The Phenomenal One will win setting up a future confrontation between McMahon and Owens.\n\nThere is no stopping this Shield reunion between Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins that has been building up for weeks. The Hounds of Justice are back and will prove too formidable for Cesaro and Sheamus as WWE looks to bring back one the most popular factions of all time. With championship gold around their waist, perhaps afterwards Ambrose and Rollins will approach Roman Reigns about rejoining their ranks as well.\n\nPredicted winners: Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins\n\nNaomi (champion) vs. Natalya for the Smackdown Women's Championship\n\nNaomi's feel-good championship run shows no signs of slowing down and she has yet to face the other women present on the Smackdown roster making her the favorite to win. The most exciting thing about this match, however, is that Carmella will be waiting in the wings with her Money in the Bank briefcase. There is no better time than SummerSlam for The Princess of Staten Island to cash in on a depleted Naomi and become the new Smackdown Women's Champion.\n\nPredicted winner: Naomi, followed by Carmella cashing her Money in the Bank briefcase to become the new Smackdown Women's Champion\n\nAlexa Bliss (champion) vs. Sasha Banks for the Raw Women's Championship\n\nSasha Banks is acting as a replacement here for Bayley who has been forced to miss out on SummerSlam due to injury. This makes Alexa Bliss the easy favorite to win as she moves on to feud with Nia Jax who has remained in the championship picture.\n\nBray Wyatt has awakened Finn Balor's demon persona which will be out in full force at SummerSlam much to the Eater of Worlds' dismay. After losing to Wyatt recently on Raw, Balor will come out victorious at SummerSlam, however, Sunday will serve as just the latest chapter in this feud that will continue on for at least another month.\n\nPredicted winner: Finn Balor\n\nSummerSlam will also feature Smackdown Tag Team Champions The New Day defending their titles against The Usos; Randy Orton taking on Rusev; Big Show facing off against Big Cass with Enzo Amore suspended above the ring in a shark cage; Cruiserweight Champion Akira Tozawa defending his title against Neville; and The Hardy Boyz with Jason Jordan battling Intercontinental Champion The Miz and his Miztourage.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T14:28:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "14:28:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 3}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

His daughter, current WWE superstar Charlotte, posted a photo of her family on Instagram and thanked everyone for their support.\n\nHi guys, On behalf of my family and I, we want to THANK everyone for the prayers, texts, calls and support. Our Dad is a FIGHTER and your continued thoughts and prayers MEAN THE WORLD to us. \u1f64f\u1f3fb\u1f49c We will update everyone when we have more information. \u1f4aa\u1f3fb\u1f600\u2764\ufe0f\n\nA post shared by Charlotte Flair (@charlottewwe) on Aug 15, 2017 at 4:58am PDT\n\nAll of us wish the best for Flair in his fight and hope to see him back strutting his stuff like only the \"Nature Boy\" can.\n\nWWE \"SummerSlam\" lineup\n\n\"SummerSlam,\" the second biggest event on the WWE calendar, takes place this Sunday from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and airs live on the WWE Network.\n\nThe excitement for the show has been mixed and many of the matches feel like something you get almost any week on either \"RAW\" or \"SmackDown,\" but there's no denying a heightened anticipation for the main event and who will leave as the WWE Universal Champion. Paul Heyman has stated repeatedly that he and Lesnar will leave WWE if \"The Beast\" loses his championship that night, feeding off rumors that Lesnar will return to the UFC.\n\nIt's a packed card featuring 12 matches over the expected six-hour-plus show if you included the pre-show.\n\nHere is the entire card:\n\n-- Fatal 4-Way for the Universal Championship: Brock Lesnar vs. Braun Strowman vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe\n\n-- WWE Championship: Jinder Mahal vs. Shinsuke Nakamura\n\n-- United States Championship: AJ Styles vs. Kevin Owens with Shane McMahon as the special referee\n\n-- \"RAW\" Tag Team Championships: Sheamus and Cesaro vs. Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose\n\n-- \"RAW\" Women's Championship: Alexa Bliss vs. Sasha Banks\n\n-- \"SmackDown\" Women's Championship: Naomi vs. Natalya\n\n-- John Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\n-- Randy Orton vs. Rusev\n\n-- Finn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\n-- Big Show vs. Big Cass with Enzo suspended over the ring in a shark cage\n\n-- Pre-show match for the Cruiserweight Championship: Akira Tozawa vs. Neville\n\n-- Pre-show match for the \"SmackDown\" Tag Team Championships: The New Day vs. The Usos\n\nQuick predictions: Brock Lesnar retains the Universal Championship and continues his dominant reign; Jinder Mahal gets a helping hand from the Singh brothers to keep the WWE Championship; AJ Styles holds on to the United States after Shane McMahon gets involved, leading to an in-ring showdown with Kevin Owens; Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose band together to win gold; Sasha Banks dethrones Alexa Bliss; Carmella teases cashing in her case but holds off after Naomi wins; John Cena racks up another victory, as does Randy Orton; Balor transforms into \"The Demon\" get revenge; Big Cass wins against the \"injured\" giant who is selling a broken hand; Tozawa gets a second straight win over his nemesis; The New Day still rocks as tag champs.\n\nWhile the Fatal 4-Way looks to be the most exciting match, don't sleep on Sheamus and Cesaro versus Rollins and Ambrose, which could steal the show.\n\nNXT \"TakeOver: Brooklyn III\" set\n\nDon't miss @REALBobbyRoode vs. @DMcIntyreWWE, @WWEEmberMoon vs. @WWEAsuka, and more at #NXTTakeOver: Brooklyn THIS SATURDAY at 8e/5p! pic.twitter.com/VTpb6Whzco -- WWE (@WWE)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nThe night before \"SummerSlam\" will be the latest \"TakeOver\" -- also airing on the WWE Network -- which have become must-see events from the hungry NXT crew under the leadership of Triple H.\n\nThis one should be no different in front of a likely raucous Brooklyn crowd on Saturday night. Five matches are set for that evening including:\n\n-- NXT Championship: Bobby Roode vs. Drew McIntyre\n\n-- NXT Women's Championship: Asuka vs. Ember Moon\n\n-- NXT Tag Team Championship: Authors of Pain vs. Sanity\n\n-- Aleister Black vs. Hideo Itami\n\n-- Johnny Gargano vs. Andrade Almas\n\nQuick predictions: McIntyre upends Roode in a feel-good moment upon his return back to the promotion; Ember Moon ends Asuka's incredible title reign which has now lasted more than 500 days; Sanity wins the tag titles; Aleister Black scores a hard-winning victory; the silky-smooth Johnny Gargano earns a win.\n\nWhile my predictions may be a bit of a stretch considering I have all three of their championships changing hands, there is a method to that thinking. Roode, Asuka, and AOP could each get a main-roster call-up in the near future. That especially makes sense for veterans Roode and Asuka who have done about all they can in NXT and have been more than ready to ply their craft with the rest of the WWE roster.\n\nNew Japan G1 Climax sets new bar of excellence\n\nGood luck trying to surpass this year's tournament considering the talent level and the incredible matches that occurred every show over the past month.\n\nMake no mistake about it: the 2017 G1 Climax was the best in that company's history and the greatest tournament we've ever seen in professional wrestling history.\n\nThe final weekend concluded came to a crescendo with three more epic tournament matches. Tetsuya Naito defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi in the latest unbelievable match between the two Japanese stars to win the \"A\" block. Over in the \"B\" block, Kenny Omega advanced to the finals after finally scoring a victory against Kazuchika Okada in another instant classic to cap off their incredible trilogy over the past seven months.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the finals saw yet another amazing performance with Naito defeating Omega to become a two-time G1 champion. That sets him up to challenge Omega for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at January's \"Wrestle Kingdom 12,\" annually New Japan's biggest event of the year.\n\nNew Japan continues has stepped up to yet another level, proving to be an attractive alternative for fans looking more for great, in-ring action with confluent storylines opposed to the sports entertainment that WWE provides. New Japan World -- their online streaming service with live feeds of big events and archives of all their shows -- continues to be a great value at less than nine dollars a month.\n\nNews and notes\n\n-- It felt like a negative approval rating for Baron Corbin on \"SmackDown\" as he surprisingly cashed in his \"Money in the Bank\" briefcase, only to lose in six seconds to Jinder Mahal following a John Cena distraction. The \"Lone Wolf\" looked to be on a path to the world championship after winning the case earlier this year. Plans can change quickly and we'll have to see what the immediate future now holds for Corbin.\n\n-- Daniel Bryan has never definitively said that he will never wrestle again despite announcing his retirement in early 2016 following concussion issues. There's been more and more speculation that Bryan will return to the ring and his wife, Brie Bella, told the \"From The Top Rope\" podcast that \"I know for a fact he is going to find his way back to the ring.\"\n\nBella went on to say that her husband has undergone extensive testing over the past few years and, more recently, has been using Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for treatment. It's obvious that he is gearing up for a return if he can get cleared by doctors. The question at that point is will the WWE allow him back in their ring or will he go elsewhere where he could provide a huge boost in business.\n\nBrian Fritz can be reached at btrfritz@gmail.com.

The show, which has one seriously stacked card, is expected to run for over 6 hours and features some of the year's most intriguing match-ups, including arguably the biggest main event of 2017 so far.\n\nHere are my predictions for this Sunday's show.\n\nPre-Show: Neville Vs Akira Tozawa (Cruiserweight Title)\n\nThis week's go home shows were surprising, to say the least. One of the biggest surprises was Neville dropping his Cruiserweight title to Akira Tozawa on Raw. While the decision to do it on an episode of Raw was baffling, if they have done it to get the rematch out of the way quickly and they move Neville up the card, where he belongs, then I'm fine with that. Expect Tozawa to retain on Sunday, perhaps with a little help from Titus and Co.\n\nPrediction: Akira Tozawa Retains\n\nPre-Show: The New Day Vs The Usos (SmackDown Tag Team Titles)\n\nThe New Day's match with The Usos stole the show at last month's Battleground and if given the right amount of time, the two teams could potentially do the same thing Sunday night, even if they have been relegated to the pre-show. The feud between these two teams has injected some real life back into the tag division in the last month and it is difficult to see where it is going to go once their feud comes to an end.\n\nThat does look to be the case on Sunday night, though, with smart money being on The New Day retaining their tag team belts and moving on to a new feud post-SummerSlam.\n\nBig Cass has been excellent in his new heel role and his heat levels right now are borderline nuclear. Enzo Amore's presence above the ring in this match might not be as cut and dry as it appears, either. While Enzo is likely going to help out The Big Show in this match, don't be surprised if he doesn't help Cass in an effort to prove his worth to his former friend. The Club interfering and forming 'The Cass Club' or something along those lines is also another possibility.\n\nWhichever way this one goes down, Cass should walk away as the winner. Big Show doesn't need a victory over an up and coming superstar.\n\nA lot of people are big fans of Naomi and her title reign, I am not one of them. While her initial title victory at Mania was a nice moment, her reign has not been particularly inspiring and I wouldn't be too disheartened if she dropped the belt on Sunday. Natalya is a great heel performer and while she is not the most original choice for a big match at Summerslam, a victory for her would be more welcomed.\n\nA Carmella cash in shouldn't be ruled out on Sunday either, especially not after Corbin's failed attempt this past Tuesday night. As much as I'd like to see her drop the belt, I suspect Naomi will live to fight another day on Sunday.\n\nWWE will have to tread very carefully with their handling of Baron Corbin from now on. Following up The Lone Wolf's failed cash in attempt with a big match defeat could end his chances as a main eventer on the main roster so a win on Sunday should be a must.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't see the WWE giving Cena yet another loss at SummerSlam, with big match John having suffered six defeats in a row at the event. Expect him to buck that trend on Sunday and walk away victorious, leaving Corbin with one hell of a mountain to climb.\n\nWhile this match has been cobbled together over the last few weeks due to Bayley getting injured on an episode of Raw, the two women involved are arguably the most talented on the Raw roster right now and I'm positive that they will put on a good show.\n\nWith such a big card, though, I do suspect that this match may end up being a very brief affair, especially considering it wasn't planned in the first place. Bliss will retain here.\n\nPrediction: Alexa Bliss Retains\n\nSeth Rollins and Dean Ambrose Vs Sheamus and Cesaro (Raw Tag Team Titles)\n\nI've been calling for a full blown Shield reunion for some time now, and while this may not be the complete works, I'm happy enough with it. Ambrose and Rollins were doing a whole load of nothing in the mid card and their careers had stalled; putting them together creates interest in the pair of them and the \"will they, won't they?\" approach to their reunion is working well.\n\nSheamus and Cesaro have had a great run with the belts, but with Sheamus rumoured to be taking time off in the coming months, expect the former Shield members to walk away with the belts on Sunday.\n\nPrediction: Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins win\n\nKevin Owens Vs AJ Styles w/Special Guest Ref: Shane McMahon (US Title)\n\nWith rumours indicating that a match between Kevin Owens and Shane McMahon will be taking place in the coming months, smart money here would be on AJ Styles retaining the belt. While Shane isn't likely to out and out screw Owens, expect him to inadvertently cost him the victory in one way or another. This will no doubt lead to a programme between the two beginning properly next week on SmackDown, while AJ can move on to his next opponent.\n\nA cobbled together feud to give both men a match-up at SummerSlam, the best case scenario here would be if Rusev were to pick up the victory and begin an ascent towards the WWE title picture. As much as I'd love to see that happen, it seems a lot more likely than Orton will get the victory after doing the business for Jinder on the last three PPVs. Poor Ru-Ru.\n\nThe two most wasted talents on the Raw roster will meet this Sunday night in what should be an entertaining affair. The two have been involved in an on-off feud for the last few months but things have heated up in the last few weeks, with Bray dumping blood on Balor after defeating him on the go-home show.\n\nFinn needs the victory here. He needs to be established as a contender for the belt again in the coming months, while Bray, despite having PPV victories over Randy Orton and Seth Rollins this year, still remains at a loose end. It is also important the company keep Finn unbeaten as the Demon King.\n\nWWE has removed a layer of intrigue from this match with Baron Corbin failing to cash in on Tuesday night, but this is still one of the most interesting matches on the card. Jinder's reign has been fairly lacklustre but many fans remain unsure as to whether Shinsuke is ready to run with the belt yet.\n\nPersonally, this one is a no brainer. Shinsuke is a massive talent and while, due to some poor booking, he hasn't quite taken off in the way they would have expected, he is still a much better option as champion than Jinder. This match could go either way, especially with Jinder's cronies hanging around ringside. I'm going to have faith in the company though and give this one to Shinsuke.\n\nPrediction: Shinsuke Nakamura Wins\n\nBrock Lesnar Vs Samoa Joe Vs Roman Reigns Vs Braun Strowman (Universal Title)\n\nSummerSlam has one hell of a stacked card, but the only match everyone really wants to see is this one. Everyone involved in this match is on fire right now and this is easily the biggest WWE match of the year so far.\n\nRumours of Brock Lesnar leaving the WWE have added even more fuel to this match and every man involved could stake a claim to being the victor, so let's try and break them down. Roman Reigns is clearly being primed for another big Wrestlemania victory, so you can rule him out here, while I suspect there are still some legs left in more Braun/Roman matches, so let's take Braun out of the picture too.\n\nJoe is the most likely person to dethrone Brock on Sunday. The former NXT champion has been on fire in recent months and has helped make Raw the company's best show once again. Having him take the belt off Lesnar on Sunday would be a huge moment for him and I wouldn't rule that out totally.\n\nThe most logical conclusion, though, is Lesnar keeping hold of his belt. The stipulation that, if he loses, he leaves the WWE indicates that he is not likely to drop the belt Sunday. He still has some big potential matches with Braun and Finn Balor in the coming months before he ultimately loses to Reigns at Mania so expect him to hold on to the gold on Sunday.\n\nPrediction: Brock Lesnar Retains", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T07:54:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "07:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

Once again, the pay-per-view will be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn as will Raw on the following night, and those running the arena's social media may have gotten ahead of themselves. In the last week, a few tweets may have spoiled the PPV main event and a huge surprise for Monday.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, the official Twitter account of the Barclays Center took to promoting their huge WWE events coming up on Sunday and Monday. As reported by PW Mania, one of their tweets was for Monday Night Raw on August 21, and it revealed that Brock Lesnar will be there in person.\n\nUnfortunately for those that saw it, there was another bit of information in the tweet that was quickly deleted, but many still caught what it said.\n\nAs you can see, it is saying that Brock Lesnar will be the Universal Champion on Monday night which means he would be the one winning in the main event of SummerSlam.\n\nMany said that they just said this because he is the current WWE Universal Champion, but it doesn't mean that SummerSlam was spoiled. Others pointed out the storyline where Paul Heyman said his client would leave WWE if he lost the Universal Title this Sunday at the PPV.\n\nIf Brock Lesnar is scheduled to be on Monday Night Raw, that seems to mean he will still be the champion by that time.\n\nThis tweet was deleted, but the Barclays Center Twitter account posted another spoiler-filled announcement last week. Everyone knows that John Cena is currently listed as a \"free agent\" and set to face Baron Corbin at SummerSlam, but Pop Culture caught a tweet that may have spoiled his return date to Raw.\n\nWe're 10 days away from @WWE Monday Night RAW. Don't miss Free Agent @JohnCena live here in Brooklyn on 8/21! #WWEBrooklyn pic.twitter.com/d4dMrsT5eW\n\n-- Barclays Center (@barclayscenter) August 11, 2017\n\nA couple of weeks ago, the Inquisitr reported that the official website of WWE was promoting John Cena's scheduled appearance at No Mercy in September. That pay-per-view is a Raw-exclusive event and as of now, he's still doing work on SmackDown Live.\n\nWith his free agent status, he can jump brands as he sees fit, but it appears he's headed for Monday nights very soon. It's just interesting that the Barclays Center left this tweet up but deleted the one about Lesnar.\n\nFor now, all of this needs to be taken as rumor and speculation as it may have been a mistake by the Barclays Center or it could have been someone posting something way too early.\n\nNo matter what ends up happening, WWE has the ability to change things up at the last minute and alter these spoilers if they're actually true. SummerSlam still has to take place on Sunday night before Monday Night Raw can begin, and that's a lot of decision making that needs to be done. Either way, it will be interesting to see if Brock Lesnar is still the Universal Champion and if free agent John Cena shows up for Team Red.\n\n[Featured Image by WWE]\n\nDanny Cox", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T01:11:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 681, "textStart": 672, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-21", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1965, "textStart": 1950, "date": "2017-08-11", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373948", "time": "01:11:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302545", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "score": 3}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 4}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "323448", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kayfabe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe", "score": 3}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 5}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 5}, {"id": "332484", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE brand extension"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Brand_Extension", "score": 2}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 4}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 4}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 5}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 3}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 5}, {"id": "374391", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman", "score": 3}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 2}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "22:39:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "WWE Rumors: Site Of 'SummerSlam' Spoils Main Event And Huge Surprise For Next Week's 'Monday Night Raw'", "originalArticle": null}

He was there with his WWE championship belt in hand, the result of years of hard work and a never-quit attitude.\n\nFollowing his release in 2013, Dhesi recommitted himself to fitness and clean eating, and pushed himself back onto the WWE's radar. In the summer of 2016, his work paid off. Less than one year later, Mahal became the WWE's 50th heavyweight champion. Since then, Mahal has been successfully defending his championship, been a part of WWE's growth around the world, specifically in the homeland of his parents, India, and emerged as a viable main event player. On Sunday, he'll defend that championship, which he won in May, when he faces Japanese megastar Shinsuke Nakamura.\n\nFor Mahal, the learning curve at the top of the WWE roster has been steep.\n\n\"I get asked a lot, 'Did you celebrate? What was it like?'\" Mahal answered when asked about his reign, which is now at three months and counting. \"Honestly, I didn't have a moment where it was like, 'Oh my god, I accomplished something,'\" he said. \"My goals are a lot bigger than this. I worked very, very hard to get here, but I knew that the hard work was just beginning.\"\n\nBesides an increased presence on TV and at pay-per-views, Majal has seen his presence within the company grow as well, which has translated into more media interviews, merchandise opportunities, his image on more posters and WWE promotional tools. It's a responsibility, he said, that he takes very seriously.\n\n\"As the WWE champion, you're the face of the company,\" he said. \"I look at things totally differently now. Every live event, I'm asking the marketing rep what the gate was, what the attendance was, what it was last time we were here. I ask about my merchandise sales... From a business point of view, I'm a lot different. And obviously the media that I've been doing has increased quite a bit, which I enjoy because ultimately, the more media I do, the bigger my brand becomes and ultimately the more value I am to WWE.\"\n\nMahal also seems to have gotten his bad guy character over, as fans everywhere boo him appropriately as a bad guy, rather than as someone who doesn't interest them. Everywhere, that is, except in his homeland of Canada. During appearances in Kingston, and a live TV taping of Smackdown Live in Toronto, Mahal's normal boos were replaced by noticeable ovations, a nation tipping its collective cap to the Canadian-born champ.\n\n\"Toronto was amazing,\" Mahal acknowledged. \"It's actually one of my favourite crowds that I've ever performed in front of.\"\n\nThe adulation at the Air Canada Centre wasn't entirely unexpected, Mahal admitted. \"Even Randy (Orton, his opponent in Toronto) knew. A week before, we knew that we were going to have the match and he's like, 'Oh, it's going to be in Toronto, it should be interesting.' I was like, 'Yeah, it will be.' I thought it was going to be like 50/50, but man, we were in the beginning and Randy was punching me and the crowd's booing. It was awesome.\"\n\nMahal admitted the love from Canada made the trip special.\n\n\"I know Canada's very proud. I'm from Calgary, but all of Canada is very proud. Interesting note, Smackdown followed Raw (also in Toronto one night earlier), and I had asked about the attendance and we weren't that far off from Raw, which is big because sometimes Smackdown is significantly lower.\"\n\nThe significance of being one of the main events at SummerSlam, WWE's second-biggest event of the year next to WrestleMania, isn't lost on the Albertan, who has never competed at a SummerSlam.\n\n\"All the other previously SummerSlams, I've been unfortunately sitting in catering and watching the show and wishing I could be on the show,\" Mahal noted. \"But now this is my moment. Not only am I on the card, I'm in a WWE Champoinship match, one of the main events, against someone like Shinsuke Nakamura, who is an international superstar.

Styles, along with one of the company's great ambassadors, Dana Warrior, the widow of the late Ultimate Warrior.\n\nAt first stunned and unsure, the kids, eight in all ranging in age from very young to late teenS, were taken aback as they walked through the observatory and encountered their heroes. Hugs, tears, photos, smiles, more hugs and still more hugs followed.\n\nIt was the latest collaboration between WWE and Make-A-Wish, a relationship that dates several decades at this point.\n\n\"It starts at the top,\" Sue Aitchison, director of community relations for WWE, said in an interview with Postmedia at the event. \"Vince and Linda (McMahon). Linda used to do the wishes when the company first started.\"\n\nJust eight months into 2017, Aitchison said WWE and its superstars already have granted 41 wishes for Make-A-Wish, and 92 overall this year with other wish agencies around the world.\n\n\"It's beautiful, honestly,\" Rollins said. \"Being up in the One World Observatory, on the 102nd floor, looking out over New York City and being able to hang out with the Make-A-Wish families. It just feels like a lot of love all around.\n\n\"For some Americans, I feel like this building, it's really a tribute, a testament to America as whole, to our country and to the world as a whole, coming together after adversity, coming through and pushing out better on the other. That's what these kids and these families are all about, dealing with adversity every single day and still putting a smile on and just moving forward.\"\n\nNikki Bella's real-life fianc\u00e9, John Cena, has single-handedly granted every wish he's every received, now at 600 and counting for Make-A-Wish alone.\n\n\"His heart is just truly so big and giving and caring and humble,\" Nikki said. \"With Make-A-Wish, this is something that he holds so dear to his heart. Whoever makes a wish, he grants it. And when you see it, when you these kids see John when he walks in the room, it makes me melt and it makes me emotional. He truly cares. I love that.\"\n\nStyles said opportunities like the Make-A-Wish gatherings put life into perspective.\n\n\"There's a lot of silly stuff going on in this country and in this world right now,\" he said. \"If you come here and you experience what it's like to look into a kid's eyes and know what they've been through, it changes your whole perspective on everything. This is what's important.\"\n\nAitchison paid homage to the WWE stars for all they do behind the scenes.\n\n\"You know them (as wrestlers), and I know a different side of them,\" she said, adding that the love the stars shower on to the kids is genuine and not contrived.\n\n\"Kids aren't stupid. They know when someone's paying them lip service and they know when somebody cares. And I never have a problem with our guys walking into the room. It's very obvious they care.\"\n\nBy that measure, no one cares more than Cena, the long-time face of WWE and supporter of granting wishes.\n\n\"There isn't a celebrity or any other (athlete) who has done as many,\" Aitchison said, adding that on top of the roughly 600 wishes granted through Make-A-Wish, he's done countless others for other wish agencies around the world.\n\nZiggler marvelled at Cena's efforts.\n\n\"Unreal,\" he said. \"Unreal,\" he repeated, \"because he doesn't have to do any of them. He's done it all in this business and he's done it all outside the business. To have something that he still genuinely looks forward to -- and I know he does because I do, too -- it's unreal.\"\n\nNikki has experienced many of her fiance's Make-A-Wish efforts, but her own as well.\n\n\"It's so empowering,\" she added. \"And I remember all of their faces. Every single one.\"\n\nSUMMERSLAM ODDS ARE RELEASED\n\nIt's no secret that the outcomes of World Wrestling Entertainment matches are pre-determined, yet that hasn't stopped an online gambling site from offering odds and taking bets on SummerSlam matches.\n\nBovada, online at bovada.lv, on Friday issued the odds for many of Sunday's SummerSlam matchups, a peculiar move given wrestling's outcomes are known before they begin.\n\nBettors can place a wager on the Universal Heavyweight Championship match, which features champion Brock Lesnar defending his title against Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe in a Fatal Fourway match. Lesnar is the heavy favourite at 3/10. Strowman is the favourite if an upset should occur, at 12/1, while Reigns is the clear underdog at 19/2.\n\nShinsuke Nakamura is favoured over Canadian Jinder Mahal, the current WWE champion, while Sasha Banks is favoured to win the Raw Women's Championship.\n\nOther favourites include A.J. Styles over Kevin Owens, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins over Raw tag champs Sheamus and Cesaro, Smackdown tag champs The New Day over challengers The Usos, John Cena over Baron Corbin, Rusev over Randy Orton, Finn Balor over Bray Wyatt and Big Cass is a heavy favourite over Big Show.\n\nRap megastar and World Wrestling Entertainment hall of famer Snoop Dogg surprised a packed house at an invitation only event at SIR Stage 37 in New York on Saturday during the WWE 2K18 video game launch party.\n\nFollowing a red carpet media event that featured more than a dozen WWE stars being interviewed by hundreds of members of the media from 16 different countries, the hip-hop icon took the stage flanked by his cousin, WWE women's division star Sasha Banks.\n\nThe marijuana advocate, who openly smoked pot during his performance, is a longtime WWE supporter who has been featured on WWE programming many times and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nWWE 2K18 features Seth Rollins on its cover and will hits stores in October.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T22:56:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373948", "time": "22:56:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "218049", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 4}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

Fans who will not be able to witness WWE Summerslam 2017 live are probably wondering how they can still catch the big fights. Luckily, details of how to watch the event has been released as well as information about the fights fans can expect to see.\n\nAs WWE Summerslam 2017 is a Pay-Per-View event, audiences in the United Kingdom will have to pay \u00a319.95 on SkyBox Office either live or on repeat. Fans can also watch the event through the official WWE network through gaming consoles, smart home and mobile devices, or even on the WWE website itself. For those who won't be able to watch through the options stated, there may be some fans who will most likely live-blog the event. It is also possible that an updated report would be posted on social media.\n\nMuch like every other Summerslam event that came before, there will be matches that a lot of people will anticipate. Some will defend their titles, whereas some will be in the main event, which can either be in keeping with an ongoing feud between superstars or an extreme kind of match where it could get bloody.\n\nFirst up, a few of the title matches. It will be Natalya against Trinity Fatu for the Women's Championship. Natalya has been on a winning streak lately, having emerged victorious in a 5-way match against Charlotte Flair, Lana, Tamina, and Becky Lynch. However, Trinity has also been holding her own, continously defending her title. Could Summerslam 2017 be the event where her winning streak will break?\n\nBrock Lesnar will go up against three heavyweights for the Universal Championship title. Lesnar will fight Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman, and Samoa Joe. Lesnar has previously threatened to leave the WWE should he lose the match, since he does not like the fact that he has to defend his title against three opponents.\n\nThe ongoing feud between John Cena and Baron Corbin is also a match that viewers will not want to miss.

These odds can often be a good indicator of who is looking to win in their respective matches.\n\nSometimes on the day of the show, the \"smart money\" comes in and a few of the matches make a 180 degree turn. At that point, the odds are usually locked in pretty close to what actually happens, although there are sometimes still some surprises that go against the odds.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with how betting odds work, the competitor with a \"-\" in front of their name is the favorite to win. A \"+\" after the name means they are the underdog. The larger the number, the more of a favorite or underdog that person is.\n\nHere are the early odds for SummerSlam.\n\nWWE Universal Championship - Fatal 4-Way\n\nBrock Lesnar (c) -335 vs Samoa Joe +275 vs Roman Reigns +700 vs Braun Strowman +1000\n\nWWE Championship\n\nJinder Mahal (c) +250 vs Shinsuke Nakamura -400\n\nWWE RAW Women's Championship\n\nAlexa Bliss (c) -125 vs Sasha Banks -112\n\nWWE Smackdown Women's Championship\n\nNaomi (c) -250 vs Natalya +175\n\n(Odds for Carmella successfully cashing in the Money In The Bank briefcase are +150)\n\nWWE United States Championship\n\nAJ Styles (c) -500 vs Kevin Owens +300\n\nWWE RAW Tag Team Championship\n\nCesaro and Sheamus (c) +300 vs Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins -500\n\nWWE Smackdown Tag Team Championship\n\nThe New Day (c) -167 vs The Usos +120\n\nWWE Cruiserweight Championship\n\nAkira Tozawa (c) -125 vs Neville -112\n\nJohn Cena -167 vs Baron Corbin +120\n\nRandy Orton +110 vs Rusev -155\n\nFinn Balor -770 vs Bray Wyatt +400\n\nBig Show +400 vs Big Cass -770\n\nThe Hardy Boyz and Jason Jordan +100 vs The Miztourage -139\n\nThe most shocking part of the odds so far is that Nakamura is a favorite to win the SmackDown World title, as of this writing. Brock Lesnar is the favorite to come out Universal Champion. Interestingly, both Sasha Banks and Alexa Bliss are on the negative/favorite side (which means it would require a higher bet to win money on them), with Bliss being ever so slightly more favored. The same goes for the Cruiserweight title match, with Tozawa slightly favored over Neville.\n\nFinn Balor is the heaviest favorite on the show right now, at -700. Translation of those odds is that it would require a $700 bet to win $100 on him due to how heavily favored he is. That makes sense as it wouldn't make much sense from a booking perspective to have Balor lose in the first match where he has portrayed \"The Demon\" in a year.\n\nby Ryan Droste | August 18, 2017", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T19:16:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2542, "textStart": 2527, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "19:16:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

For the third straight year, WWE's second-biggest show will rock the house in Brooklyn.\n\nWrestleMania has become WWE's Super Bowl, the mainstream event that brings in casual fans from around the globe. But SummerSlam is the event for the fans, the ones who obsess over matchups and storylines and the like. And this year's card is shaping up to be a great one.\n\nIn the main event, we have four monsters who are set to tear the arena apart in pursuit of the WWE Universal Championship, the top title on the \"Monday Night Raw\" brand. Brock Lesnar, the reigning, defending, undisputed champion, will put his title on the line against Roman Reigns (the face of WWE today), Braun Strowman (the 385-pound Monster Among Men), and Samoa Joe (the man who nearly captured the title from Lesnar in July) in a Fatal Four Way match.\n\nOn the \"SmackDown Live\" brand, WWE Champion Jinder Mahal will defend his belt against Shinsuke Nakamura, the Japanese sensation who has captivated audiences with his charisma and unique fighting style. Jinder has barely escaped his previous title defenses in narrow victories thanks to the Singh Brothers, who always seem to show up and interfere right when Jinder is on the ropes.\n\nElsewhere on the card, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins have finally reunited. The former Shield brothers will attempt to wrestle the Raw Tag Team Championship away from Cesaro and Sheamus. AJ Styles will defend the WWE United States Championship against Kevin Owens with Shane McMahon as the special guest referee. And last but by no means least, we have a pair of women's matches, as Alexa Bliss defends the Raw Women's Championship against Sasha Banks, and Naomi puts the SmackDown Women's Championship on the line against Natalya.\n\nThe 13-match card is stacked, and WWE is making it available free of charge to anyone who signs up for a free trial month of the WWE Network.\n\nAnd on top of NXT Takeover: Brooklyn and SummerSlam this weekend, fans can get immediate access to more than 8,000 hours of WWE content, including classic episodes of \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"SmackDown,\" every pay-per-view in WWE history, and even shows from other promotions such as WCW and ECW.\n\nIf you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

There are only two real possibilities to keep an eye on in this match: either Lesnar keeps his title, or he loses it. Photo by JP Yim/AFP\n\nNEW YORK, USA - August is on its way to a close and for professional wrestling fans, that can only mean one thing: it's time for WWE's SummerSlam. What was once just the company's biggest party of the summer has now, thanks to NXT, slowly expanded into the second important sports entertainment pilgrimage of the year.\n\nThe two shows are wildly different from each other on paper and in execution, but if there's one thing that's common between both brands, it's the fact that the WWE is absolutely stacked and overflowing when it comes to its roster. Over the past couple of years the biggest pro wrestling company in the world has hoarded the globe's best (and under-the-radar) talents, and the locker room bursting at the seams means that there won't always be space to feature everyone.\n\nMost of the time it's terrible for fans who love their independent wrestling darlings, but looking at the bigger picture it might be better for everyone. The wrestlers people tend to love are the workhorses who make their money being the best in the ring, and not always having them as the focus of shows can mean they're forced to slow down and preserve themselves somehow. Of course, that doesn't take into consideration performance at live events and the WWE's brutal touring schedule, but hey, it's still taking it easy. And when the top guys eventually have to be pulled aside (for one reason or another, usually due to injury) the others can have their chance to shine.\n\nBut enough about that - you signed up for predictions, didn't you? Let's tackle these shows one at a time:\n\nNXT Takeover: Brooklyn III\n\nAs usual, the WWE's developmental brand likes to keep it simple and strong. Now more than ever NXT is buoyed by the international talents Triple H has signed over the years instead of the actual farm-league guys they're supposed to build.\n\nOnly the Authors of Pain are truly homegrown. NXT's problem now is what you see on a Takeover card betrays the true depth of the roster, and while the minimalistic approach to booking is nice, it doesn't maximize the talent they have. The NXT Championship match could have easily been a triple threat match, there are other people who could be involved, and so on.\n\nJohnny Gargano vs Andrade Cien Almas (with Zelina Vega)\n\nThis match was set up at the last minute, without much alarm, simply because Gargano was back and his former partner Tommaso Ciampa was not (thanks to an injury), and Almas needed something to do after being in limbo. I could see them going into a feud over the fall while Gargano waits for his partner, so this one goes to El Idolo.\n\nThe low-key match to look out for in this whole card, Black vs. Itami should be a wonderful strikefest. It's a good thing they finally brought in better opponents for Black to showcase his skills instead of the quick squashes that started Baron Corbin's career. Itami's currently in a deliberate downward spiral to feed his character, so expect Black to take this one.\n\nWinner: Aleister Black\n\nSANitY (Alexander Wolfe and Killian Dain, with Eric Young and Nikki Cross) vs. The Authors of Pain (with Paul Ellering) (c) for the NXT Tag Team Championship\n\nHere's the thing -- the Authors of Pain are such a great tag team, even though people don't quite realize it. The problem is they've been champs of a lame-duck tag division. Gutting #DIY and losing Australian imports TM61, as well as losing American Alpha and the Revival over the past year means NXT needed to work faster to rebuild the scene, and they just haven't. Without everyone else, the Authors of Pain suddenly have their possibilities limited, and now something has to change in order for things to remain interesting. SANitY is going to win this, as they're bigger heels than the Authors at this point.\n\nWinner: SANitY (new NXT Tag Team Champions)\n\nEmber Moon vs Asuka (c) for the NXT Women's Championship\n\nThere are problems with the women's division as well. Asuka has built up quite the undefeated streak, but NXT hasn't built up an equal contender that's compelling enough to break that streak. Ember Moon could very well win here, but if she doesn't, I wouldn't be surprised if Asuka keeps the title so whoever wins the Mae Young Classic (happening the week after) could challenge her for it.\n\nWinner: Ember Moon (new NXT Women's Champion)\n\nDrew McIntyre vs Bobby Roode (c) for the NXT Championship\n\nRoderick Strong, who had been feuding with Roode since NXT Takeover: Chicago, should have been in this match, and it still boggles me until now why he just isn't. Now Drew McIntyre could very well win this match and ride a wave of support, as Roode also needs something different after being champion for quite a while. It's the Strong wrinkle that makes me think it's not going to happen just yet; if anything, the best course would be to build toward a triple threat at the next Takeover and have the title change hands there.\n\nIf you want to know how ridiculously stacked the WWE locker room is, know that this show has 13 matches on the card, preshow bouts included. It's the same as this year's WrestleMania, and you know how much of a slog that was to go through. The only difference is that there won't be as much spectacle at SummerSlam as there will be at WrestleMania, so I'm hoping we get a leaner show despite the volume. I hope it doesn't clock in at 7 hours again, but I can tell you that it will be packed from top to bottom.\n\nKickoff match: The Hardy Boyz and Jason Jordan vs The Miz and the Miztourage (Curtis Axel and Bo Dallas) (with Maryse)\n\nThe \"everyone gets on the show\" match, expect the face team to win here in order for Jordan to get a shot at Miz's Intercontinental Championship.\n\nWinner: The Hardy Boyz and Jason Jordan\n\nKickoff match: Neville vs. Akira Tozawa (c) (with Titus O'Neil) for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship\n\nAkira Tozawa won the championship on this week's episode of RAW, and it would've been a welcome TV development if it happened way before the go-home episode. Instead it just looks desperate and last-ditch, and now they're kind of cramming new character developments for Neville here. Tozawa retains, because how can he not retain?\n\nWinner: Akira Tozawa\n\nKickoff match: The Usos vs. The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods, with Kofi Kingston) for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship\n\nOf all the things you can bump down to the kickoff, it's the tag title match that has been consistently delivering for SmackDown over the past couple of exclusive PPVs. Yes, the RAW tag title match is now bigger in name power, but nobody should have counted these guys out. This should have been Big Show vs. Big Cass. Anyway, the New Day should be retaining here, but I can see the Usos taking it back as Breezango is waiting in the wings for another deserved shot.\n\nWinner: The New Day\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass, with Enzo Amore suspended above the ring in a shark cage\n\nEnzo Amore's backstage shenanigans have gotten people sour on him, and the hoss fight isn't exactly a good prospect for Cass. Let's just get this over with.\n\nThe throwaway singles feud for two middling upper midcarders on SmackDown that's too bland to be big but too big to be on the kickoff, Orton vs. Rusev is built on nothing at all. It's on the creative SmackDown creative team to find something between these two to turn it up a notch, but right now I don't care that much. And that's bad because I love Rusev. And I do hope he wins.\n\nWinner: Rusev\n\nDean Ambrose and Seth Rollins vs. Cesaro and Sheamus (c) for the RAW Tag Team Championship\n\nThis story, which is one of the best going on RAW and in the WWE right now, is more about Ambrose trusting Rollins (who backstabbed them back in 2014) again than it is about the titles. The titles are only the icing on the cake, and it's some damn good frosting. Cesaro and Sheamus have served us well, but I think it's time for two other solid upper midcarders to win the titles, elevate them further, and start a rollicking new feud.\n\nWinner: Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins (new RAW Tag Team Champions)\n\nNatalya vs. Naomi (c) for the SmackDown Women's Championship\n\nThe result of this match won't be as important as what could possibly happen after, and I do think Ms. Money in the Bank Carmella is cashing in. The SmackDown women's division is in a holding pattern after Natalya won the contendership, as better wrestlers like Charlotte and Becky Lynch are waiting in the wings.\n\nWinner: Naomi\n\nSasha Banks vs. Alexa Bliss (c) for the RAW Women's Championship\n\nI also believe that it's Banks's time, and it's her time to win the title on a big stage. The RAW women's division has had a winding journey to get to SummerSlam, what with Bayley getting injured after winning the contendership, so at this point they might as well embrace it and give it to Banks to spark the feud further.\n\nSo this match is just the return of the Demon Finn Balor, and they gave this match away on this week's episode of RAW like the Cruiserweight Championship match. Same criticisms here: if they were going to do this on TV, they should've done so a while back and build up to the rematch at SummerSlam.\n\nFor those who didn't catch this week's episode of SmackDown, Baron Corbin attempted to cash in... and failed. I'm not talking about he gave the briefcase to the referee and the match didn't happen due to some interference, but he actually cashed it in, the bell rang, and he failed after he tried to take care of John Cena first from interfering and Jinder Mahal pinned him. It's the third failed cash-in in Money in the Bank history, and other than the fact that we now know there will be no Money in the Bank shenanigans in the WWE Championship match.\n\nThis may indicate that there is some disfavor with Baron Corbin backstage, and the result of this match will be the ultimate test of that. Cena has historically lost a lot of big matches at SummerSlam than at WrestleMania, as he tends to elevate people more at this PPV. If Corbin doesn't get the same treatment -- as I originally thought Cena costing Corbin the briefcase was to catalyze their feud, which was booked only last week -- we'll know for sure.\n\nWinner: Baron Corbin\n\nKevin Owens vs. AJ Styles (c) with Shane McMahon as the special guest referee for the WWE United States Championship\n\nThis feud was extended far from how it was originally supposed to run, and in the end Styles is walking away with the win and opening himself up to exciting new challengers.\n\nWinner: AJ Styles\n\nShinsuke Nakamura vs. Jinder Mahal (with the Singh Brothers) (c) for the WWE Championship\n\nWhile the easy money is still with Jinder Mahal as WWE still has their upcoming tour of India next month, this is a real test for both men. Mahal had been bogged down by less-than-favorable producing and a tendency by Randy Orton to plod around in the ring, and Shinsuke Nakamura has been getting lukewarm reviews just because of how much of his original style he's holding back. Nakamura should be a better opponent for Mahal, and they both need to go all-out in order for this match to really stand out. If they do, Nakamura's spot on top of the SmackDown roster will be secured, and he'll be winning this championship sooner than later.\n\nWinner: Jinder Mahal\n\nRoman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman vs Samoa Joe vs. Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heyman) (c) in a fatal 4-way for the WWE Universal Championship\n\nThere are only two real possibilities to keep an eye on in this match: either Lesnar keeps his title, or he loses it. After that, if he's losing the title, it's only to two realistic options: Reigns and Samoa Joe. There's a huge chance he's retaining the title, but the whole deal with UFC also successfully muddies up the speculation. If he's losing the championship, I would love for it to be Samoa Joe. But while RAW needs to have the championship back on a weekly basis, there's a nagging feeling tugging at me that says he's keeping the title. I would love to be proved wrong here.\n\nWinner: Brock Lesnar\n\nDamn, guys. We finally got through all of that. 18 matches predicted. Who do you have?

Stone Cold Steve Austin's legendary promo after winning the King of the Ring tournament in 1996. The Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series in 1997. Shane McMahon buying WCW live on RAW in 2001. John Cena beating John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield to win his first WWE Championship at WrestleMania 21. There's been dozens of other such shows in company history -- and it's starting to feel like SummerSlam 2017 is going to be another one of those moments.\n\nWWE has had a problem in recent years of having too many shows that should feel big, but wind up holding too much to the status quo of the time. We've seen shifts and changes, but most of the time they've been slow and gradual, and too often coming too late to make the impact they needed to. This Sunday during SummerSlam, WWE has the chance to effect a lot of change in one night, and while we probably won't see it take every opportunity, there's enough chances here to wind up with a very different landscape than the one we had just a few short weeks ago.\n\nWe already started to see some signs of that change earlier this week, with Akira Tozawa winning the WWE Cruiserweight Championship on RAW in a shocking upset over longtime (and seemingly unbeatable) champion Neville. Then on SmackDown, Baron Corbin tried to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on WWE Champion Jinder Mahal -- only for his bid for glory to get spoiled and wasted by his SummerSlam opponent, John Cena.\n\nBoth men have a chance to make huge statements at SummerSlam -- Tozawa by cementing his first WWE reign by beating Neville again, and Corbin by putting himself firmly on the map of major WWE stars by besting a living legend in Cena to get his revenge.\n\nBut those two are far from the only ones with major opportunities on Sunday. The Fatal Four-Way for the WWE Universal Championship features a pair of wrestlers itching for their first title on the WWE's main roster, with Samoa Joe and Braun Strowman standing as easily two of the best uncrowned wrestlers on the roster. But there's a feeling that if Strowman wins the title, it could kick off the young giant's career in a big, big way and turn him into a true monster in the WWE on a scale we've yet to see from a big man in the company.\n\nAnother big man with the possibility of a big future is Big Cass, who's going one-on-one with one of the most iconic big men in the WWE's history: the Big Show. (Yeah, WWE has a thing for the whole \"Big\" hook.) Cass has slowly morphed into one of RAW's best villains in the last two months after turning on his longtime tag team partner Enzo Amore, and a dominating performance over Big Show with Amore dangling over the ring in a cage could be a real statement of his intent to become one of the biggest stars in the company a lot sooner than people think.\n\nThen there's Finn Balor and Bray Wyatt, two extremely talented wrestlers who have seen their stars fall due to injury and circumstance, respectfully. With Balor's Demon persona expected to emerge for the first time since his shoulder injury exactly one year ago when he won -- then had to quickly vacate -- the Universal Championship, these two could easily put on a classic that vaults both men back up the standings, both in the eyes of fans and those in charge of the WWE.\n\nAlso needing a boost is Rusev, who returns to in-ring action against Randy Orton. Rusev's career once looked bound for greatness, but he's never really recovered from losing his undefeated streak and U.S. Championship to Cena at WrestleMania 31. A win over Orton (who won the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 33 this April) could finally get him back on track and back to being taken seriously as a threat in the WWE. The big Bulgarian has the talent. Now it's just a matter of seizing his opportunity.\n\nAlexa Bliss also has an opportunity at hand to cement herself as a major star in the WWE. Yes, she's already had long reigns with both the RAW and SmackDown Women's Championships -- and is the first performer to hold both -- but she's rarely been seen as a \"real\" champion by many fans given her heel alignment. She's facing a fans' darling in Sasha Banks for her RAW Women's title for the second straight pay-per-view, and another win over the beloved member of WWE's Four Horsewomen would cement Bliss' place as a truly dominant woman in the company.\n\nThis year's SummerSlam has a deep and varied card, but there's one consistent theme throughout it: major opportunities for up-and-coming stars without a ton of time in WWE and some serious chances for guys who need some momentum. Come the end of the night on Sunday, the WWE could look a lot different than it did just one week ago. If it does, it can only be a good thing for a company that needs some shaking up, and it's exciting just to think of the directions it'd be able to go after this weekend.", "dateTime":

There's been so much chatter online that Paul Heyman even worked in some references to Lesnar's potential return to the octagon in his latest promo on RAW Monday night. Heyman has vowed that if Lesnar loses the title in a Fatal Fourway at Summerslam he is leaving the WWE since the match wasn't fair. There have been rumors that Vince McMahon is trying to cut costs and since Lesnar is one of the highest paid athletes on the WWE roster we might be seeing him step away for a while. If Lesnar does lose the belt at Summerslam and takes some time off until Survivor Series or Royal Rumble the WWE has a way to keep fans interested in the meantime-A heel Shield reunion.\n\nDean Ambrose and Seth Rollins have been trying to work out their issues for the past month leading up to Summerslam. On Monday night we finally got the two former Shield members on the same page and they will now face Cesaro and Sheamus for the RAW tag belts on the show. We all know Ambrose and Rollins are going to win and theirs only so much they can do in the RAW tag team division. Wouldn't it be something if they came out to help Reigns win the WWE Universal Title at the end of the night?\n\nWith Braun Strowman, Samoa Joe and Roman Reigns facing Lesnar in the main event it would play out perfectly if Ambrose and Rollins came out to help their Shield brother. Ambrose and Rollins could take out Samoa Joe and Strowman and then help Reigns take out Lesnar. Reigns gets the win and is now the champ. So now the hottest faction in wrestling is back together holding titles as bad guys. Suddenly the absence of Lesnar isn't a big deal as Vince McMahon can turn Joe and Strowman who are getting cheers to babyfaces to face the newly formed Shield for the next few months. The WWE can elevate someone like Finn Balor to team up with Joe and Strowman to battle the big, nasty Shield.\n\nWhat does the WWE have to lose? Ambrose has lost a lot of steam the past two years after he had his legs cut out from under him when he faced Lesnar at Mania two years ago. Rollins is a terrible babyface that does a terrible job of getting fans invested in him as a good guy. Reigns is basically a bad guy anyway despite selling a ton of merchandise at Live Events. Turning them heel would be a smart business decision.\n\nThere have been rumblings that a second roster shakeup is coming in a few weeks and McMahon could move Erik Rowan and/or Luke Harper over to RAW as babyfaces to reform the Wyatt Family with Bray Wyatt and Strowman to face the Shield. Wyatt needs to be turned babyface. He's so good on the mic and with his intros the crowd pops for him no matter how bad he is booked or how long he is booked as a villain. We've see the Wyatts vs Shield a hundred times but we've never seen them go at it with the Wyatts being the good guys and the Shield as the heels.\n\nReuniting \"The Club\" with Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson alongside Finn Balor might be an option as opponents for the Shield. Gallows and Anderson have been handled poorly ever since they lost their initial feud with the Usos when they debuted two years ago. At one point they were red hot but now they are a bad mid-card comedy act. Turning them babyface and sticking them with Balor would create a lot of intrigue, especially to fans who are familiar with them from New Japan and the Bullet Club. If McMahon wanted to get crazy he could send Shinsuke Nakamura and/or AJ Styles to join them in their cause.\n\nRAW has gotten stale and if Lesnar is taking time off McMahon has to do something to keep the product fresh. Luckily he has a Shield reunion in his back pocket. By turning them heel when he does it would make everyone's head explode on Sunday night.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T20:39:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "20:39:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 5}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 4}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 4}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "328739", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "336108", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "score": 4}, {"id": "340549", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dean Ambrose"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Ambrose", "score": 3}, {"id": "340569", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Seth Rollins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rollins", "score": 3}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 4}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 3}, {"id": "349174", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "The Usos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Usos", "score": 1}, {"id": "349175", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bray Wyatt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windham_Rotunda", "score": 2}, {"id": "351140", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 1}, {"id": "358612", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New Japan Pro Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Japan_Pro_Wrestling", "score": 1}, {"id": "365537", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vince McMahon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon", "score": 4}, {"id": "374391", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman", "score": 4}, {"id": "415255", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Balor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balor", "score": 2}, {"id": "422658", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sheamus"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheamus", "score": 3}, {"id": "539987", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Shield (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shield_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "556811", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Antonio Cesaro"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Cesaro", "score": 3}, {"id": "655144", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brodie Lee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodie_Lee", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}, {"id": "1275416", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Karl Anderson and Gallows"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Anderson_and_Gallows", "score": 2}, {"id": "1275615", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Finn B\u00e1lor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_B\u00e1lor", "score": 2}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "20:39:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Summerslam 2017 Needs a Heel Shield Reunion \" AroundTheOctagon.com AroundTheOctagon.com", "originalArticle": null}

Fans saw the big finale as Baron Corbin attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank contract to win Jinder Mahal's championship. However, John Cena was on the apron to interrupt his opportunity, allowing Mahal to get a very quick pinfall to retain his title ahead of SummerSlam 2017. Moments after that happened, fans in the arena got to see another big match with several of the superstars who are involved in Sunday's pay-per-view.\n\nAccording to Sportskeeda, a dark match was held after the show that featured \"The King of Strong Style\" Shinsuke Nakamura and \"The Viper\" Randy Orton. While these two superstars have never officially faced one another in the ring, fans will still have to wait for that. However, the two popular SmackDown stars teamed up for a tag team match. On the other side of the ring was Orton's opponent for Sunday, Rusev, and his tag team partner, Dolph Ziggler. Apparently, Jinder got to take the rest of the night off after back-to-back matches at the end of the show.\n\nIn the dark match, Shinsuke and Orton were able to pick up the win. Reportedly, Orton was able to hit his trademark finisher, the RKO, on Dolph Ziggler. Earlier in the night, Orton hit the move on his upcoming opponent, Rusev. Could this signal that Orton is going to lose on Sunday after gaining the upper hand twice now, or is this simply a warm up for another big win for \"The Viper\" on Sunday?\n\nA fan in attendance captured 45 seconds of video from last night's match at Providence, Rhode Island. In the clip, fans see Orton hit his draping DDT move and then get revved up to hit his finishing move. He pounds the mat and gets the fans going wild, but as he attempted the big move, Rusev enters the ring and delivered the Superkick. Nakamura rushed into the ring to hit Kinsasha on Rusev, clearing him of the ring. Right after that, Dolph Ziggler super-kicked Shinsuke and kicked him out of the ring. That allowed Orton to recover and strike with the RKO, putting Ziggler down for the pinfall.\n\nIt was noted that most of the competitors in the match pretty much \"played it safe\" due to having matches on Sunday. There were no huge spots like leaps off the corner through tables or RKOs through the announcers' table. That's probably smart for the three guys involved in matches on Sunday. As of this report, Ziggler is not scheduled for anything at WWE SummerSlam 2017, but he hasn't been doing a whole lot on SmackDown Live either. As far as Shinsuke Nakamura goes, that's a different story.\n\nNakamura has arguably his biggest match since joining the main roster this coming Sunday as he contends for Jinder Mahal's WWE World Championship. Right now, the Irish sports book Paddy Power has Nakamura as the favorite to win on their betting odds for this Sunday with four to 11 odds. The \"Modern Day Maharaja\" is the underdog at 15 to eight odds for his championship defense at SummerSlam PPV.\n\nA victory by Shinsuke Nakamura seems logical based on WWE currently having several other Japanese champions. Asuka is the longest-reigning NXT Women's Champion. Just this past Monday, Akira Tozawa captured the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. A win by Nakamura allows WWE to promote their stars overseas in another area. A win would also come with an easier night's sleep for \"The King of Strong Style\" knowing that Baron Corbin is no longer carrying around that Money in the Bank briefcase.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T18:46:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "18:46:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "223175", "label": {"eng": "Providence"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Providence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "303298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks", "score": 2}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "310149", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 2}, {"id": "328739", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "score": 4}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 5}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 3}, {"id": "339509", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pin (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 4}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 3}, {"id": "340559", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dolph Ziggler"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolph_Ziggler", "score": 4}, {"id": "340564", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam (2006)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam_(2006)", "score": 1}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 2}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 3}, {"id": "366985", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cutter (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "378642", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Randy Orton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton", "score": 3}, {"id": "426498", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Alexander Rusev"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rusev", "score": 5}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 3}, {"id": "434926", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling tag team match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_tag_team_match_types", "score": 3}, {"id": "448339", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Women's Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Women's_Championship", "score": 1}, {"id": "684004", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Money in the Bank ladder match"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_ladder_match", "score": 4}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 4}], "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wwe-news-randy-orton-shinsuke-nakamura-compete-in-big-match-before-summerslam.jpg", "timeCrawl": "18:46:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Randy Orton & Shinsuke Nakamura In Match After 'SD Live' Ended", "originalArticle": null}

So who will win? Here are the latest \"SummerSlam\" match predictions from the odds.\n\n#Jinder Mahal has been enjoying a decent WWE Championship reign ever since defeating \"The Viper\" Randy Orton at WWE \"Backlash 2017.\" Mahal has managed to escape with rematch victories over Orton, including the recent \"Battleground\" PPV win inside the Punjabi Prison Match.\n\nHowever, Mahal had help from a good friend, the Great Khali, in getting that championship win. He's also got the Singh Brothers constantly roaming the ring to help him out.\n\nFor Shinsuke Nakamura, it's been a quick path straight to the top. He entered the \"SmackDown Live\" roster just after WWE's \"WrestleMania 33\" PPV and now will be competing in his first major championship match several months later. Nakamura has previously captured the WWE NXT Championship several times and looks ready for a run with the WWE's main roster. With a recent win over John Cena, and Cena said to be heading to \"Raw\" for a bit, it seems this is Shinsuke's time to shine.\n\nThis past week's \"SmackDown\" saw John Cena take on Jinder Mahal in a non-title matchup. Cena looked ready to grab a big win ahead of \"SummerSlam,\" but his upcoming opponent Baron Corbin showed up to crash the party.\n\nCorbin hit Cena with the \"Money in the Bank Briefcase\" to cause a disqualification. From there, he asked for the cash in for a title shot. Unfortunately, his previous attack on Cena wasn't enough to put Cena down for good. Cena got up on the apron to cause a distraction, allowing Jinder to get a rollup victory and secure his title. It shocked fans, and now Corbin doesn't seem to have the ability to ruin Sunday's match by cashing in.\n\nBased on the latest betting odds, it's looking like Shinsuke Nakamura may have fortune on his side. There have been wrestling journalists and fans who feel Jinder Mahal hasn't performed suitably enough in the role of a major heel champion. However, WWE was said to be using Mahal to boost their visibility to fans in India.\n\nAccording to the Paddy Power Irish sports book, Nakamura is currently the favorite to win on Sunday with odds of 4 to 9 to win. The underdog will be \"The Modern Day Maharaja\" with odds of 13 to 8 as of this report. So this could mean that the \"blue brand\" gets itself a brand new champion and the reign of the \"King of Strong Style\" begins after \"SummerSlam 2017.\"\n\nWWE fans do you think Nakamura is ready for his first title reign, or should someone else win the title from Jinder Mahal? #Wwe Summerslam", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:11:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373948", "time": "17:11:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 2}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 3}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 3}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 3}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 3}, {"id": "333978", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Job (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 4}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 5}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 3}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 3}, {"id": "354907", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Maharaja"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja", "score": 3}, {"id": "378642", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Randy Orton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton", "score": 3}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 4}, {"id": "564363", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "The Great Khali"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Khali", "score": 3}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 2}], "image": "http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/19/660x290/b_1433x630/will-jinder-mahal-leave-wwes-summerslam-ppv-as-the-wwe-champion-on-sunday-image-via-wweyoutube_1518309.jpg", "timeCrawl": "22:39:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "WWE 'SummerSlam 2017' predictions: Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Jinder Mahal odds", "originalArticle": null}

The fact that this match has been placed on the pre-show perhaps proves the WWE was correct in their decision, allowing them to have more time and potentially a bigger audience. Neville has worked wonders as champion and did deserve a bigger pay off than what he got, which is why this writer believes he will regain the title at the first possible opportunity. This feud has legs to carry on and Tozawa having to regain the belt could be a fun story to tell.\n\nPrediction: Neville\n\nThe New Day (c) vs. The Usos - SmackDown tag-team title match\n\nJL - Considering the epic rap battle that took place featuring music artist Wale just a month ago, it is baffling to see such a high profile match take place on the pre show, especially given the sheer talent of the two teams involved. SmackDown Live has struggled to create a meaningful tag-team division with just The New Day and The Uso's billed as powerful dynamics, while the Samoan twins deserve another run to show their talents, the real narrative should take place between the trio who invented Booty'o's and the returning Breezango in two weeks time.\n\nPrediction: The New Day\n\nMW - What a shame that this match has found itself on the pre show, as this feud has been incredibly entertaining with the match quality to back it up. Everyone involved has incredible talent and both teams could walk away with the championships and be seen as legitimate title holders. The Usos heel turn provided a new lease of life to the tag team and they've hit the ball out of the park since being given legitimate contenders in the form of New Day. As far as the champions are concerned, they too have felt fresher following their break and really being some star power to the blue brand and for that reason alone, this writer thinks they will leave as champions; holding on until some new challengers arise.\n\nPrediction: The New Day\n\nThe Hardy Boyz w/ Jason Jordan vs. The Miz, Bo Dallas & Curtis Axel\n\nJL - Injury struck and forced what could have been a stand alone moment on the show into the 'we'll never know' pile of ideas. The injury to Scott Dawson threw a spanner in the works regarding a potential breakout feud with The Hardys who instead team with Jason Jordan to take on The Miz, Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel in a six-man tag-team match. A meaningless match but one that will keep the crowd happy given the feel good factor that the brothers from can bring, and a win they may need if the 'deletion' is upon us.\n\nPrediction: The Hardy & Jason Jordan\n\nMW - A match thrown together at the last minute to get several people on the card. It seems strange that the Intercontinental Champion wouldn't be in a featured match and the same can be said for Jason Jordan considering his push through his Kurt Angle storyline. The Hardy Boyz were expected to face The Revival but an injury prevented that taking place and it is no surprise to see them put on the show due to their popularity. Because there is no real story here, expect to see the baby faces win with either Bo Dallas or Curtis Axel taking the fall.\n\nPrediction: Hardyz/Jason Jordan\n\nMain Card\n\nThe Big Show vs. Big Cass (w/ Enzo Amore in a shark cage)\n\nJL - One day, the WWE Universe will look back on the career of The Big Show and wish they never chanted \"Please Retire\" - especially considering the phenomenal shape the giant has got himself into. However, there factors in this match have left a sour taste in the mouths of many, with the storyline really about Enzo Amore needing a big man to get revenge on Big Cass. With the veteran suffering from an injured hand, its unlikely he will be able to floor his equally tall opponent, giving him a monumental win over a legend at The Biggest Party of the Summer.\n\nPrediction: Big Cass\n\nMW - The battle of the 'bigs,' that also involves a shark cage to trap a baby face, for some reason. None of this is exciting to me and personally, this writer will be happy when it's over. Big Cass has done well in his role but two men of their size battling never leads to a classic and whilst Big Show has tried, the WWE seems very confused over Enzo Amore's future. A defeat here would derail Cass' push and a Big Show win isn't needed for the veteran, this should be routine.\n\nPrediction- Big Cass\n\nNaomi (c) vs. Natalya - SmackDown Women's title match\n\nJL- The dancing and the gimmick of Naomi has kept her in the spotlight, sorry 'glowlight', for longer than expected, and while she got her WrestleMania moment, her talent and charisma have been kept locked away and her pairing with Natalya has raised eyebrows. With a hugely talented locker room, the Blue Brand can boast a number of imposing figures for the Women's Championship - but how many times can Natalya be so close, yet so far?\n\nPrediction: Natalya\n\nMW- Both of these ladies are very talented in the ring, but for some reason this feud just hasn't connected the way that is should have. Probably because the amount of interaction between them has been poor, with WWE spending plenty of time on other members of the roster instead. With both Charlotte and Becky Lynch rebuilding their status as of late, the shadow of the Four Horsewomen ladies still looms over everyone and it because of that, one of those ladies will be the ones to take the title when the time comes.\n\nPrediction- Naomi\n\nCesaro & Sheamus (c) vs. Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins - RAW tag-team title match\n\nJL - The child inside is struggling to contain itself, with the possibility of The Shield reuniting fully down the line, the taste of Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins teaming up is enough to salivate for now. However, can the pair truly stay on the same page? Ambrose has rejected Rollins, and vice versa , showing that tension still lingers inside both of these stars, will a loss to the tag-team champs set up a feud for the pair?\n\nPrediction: Cesaro & Sheamus\n\nMW- This one is a dark horse to be match of the night in this writers opinion. The amount of star power in this match is incredible and the story that has been told is gripping with the former Shield brothers slowly regaining trust for each other, all leading to this point. Sheamus and Cesaro have done a great job as champions, something nobody expected at the start of their best of seven series; proving sometimes fans need to have more trust and patience. This match should be great with plenty of near falls and likely a tease that Rollins and Ambrose can't work together. A lot of people have speculated at an Ambrose heel turn and whilst this writer believes that is the eventual aim; this would be too soon. The potential turn can easily be stretched out and having the Shield brothers just miss out on the titles at SummerSlam would he the next logical step; they can claim the gold (or silver) later down the line before the betrayal takes place.\n\nPrediction- Sheamus & Cesaro\n\nAlexa Bliss (c) vs. Sasha Banks - RAW Women's Title match\n\nJL- First off, its a shame to see Bayley's chance to redeem herself taken away due to injury, but its a pleasure to see Sasha Banks thrust into the limelight against an equally sassy opponent. Both of these females can bring out the best in each other with reports of real tension between the pair. The Boss has showed she is one of the top women in the company and Bliss has been the breakout star of the division over the past year, seeing her flourish has been a sight to behold and this should not be the time for The Goddess to give up her throne; just yet.\n\nPrediction - Alexa Bliss\n\nMW - Even though it is a shame that Bayley got injured as nobody wants to see talent hurt, we have finally found our way back to this point and the match that should have always been booked for SummerSlam. Their is a built in feud between Alexa Bliss and Sasha Banks and this writer is very pleased that it is going to continue here. Sadly they didn't get as much out of the feud as possible due to the fact Bayley was originally in the match, but this should be a fun one and as both women work well together. Bliss' run has been entertaining as champion, but with the amount of heels of the roster that could get a shot such as Emma and Nia Jax, passing the belt to Banks feels like the correct decision, to open up the roster to new feuds rather than repeats.\n\nPrediction- Sasha Banks\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\nJL- This match got interesting fast. Alls it takes is a storyline and a bucket of blood to get fans interested in Bray Wyatt again and pairing him with a superstar with a dark past such as Finn Balor has created a beautiful narrative. The Eater of Worlds will have awoken something inside of The Irishman that he may come to regret but for the WWE Universe it will be a sight to behold.\n\nPrediction: Finn Balor\n\nMW - The match that everybody was screaming for when Finn Balor debuted his 'demon' back in NxT and is currently set to be lost in the shuffle when it finally takes place. That is the sad reality of just how far Bray Wyatt's character has fallen, but with that said both men have worked hard to make this entertaining. Of course it is wacky and over the top but that is wrestling and that is what these characters are. The return of Balor's demon will provide a fun spectacle, although it should have been kept as a surprise. In terms of predictions, this is likely another case of Bray Wyatt's actions never backing up his words, which will lead to a Balor victory.\n\nPrediction- Finn Balor\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev\n\nJL - While the always special RKO outta' nowhere is a graceful and elegant surprise for the WWE Universe, a meaningless Randy Orton victory is anything but. Since returning a month ago Rusev has shown once again why he has achieved a mountain of support, and as WWE Champion Jinder Mahal shown, you can't stay buried forever. The Viper may have got the best of the Brute on the go home edition of the blue brand, but he may have a major victory over Orton come their match at SummerSlam.\n\nPrediction: Rusev\n\nMW - Since his return the Bulgarian Brute has been given opportunities to work with two of the biggest names in the history of the business. Whilst the outcome of his match with John Cena was expected; this one is tougher to predict. Do WWE want to build a future star, or will they look to use this feud as a method to give randy orton his momentum back following his Jinder Mahal defeats? It's a feud that can easily continue following on from SummerSlam, working as a upper mid card rivalry for future PPV's and for that a Rusev victory (not cleanly) would be best.\n\nPrediction- Rusev\n\nBaron Corbin vs. John Cena\n\nJL - Much like the Balor - Wyatt match, this bout got a whole lot more interesting following the events of the go-home edition of their respective shows. A failed cash in, an unsuccessful once in a life time opportunity, all thanks to John Cena, only infuriating an already angry Baron Corbin. While opinions may see this as another 'burial' it may be the complete opposite, a resurrection if you will. A victory over the 16-time World Champion carries a lot of weight and may mean a deserved title opportunity should he succeed.\n\nPrediction: Baron Corbin\n\nMW - Well, this match got a whole lot more interesting following this weeks episode of SmackDown Live. Before it appeared to be a way of throwing both men on the card, yet now it could be the most physical match of the night due to John Cena costing Baron Corbin his chance to become WWE Champion. Even though it is a shame to see the Money in the Bank briefcase wasted, hope is not lost for Corbin; but a defeat on Sunday could see his future put in a bleak position. On the other hand, a victory over the face of the company will put him right back in the championship picture and people will have no further reason to complain.\n\nPrediction: Baron Corbin\n\nAJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens - United States title match, Shane McMahon special guest referee\n\nJL - Twists, turns and Shane McMahon, this rivalry has had it all. Styles puts his United States title on the line against Kevin Owens with Shane McMahon as the special guest referee, with the 47-year-old promising to retaliate is either superstar places their hands on him. The stipulation presents itself in a suggestive way, and given that The Prizefighter has a history with the SmackDown commissioner, it seems fitting that he would inadvertently help his former foe claim back what he believes is rightfully his.\n\nPrediction: Kevin Owens\n\nJinder Mahal (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura - WWE Championship match\n\nJL- The current tagline for Jinder Mahal's WWE Championship reign should be, he's not bad but he's not great. While his opponent, has been underwhelming, the talent that Shinsuke Nakamura possesses is incredible, but with him only showing a glimpse of what he is capable of. His time in Japan is fondly remembered, while his current tenure in the United States has been reported as 'restricted'. Would a championship unlock his full skillset? Probably not, and with him not showing his true potential, may be the time should be delayed for him to pick up his first title on the main roster. With Mahal boasting the Singh Bros as his bonus cards, The Artist has much more to deal with than just one man.\n\nPrediction: Jinder Mahal\n\nMW - Who would have thought a year ago that this would be the WWE Championship match at SummerSlam? If you could have predicted this, then you deserve a medal! This match certainly won't be in the running for match of the year, but Shinsuke Nakamura is certainly capable of incredible things and Jinder Mahal works hard in every match which could lead to a surprise in the quality. Jinder Mahal's title run, whilst refreshing, hasn't fully delivered and the chance to really get behind Nakamura has created itself and seeing the rock star leave as champion would be an incredible sight.\n\nPrediction: Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nBrock Lesnar (c) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Brawn Strowman vs. Samoa Joe - Universal Title match\n\nJL - Everyone has a favourite in this match, and there seems to be so much more on the line for one man in particular, with the narrative possibly spoiling the outcome. While many behind the scenes are pushing for Samoa Joe to steal the title, the likelihood remains that Brock Lesnar will walk out of the Barclays Center with his title intact. The stipulation suggested that if the former UFC Heavyweight champion were to lose, he would leave WWE, this was following a call out by current UFC Light Heavyweight champ Jon Jones, sparking speculation about his future. Currently Lesnar is set to leave after WrestleMania 34, and the chances of him holding the Universal Title until that point are strong.\n\nPrediction: Brock Lesnar\n\nMW- This year WWE has created one of it's strongest PPV main events in months for SummerSlam with four genuine contenders that all have a claim to the championship. This match has a big fight feel and is unpredictable because of that which always makes a main event more entertaining. With the rumours that Brock Lesnar is set to leave WWE people have quickly become even more interested, but this writer doesn't believe he will be dropping the belt here and Lesnar will pull of a shock and walk away the way he went in; the champion.\n\nPrediction - Brock Lesnar", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T23:57:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "23:57:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "113", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 4}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 5}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

He has been nigh unbeatable since returning to professional wrestling in 2012. He ended the Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania. His time as UFC heavyweight champion gives him legitimate fighting credibility that most wrestlers can't match.\n\nBut as Lesnar prepares to defend the WWE Universal Championship at SummerSlam on Sunday, do all his extracurriculars add to his aura of invincibility, or make him surprisingly vulnerable? Newly crowned UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones is talking up a super fight with Lesnar, and WWE has already hinted that bout could affect the story it's telling with Lesnar and the championship.\n\nTo sort all this out, Inverse partnered with Unanimous A.I. to enlist a swarm of more than 30 of our wrestling fan readers to predict how Lesnar will fare Sunday. As you can see in the animation below, each participant controlled a little golden magnet and used it to drag the puck toward the answer they thought was the most likely outcome. Also, the closer a user puts the magnet to the puck, the greater the pulling force. This is where the hive-mind comes in: As the user sees the puck move toward an outcome, it triggers a psychological response. The user starts to readjust their decision-making, building toward a consensus.\n\nSo then, in the fatal four-way match between Brock Lesnar, Braun Strowman, Roman Reigns, and Samoa Joe, who does our swarm think will emerge victorious?\n\nThat was pretty definitive! You can see initial pockets of support for each of the challengers, with Strowman appearing to lose support first. But the hive-mind quickly settles on Lesnar retaining. What's a little stranger is how the swarm thinks Jon Jones will figure into SummerSlam, where he's been rumored to make some sort of appearance. With his role ranging from no-show to active interference in Lesnar's title match, the swarm decided to go big.\n\nAgain, you can see the magnets initially pulling in all directions, but the consensus quickly breaks in favor of Jones full-on interfering in the match. Let's leave aside the very reasonable question of whether the UFC would actually allow Jones to be so involved in the show, even if it is to promote what should be a massively lucrative fight between him and Lesnar. What's really intriguing here is the same swarm picked Lesnar to win and Jones to interfere. Our hive-mind either thinks Jones would get involved to help Lesnar win -- perhaps UFC allegiance trumps all? -- or they believe Lesnar is so strong he could overcome even Jones's attempts to screw him over. Given how WWE has treated Lesnar since his return, that's not impossible.\n\nTo read more about how Unanimous A.I. uses swarm A.I. to reach scarily accurate predictions, check out our previous article on how Unanimous A.I. uses \"swarm intelligence\" to make predictions.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T19:29:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "19:29:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "304132", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "score": 3}, {"id": "304392", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "score": 3}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 4}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 5}, {"id": "307271", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Force"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force", "score": 3}, {"id": "309947", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Magnet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet", "score": 4}, {"id": "309979", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "score": 4}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 2}, {"id": "330445", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "score": 4}, {"id": "331124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Swarm behaviour"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour", "score": 4}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 2}, {"id": "336108", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "score": 3}, {"id": "340565", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "The Undertaker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undertaker", "score": 4}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 4}, {"id": "346524", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions", "score": 5}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 2}, {"id": "508754", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Group mind (science fiction)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 2}, {"id": "1277085", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Streak (wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streak_(wrestling)", "score": 4}], "image": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/2a/e2/95/8c/8121/4737/a7cb/e8ec30621541/brock-lesnar-and-his-advocate-paul-heyman.jpeg?rect=0%2C35%2C900%2C450&fm=png&w=1200", "timeCrawl": "01:44:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "\"Swarm A.I.\" Predicts Brock Lesnar Will Win Big At SummerSlam", "originalArticle": null}

This weekend's pay-per-view could hold the answer.\n\nPro wrestling is fantasy. It's not sword-and-sorcery, but it's fantasy nonetheless. And while no one (present company excepted) would accuse WWE of wielding metaphor as a weapon in the manner that epic fantasy sometimes does, it reflects our culture in a much more insidious manner, putting on a sideshow mirror version of our ids and superegos, our visceral angst, in the form of campy brawling. If at times I have read too much into the meaning of pro wrestling, it's because (1) the art inherently asks as much of the audience as the performers, and (2) because I want it to be more than it is.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the plight of the wrestling fan, and the reason the source of our great disappointment is our own expectations. Wrestling doesn't have the prestige of scripted television or the plausible deniability of real sports, and so our confidence as fans in the product is inherently skewed. We want it to be better, and it's always easy enough to imagine a better way forward -- or what seems like one, anyway.\n\nOn my podcast last week, I fantasy-booked an ending to SummerSlam. It wasn't brilliant, but it made a perfect sort of sense. Frankly, I wish I hadn't said it, because now I'm the tout who predicted the long-shot win, and anything else will be a disappointment. That's not quite the right metaphor, though, because fantasy booking isn't predicting the outcome of pro wrestling -- it's hoping for it. It's a second-level meta-contest between the WWE creative team and fans who think they can do it better. [Ahem.] We'll get to my proposal in a second, but first a bit of background.\n\nFour years ago, the Shield -- Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, and Dean Ambrose -- were the most popular faction in WWE. They split up when Seth Rollins joined the Authority, the evil establishment group. Seth went the way of evil; Ambrose put on jeans and began a Steve Austin-lite comedic run; and Reigns kept the trappings (and, theoretically, the mystique) of the Shield and was shoved into the main event spotlight. Since then, Rollins got hurt and turned babyface; Ambrose won the WWE championship, lost it, and fizzled, or vice versa; and Reigns became the most contemptible \"star\" of the company since John Cena at his \"Cena Sucks\" peak. All of this bears mention because two of the most popular fantasy-booking ideas are (1) a three-way battle between the former Shieldsters for the title, and, more importantly, (2) the reunion of the Shield. In the present, Ambrose and Rollins (who battled extensively after their breakup) have formed an uneasy alliance to go after the Raw tag titles, currently held by Sheamus and Cesaro. Meanwhile, Reigns is one of four -- along with Brock Lesnar, Braun Strowman, and Samoa Joe -- wrestlers contending for the WWE Universal title.\n\nSo here's my pitch: Rollins and Ambrose win, and the crowd goes wild. Then, in the main event, they interfere to help Reigns win the title, and the Brooklyn crowd turns on them, reforming the Shield as the biggest heel faction this side of the nWo. As good as he quietly has become, Reigns is symbolic of WWE's inorganic booking decisions, and the crowd has fully turned on him. (And to his credit, he's embraced the hate in a way Cena never fully did.) If he were to win on Sunday, the audience would boo the show into oblivion. If Rollins and Ambrose -- who have themselves both failed to find their footing as headline babyfaces -- helped him, the fans would still flip out. But instead of booing WWE, as they'd be doing if Reigns won clean, they'd be booing Rollins and Ambrose for abetting the win fans were dreading. They'd be booing WWE's newest heel faction. The SummerSlam crowd would be throwing trash like it was Bash at the Beach '96. Instead of going home disenchanted, we'd be going home angry.\n\nThat's good booking. Or at least, I think so. And of course I do, because it's my idea.\n\nThis is the real problem with fantasy booking. Reality can never meet the expectations of imagination. If 100 Reddit commenters have better ideas for how Jon Snow should get to Eastwatch, they could never agree on a replacement, and yet they'll all be disappointed in what happens on Game of Thrones this week. It's not a knock on fandom -- it's one of the perils of consciousness. If you care enough about something, it's easy to talk yourself into hating it. This has become the core of wrestling fandom. It's like that saying -- the opposite of love isn't hate; it's going out to a bar on Monday night without caring that your DVR is broken.\n\nBut sometimes, reality has a way of fantasy booking on its own. Take Sunday's Raw women's championship match between Alexa Bliss and Sasha Banks. A month ago, Bayley won the right to challenge Bliss for the belt. Bayley's run on Raw has been a dud since she debuted last July. She rose to renown in NXT as the underdog who finally made it to the top, but she was introduced on Raw as a conquering hero. With her hugs, side ponytail, neon colorways, and nuclear earnestness, she's a magnet for the young girl demo, and she should have a firm place in WWE. But the company should have run back the underdog story line and made her earn her fandom on the main roster, because as Daniel Bryan she's fantastic, but as the Ultimate Warrior she's been a dull thud.\n\nWhen Bayley won the no. 1 contendership, it felt like there had to be another shoe to drop -- not only was Bayley's mediocrity apparent, but we were a mere month removed from a very good battle between Bliss and Banks at Great Balls of Fire that begged for a rematch. Apparently WWE wasn't planning for a sequel, but when Bayley hurt her shoulder during a collision with the ring apron, it was forced to scramble, putting the title shot up for grabs in a tournament of all the women on Raw, and Banks came out on top. It's like the universe heard the message boards groan and corrected course.\n\nIt's not always the universe making changes, though -- sometimes it's WWE. WWE bigwigs like to say that they can test-market their product five nights a week -- every time they put on a show in front of an audience. And even though it can seem like they're hearing what they want to hear, sometimes they respond to crowd boredom. (It should be said that the difference between what WWE hears and what it seems like fans want has a lot to do with the difference between the more forgiving fans at house shows and the snarky ones at Monday Night Raw, though that doesn't change the perception for the at-home viewer that WWE's pet projects are poorly received.) On Monday, WWE added a broken hand to the broken Big Show-Big Cass feud; swapped the cruiserweight title from Neville to challenger Akira Tozawa, giving some much-needed heat to what was already a rematch from a month ago; and raised the stakes (or the gore, anyway) of Finn B\u00e1lor vs. Bray Wyatt when the latter dumped a \"viscous acidic liquid of some sort\" -- fake blood by literally any other name -- over the former's head.\n\nOver on SmackDown, the main event picture -- previously occupied by a Randy Orton-Jinder Mahal feud that felt like a months-long Aristocrats routine, but with the Great Khali instead of scatology -- has been reinvigorated by the return of John Cena and the absolutely unthinkable ouster of Cena by newcomer Shinsuke Nakamura. When Nakamura takes on Mahal on Sunday for the WWE championship, and Cena deigns to give a platform to Baron Corbin, match quality will take a backseat to the sheer implausibility of the matchmaking. Two weeks ago, when Nakamura (legitimately) suplexed Cena onto his head, it might as well have been a metaphor for a creative team-wide concussion, because something had to be rattling around upstairs to defy expectations to such an extent. (That something is probably WWE's ongoing march into the Asian market, but it's nice to think the Reddit market is suddenly getting a fair hearing too.)\n\nOf course, for everybody who's excited that Nakamura or Banks is getting such an opportunity, there's probably someone who fantasy-booked someone else into that spot. The grating chorus of online wrestling fandom is that [insert favorite wrestler's name here] is being buried -- a.k.a. being held back irrationally by the WWE decision-makers. And even though sometimes this is true, more often than not it's a hollow argument, a way to validate general angst. And regardless, if you define \"burial\" as absence from the main event, then it's the very nature of the sport that 90 percent of the roster is getting buried at any moment. The inevitable endpoint of these arguments is that every PPV would end up with a battle royale wherein all the wrestlers that somebody somewhere likes would duke it out for the top prize. And one Royal Rumble a year is enough.\n\nAll of which is to say that the main event on Sunday's show is at its core a glorious schmozz, a test-marketed meat locker with a cow marinated for every palate. The defending champ is Brock Lesnar, the former UFC heavyweight who conveys an air of legitimacy (despite a middling attendance record) to the fake sport. His three challengers represent the separate blocs of WWE fandom: Reigns represents the kids-and-women demo, the John Cena voters; Samoa Joe represents the indie snobs and highbrow purists; and Braun Strowman is the delegate from the reptilian brain, the endlessly powerful part of wrestling fandom that never tires of muscular spectacle, growling voices, and full-on commitment to farce. (The fact that all four guys are nominally heels is beside the point. They don't need to tell us who to root for because we know who represents our tastes without them putting their sunglasses on the kid in the front row.) Vince McMahon famously detests multi-party main events, so the very fact of the four contestants makes the bout feel slightly crowd-sourced. But that's the wonder of it: it's a fantasy-booking Frankenstein's monster.\n\nThe most straightforward feud on the card is probably AJ Styles vs. Kevin Owens, and the very existence of both of them in the WWE is proof that fantasy can come true. A couple of years ago, they existed in WWE only in messageboard fantasy booking -- the kind that was so implausible that you just groaned. Now they're such a part of the fabric of WWE that Shane McMahon is the special guest referee -- a cog in the Owens-Styles machine -- and it feels perfectly normal.\n\nThat's where we are in WWE in 2017, and specifically at SummerSlam. As much as we fans love to counterprogram in our minds, this event is a pretty good representation of the hopes and dreams of the fan base. Maybe it's because we fantasy-booking types are finally the majority. If the volume of jeers that Reigns gets is any indication, \"we're all smarks now\" isn't overstatement. Maybe our fantasy is becoming reality.\n\nBut WWE still has to put on the show. And it still has to decide who wins in the end. Because it's easy enough to fantasy-book a main event match and make everyone happy -- the hard part is booking the finish. In a four-person match like this, you're going to disappoint three-quarters of the audience with whatever ending you choose. If Strowman loses, the unyielding ascent of the WWE's lovable monster hits its end in a weirdly insignificant way. If Joe loses, the strains of \"he's getting buried\" might break the internet. If Lesnar loses, he's (in story line) quitting WWE, but it's not exactly the dream match ending WWE surely had in mind when it put the belt back on him. If Reigns loses, well, that sort of makes sense.\n\nThat's why my vote is for Reigns, because a Reigns win is the only ending guaranteed to disappoint the most people.

When he came back earlier in July, WWE described him as a free agent.\n\nSpeaking with Complex last month, Cena said he wanted to be a free agent because he is not sure whether he will be available for Raw or Smackdown. He also talked about a possible retirement in the near future.\n\n\"I just turned 40 in April and we have so many young and talented performers, I don't know how many years I have left,\" he added. \"So in the time I have left, I'm gonna do what I can to dedicate to this company. I just want to be able to do it the most time that I possibly can.\"'\n\nMeanwhile, Lesnar might be returning to UFC soon. His manager Paul Heyman hinted that the WWE champion could be making his comeback to the cage after SummerSlam.

Natalya is squaring off against Trinity Fatu in an attempt to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. While the Queen of Harts has been consistently winning recent matches, Natalya could be the one to finally end her reign.\n\nJinder Mahal is fighting Shinsuke Nakamura for the championship match, and there are speculations that the latter will finally snag the former's title. Bleacher Report points out that Nakamura is now as popular as any SmackDown star. He is expected to win the title at some point, so it might as well be given to him during the SummerSlam event.\n\nFansided notes that a title run for Nakamura can open a lot of exciting twists, since it will certainly stir up feuds with AJ Styles, Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens. The Japanese standout's victory could bring more fun and entertainment as he defends his title.\n\n\"This is going to be an interesting one. Jinder is just coming into his own. It's funny that people can say that all of a sudden Jinder is what he is,\" Triple H told ESPN, referring to Mahal and Nakamura's match.\n\nAs for Mahal's opponent, the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) star said he should not be underestimated. Triple H also praised Nakamura's one-of-a-kind style. \"Shinsuke brings something to the table that few guys can bring,\" he explained. \"He brings this crazy, unique character that I don't think there's been anything like him, but then he just kicks the crap out of you. It's just his style.\"\n\nWWE \"SummerSlam\" 2017 kicks off on Sunday, Aug. 20, at 7 p.m. EDT.

This means that it's highly likely that fans will be seeing more than one title change on Sunday night, but the question is, which WWE stars will be walking away with championship gold at SummerSlam?\n\nSheamus and Cesaro will be defending the WWE Raw Tag Team Titles against Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins in what is arguably one of the most anticipated matches on the card. Ambrose and Rollins have been on a rocky road as of late as they try to repair their relationship in a post-Shield world, but they certainly seemed to be on the same page Monday on Raw.\n\nThe Boston crowd popped big time when Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins finally bumped fists, so it's safe to say that the Brooklyn crowd would blow the roof off the Barclays Center if Rollins and Ambrose walk away with the belts, and it seems likely to happen at this point.\n\nCBS recently put together an article where several wrestling insiders picked their winners for SummerSlam, and Rollins and Ambrose seem to be the favorites across the board.\n\nSo will Ambrose and Rollins become the new Raw Tag Team Champions on Sunday? It seems like the answer is yes, as this team is white hot right now and current odds heavily favor the challengers to walk out with the belts. Not to mention it would give SummerSlam a much needed feel good moment.\n\nShinsuke Nakamura impressed wrestling fans a few weeks ago when he was able to beat John Cena clean on SmackDown Live, and now he's heading to SummerSlam where he will challenge Jinder Mahal for the WWE Championship.\n\nMany fans were speculating that this would be the match where Baron Corbin cashes in his Money in the Bank briefcase, but after Corbin cashed in and failed to win the title on SmackDown Live, that's no longer an option.\n\nAs Sports Betting Dime notes, WWE has kept the belt on Jinder Mahal in an attempt to grow their fanbase in India. However, it doesn't seem as if their attempts have been as profitable as the company may have hoped.\n\nIt seems that it's time for Mahal to drop the title, and even though odds could shift right before the pay-per-view, the odds currently favor Shinsuke Nakamura to walk away with his first WWE Championship on Sunday.\n\nIf you're looking for title changes, these are the matches to keep an eye on. Even though odds could shift at any time, it seems that the other champions are currently favored to retain their respective titles.\n\nWhich champions do you think will be losing their titles on Sunday?

The event will be broadcast on pay-per-view and streamed on the WWE Network starting at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nHere are the top matches taking place at SummerSlam and our predicted winners:\n\nBrock Lesnar (champion) vs. Roman Regins vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman in a Fatal 4-Way Match for the Universal Championship.\n\nThe most unpredictable of the matches taking place Sunday, each competitor has a fair chance at taking home Raw's top prize. Reigning champion Brock Lesnar and his advocate Paul Heyman have threatened in recent weeks to leave the WWE if The Beast loses due to the odds stacked against him. With Lesnar rumored to be headed back to the UFC for a potential fight against Jon Jones, a new champion will most likely be crowned here.\n\nDue to Samoa Joe's impressive display against Lesnar at Great Balls of Fire, The Destroyer barely edges out Reigns and Strowman as a potential winner who only needs to lock in his fabled Coquina Clutch submission maneuver onto any of the competitors to win the match.\n\nPredicted winner: Samoa Joe\n\nJinder Mahal (champion) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the WWE Championship\n\nDespite Shinsuke Nakamura's impressive win over John Cena recently to earn this championship match, the odds may prove too difficult for WWE's resident Rockstar to overcome as Jinder Mahal will once again be backed by his henchmen, The Singh Brothers. Always willing to do whatever it takes to win, including enlisting the help of past champions, Mahal will once again cheat his way to victory among a chorus of boos.\n\nPredicted winner: Jinder Mahal\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nCorbin will be out for blood Cena's blood since he ruined his chance at becoming WWE Champion Tuesday on Smackdown when he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. Cena, who has repeatedly embarrassed The Lone Wolf, keeps a busy schedule outside of WWE and may be headed toward another sabbatical. There is also the fact that Cena announced in July that he is a free agent able to compete on either Raw or Smackdown to consider as he may move onto the red brand in the near future to face new challengers. This makes Corbin the likely winner as WWE will want him to look strong as he attempts to climb back into the championship picture on Tuesday nights.\n\nPredicted winner: Baron Corbin\n\nAJ Styles (champion) vs. Kevin Owens for the United States Championship with Shane McMahon as the special guest referee\n\nA special guest referee always equals some type of shenanigans taking place in a match and this will be no different. Expect Shane McMahon to get involved physically in this bout and for the Smackdown commissioner to use his power in order to select and favor either AJ Styles or Kevin Owens to win the match. Destined to feud with the loser, and with McMahon having already faced Styles at WrestleMania, The Phenomenal One will win setting up a future confrontation between McMahon and Owens.\n\nPredicted winner: AJ Styles\n\nCesaro and Sheamus (champions) vs. Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins for the Raw Tag Team Championship\n\nThere is no stopping this Shield reunion between Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins that has been building up for weeks. The Hounds of Justice are back and will prove too formidable for Cesaro and Sheamus as WWE looks to bring back one the most popular factions of all time. With championship gold around their waist, perhaps afterwards Ambrose and Rollins will approach Roman Reigns about rejoining their ranks as well.\n\nPredicted winners: Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins\n\nNaomi (champion) vs. Natalya for the Smackdown Women's Championship\n\nNaomi's feel-good championship run shows no signs of slowing down and she has yet to face the other women present on the Smackdown roster making her the favorite to win. The most exciting thing about this match, however, is that Carmella will be waiting in the wings with her Money in the Bank briefcase. There is no better time than SummerSlam for The Princess of Staten Island to cash in on a depleted Naomi and become the new Smackdown Women's Champion.\n\nPredicted winner: Naomi, followed by Carmella cashing her Money in the Bank briefcase to become the new Smackdown Women's Champion\n\nAlexa Bliss (champion) vs. Sasha Banks for the Raw Women's Championship\n\nSasha Banks is acting as a replacement here for Bayley who has been forced to miss out on SummerSlam due to injury. This makes Alexa Bliss the easy favorite to win as she moves on to feud with Nia Jax who has remained in the championship picture.\n\nPredicted winner: Alexa Bliss\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\nBray Wyatt has awakened Finn Balor's demon persona which will be out in full force at SummerSlam much to the Eater of Worlds' dismay. After losing to Wyatt recently on Raw, Balor will come out victorious at SummerSlam, however, Sunday will serve as just the latest chapter in this feud that will continue on for at least another month.\n\nPredicted winner: Finn Balor\n\nSummerSlam will also feature Smackdown Tag Team Champions The New Day defending their titles against The Usos; Randy Orton taking on Rusev; Big Show facing off against Big Cass with Enzo Amore suspended above the ring in a shark cage; Cruiserweight Champion Akira Tozawa defending his title against Neville; and The Hardy Boyz with Jason Jordan battling Intercontinental Champion The Miz and his Miztourage.\n\nThe writing is on the wall...\n\nDon't miss @WWE @SummerSlam, streaming LIVE THIS SUNDAY at 7e/4p only on @WWENetwork! #SummerSlam pic.twitter.com/0uyLJB1RF6 -- WWE (@WWE)\n\nAugust 17, 2017", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T13:09:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 7, "textStart": 0, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 5751, "textStart": 5736, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.572549045085907, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "13:09:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

Provided the fans aren't burned out by the long run time (which would be a story in and of itself), Lesnar, Strowman, Reigns and Joe should be able to give the fans a fun championship match. \"It's amusing that people can say that all of a sudden Jinder is what he is\", Triple H told ESPN, referring to Mahal and Nakamura's match. Nakamura's strong style is new to WWE fans but not to wrestling fans as a whole. The big victor here could be the fans, as major ring entrances are expected for both men.\n\nNakamura winning or losing can both be good business, but can't see WWE bringing him this far without him getting the belt. Naomi's light show entrance should be wonderful. The catch here is that Money in the Bank contract holder Carmela could well cash in during or after this match and steal the thunder. AJ Styles is the odds on favorite to retain the US Title, and Sasha Banks and Alexa Bliss are pretty much neck and neck when it comes to the RAW Women's Title.\n\n\"One of my first goals was a 'WrestleMania, ' a world title, wrestle all of the superstars\", Nakamura said, who named Randy Orton as someone he'd like to work with. This one is a coin toss, as ideal booking has left us guessing who could come out on top. It could be a way to build towards a Team Shane vs. Team Owens match at Survivor Series.\n\nShane has already fought Styles and there is recent tension between Owens and McMahon.\n\nThese two teams have had tremendous chemistry lately, starting at Battleground, where The New Day won their first SmackDown tag-team titles. This should be an excellent match bell to bell.\n\nPrediction: New champs. WWE knows it can make money with Ambrose and Rollins as a team. This is an example of tag-team wrestling at its best.\n\nJohn Cena -167 vs Baron Corbin +120. This doesn't help Rusev, who will go grounded into SmackDown Live.\n\nThis year's SummerSlam has a deep and varied card, but there's one consistent theme throughout it: major opportunities for up-and-coming stars without a ton of time in WWE and some serious chances for guys who need some momentum.\n\nThough the Big Cass and Enzo Amore feud started decently enough, it crumbled when you realize that (a) Enzo really is the weak link and (b) Cass isn't all that great on his own.\n\nAs WWE Summerslam 2017 is a Pay-Per-View event, audiences in the United Kingdom will have to pay \u00a319.95 on SkyBox Office either live or on repeat.

Take a look below and see what the superstars of SmackDown Live have in store for Sunday.\n\nThere are two obvious questions here: First, is Styles going to retain the title he has taken from Owens twice since the beginning of July? And second, how will special guest referee Shane McMahon factor into the result?\n\nWe'll start with the second question first. Clearly there's been a good amount of build and not-so-subtle hints that McMahon, the SmackDown Commissioner by day, is willing to, uh, overstep his referee responsibilities and engage in any pugilistic activities with whoever might lay a hand on him, whether it's Owens or Styles.\n\nAlso, McMahon doesn't exactly have a history of being an impartial ref. Look no further than his antics when he refused to give Stone Cold Steve Austin the three count against Mankind at Survivor Series. Granted, that was 19 years ago, but we were starkly reminded of that by KO at SmackDown a couple of weeks ago.\n\nSo, Shane, are you going to call this one down the middle? Probably not.\n\nOwens and Styles have been intertwined in various storylines since the Superstar shakeup in April. But the real heat began at Battleground, when Owens pinned Styles for the title, only to lose it two days later. Conventional thinking suggests Styles will come out on top, with McMahon possibly playing a role in the outcome, thus setting up a feud with Owens. But as we've seen in this rivalry, nothing seems to go as planned, especially when you have titles between the two changing at house shows.\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nNot a single person will enter SummerSlam with more regret than Corbin, not after he failed to cash in his briefcase Tuesday and walk away with gold.\n\nA devious plan to leverage his free shot for the title backfired when Corbin went to pin a seemingly down-and-out Jinder Mahal, only for the champ to collect himself and roll up Corbin for the win. Corbin was beyond angry, and the question now is whether he can maximize that anger and take it out on Cena.\n\nAs with WrestleMania, Cena will not be the star attraction at SummerSlam. Not even close. But his presence alone makes this match against Corbin that much more appealing. It's hard to imagine Cena, despite the fact that he has lost his past six SummerSlam matches, would let Corbin get over on him, especially considering that the 16-time champ just went down cleanly to Shinsuke Nakamura in a No. 1 contenders match. There's only so much beating a legend can take, right?\n\nFor Corbin, it's hard to imagine him being thrust into the championship spotlight anytime soon if he were to not only fall to Cena, but do so without a briefcase to fall back on.\n\nSmackDown tag team championship: The New Day vs. The Usos\n\nThese two teams have had tremendous chemistry lately, starting at Battleground, where The New Day won their first SmackDown tag-team titles. Even a seemingly filler match Tuesday on SmackDown was entertaining. But after their 124-day reign as champs, it seems doubtful The Usos would reclaim the titles. More bad news for Jey and Jimmy Uso: They have fallen in each of their previous three pay-per-view matches against The New Day. The only potential swerve here is if Kofi Kingston were to be a factor. On Tuesday, Daniel Bryan made it clear that Kingston would be the odd man out at SummerSlam. Hmmm.\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev\n\nThere's not a ton of history between Orton and Rusev, but the build between the two has been intriguing. Two weeks ago, Rusev attacked Orton as SmackDown came to a close, and just the other day, Orton landed a perfectly timed RKO on his Bulgarian opponent, and yes, it was out of nowhere.\n\nGiven an injury and long layoff after the brand shakeup, Rusev has not had a lot of TV exposure in recent months, and the one high-profile event he was in at Battleground was an underwhelming loss against John Cena.\n\nAs for Orton, he hopes he can make up for a confounding loss a year ago at SummerSlam, when Brock Lesnar busted The Viper's head open, a wound that caused the match to end prematurely. Orton hasn't won a SummerSlam match since 2013, when he cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase to take the title from Daniel Bryan.\n\nDespite Orton's dubious numbers and Rusev's lackluster existence lately, this match is as tough to call as any on the SummerSlam card.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T10:54:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "10:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "306428", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "House show"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_show", "score": 3}, {"id": "309765", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Narrative thread"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_thread", "score": 4}, {"id": "310725", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mick Foley"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Foley", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 5}, {"id": "328739", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "score": 2}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 4}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 3}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 5}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 2}, {"id": "339509", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pin (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 2}, {"id": "340562", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Stone Cold Steve Austin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin", "score": 3}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 2}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 4}, {"id": "349174", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "The Usos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Usos", "score": 3}, {"id": "351140", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "378642", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Randy Orton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton", "score": 2}, {"id": "383335", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Daniel Bryan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bryan", "score": 2}, {"id": "383643", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "RKO Pictures"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures", "score": 1}, {"id": "426498", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Alexander Rusev"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rusev", "score": 2}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 2}, {"id": "501661", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kofi Kingston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Kingston", "score": 2}, {"id": "520143", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shane McMahon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_McMahon", "score": 3}, {"id": "1273356", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The New Day (wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Day_(wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 2}], "image": "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0818%2Fr245786_1075x605_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:41:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "SummerSlam cheat sheet: SmackDown Live's matches", "originalArticle": null}

Can you talk us through the process of a WWE superstar getting new music and the part you play in that?\n\nYeah for sure. It's a cool process. I thought my music from NXT was really cool, but I really want to evolve. I not only want to evolve as a superstar and evolve my skills, I want to evolve every part of me. I thought new music was going to be a big part of that as I've changed a little bit since I was in NXT. I wanted something else that kind of fit me more and told a story and I think my new music really does. They put it together and came up with a few different versions and had to go back to the drawing board a couple of times, but I wanted something very special and very real to me and my new music is something that I think everybody is going to enjoy.\n\nIt's got a threatening vibe to it - something bad is going to happen when you hear this music. It's still not completely finished, I think we're going to add stuff to it, but when you hear it you will feel it and just understand 'I know what this guy is about to do, I know what he's going to do to that guy standing in the ring across from him'.\n\nDid you join CFO$ (John Paul Alicastro and Michael Conrad Lauri who create entrance music for WWE) in the studio? They created your last song, Superhuman.\n\nNo someone else did my new music, Jim Johnston [who composed entrance theme songs for WWE from 1985 to 2014, before leaving the company to work as a freelance composer] was really the biggest part of my new music. He did a lot of special things. I unfortunately didn't get to go in the studio with Jim and be a part of it, but he would send me constant updates, constant evolutions of the song and would ask me about it, I'd say 'hey it needs more rasp on the guitars' or something like that and he would do it. I had a distant involvement, but I think he made something special and iconic. It was really awesome to work with him on it.\n\nIt's such an exciting time for you, having won the Money In The Bank briefcase at the Money In The Bank pay-per-view in June, then feuded with Shinsuke Nakamura and faced him at Battleground in July. What was it like competing against him?\n\nIt was awesome, the guy has been around a long time and he has been an iconic star in Japan and now has come over to put his mark in WWE. Battleground I had to take it slow because I didn't know everything he was bringing to the table. It was a back and forth match where I had to try and stay out of distance of his striking range and he did the same with me. It was a pretty cool, interesting chess match to me and I had to do what I did at the end of it to get away from it with a disqualification! He has been an awesome guy to face because he's very strong and physical and that's what I like. He's a top tier guy so every time I can go into battle with a guy like that, it's a good time for me.\n\nTalking of top tier guys, there is nobody on a higher tier in WWE than John Cena. We saw him attack you on SmackDown to spark a new rivalry. How excited are you about the prospect of facing him, a 16-time world champion, at SummerSlam?\n\nThat would be awesome because he is the guy on the pedestal that people consider the mark - you have to go through John Cena if you want to be world champion, you have to go through John Cena if you want to be considered a top guy. He put me through a table and stuck his nose in my business when I was just going out to have a few words with Shinsuke and my words involved hitting him with the briefcase a few times, but that's not John Cena's business! I think I have a little bit of a score to settle with John. If he wants to face me at SummerSlam, I'm more than open to giving him a beating in front of that many people.\n\nI consider myself a world class athlete. Coming from the NFL, coming from grappling, boxing, all of those things tailored me to come here and become a WWE champion. Those things they coincide with it, the physicality, the footwork, the aggressive nature, the training, the diet. Coming from the NFL, I was 335lb in the NFL. You train yourself to be the best and coming to WWE I had to make some changes, I had to be a little bit quicker, a lit bit leaner, I lost 60lb, I changed my diet, I changed my workout and all those things tailored me to be WWE Champion.\n\nWhen I got in the ring with the indy darlings in NXT, the crowd hated it when I beat them up. All that does is add fuel to my fire. I enjoy and love to make people whine and cry about their favourite superstars. Nothing changed when I came to the main roster, I arrived on Smackdown and saw all the kids who love John Cena or Randy Orton, then you knock them down and see the look on their faces, that anger and disappointment, the anger on their faces, the frustration towards me, and that just makes me want to do it again and again and again, and have a blast doing it.\n\nWatch WWE SummerSlam 2017 live on the WWE Network or on Sky Sports Box Office at midnight on Sunday, August 20.\n\nYou can follow all the action as it happens in the Mirror Sport SummerSlam 2017 Live Blog.\n\nWWE Live returns to the UK this November, tickets available at www.bookingsdirect.com.\n\nRead More WWE Mirror Exclusive interviews", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T16:48:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 6300, "textStart": 6291, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "16:48:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "37", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "187023", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 3}, {"id": "306428", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "House show"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_show", "score": 3}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "328692", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of WWE personnel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_personnel", "score": 3}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 4}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 4}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 2}, {"id": "333979", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Music in professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_professional_wrestling", "score": 5}, {"id": "339509", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pin (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 2}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 4}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 4}, {"id": "351140", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 4}, {"id": "594244", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE Music Group"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Music_Group", "score": 3}, {"id": "684004", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Money in the Bank ladder match"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_ladder_match", "score": 4}, {"id": "823172", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jim Johnston (composer)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Johnston_(composer)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1273130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT (TV series)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT_(TV_series)", "score": 1}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 4}], "image": "http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article7942306.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Corbin-Ziggler.jpg", "timeCrawl": "16:48:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Baron Corbin - 'I'm tailored to be the WWE Champion'", "originalArticle": null}

Plus, who do we think will win? Check out all our predictions. By Matt Fowler\n\nOn Sunday, August 20th, WWE SummerSlam roars into the Barclays Center in Brooklyn for a stacked card of action featuring all major titles on the line, a handful of grudge matches (possibly featuring a demon or two), and -- assumedly -- a need to try and outshine NXT: TakeOver Brooklyn III from the night before.\n\nLet's dig into the card and shine a spotlight on the bouts that we're most excited for. From Sasha vs. Alexa to...a late entry in the field of \"Hey, this is actually interesting now,\" John Cena vs. Baron Corbin, here are the 5 matches we can't wait to see.\n\nRaw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss vs. Sasha Banks\n\nCan Sasha break her \"Brooklyn Curse?\" And can it really even be called a curse if Sasha's been in the women's title picture main event three years running (with her first Barclays match being a modern classic back at TakeOver Brooklyn I)? Either way, we're happy to watch both these women fight it out for the RAW Women's Championship (with rumors of their real-life heat fanning the flames of battle), and honestly we'll be happy with either gal winning. Though a Sasha victory will get the biggest pop for sure.\n\nUniversal Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman\n\nThe meatiest meatfest in the Meatpacking District, the giant Fatal Fourway for Brock's Universal Championship is going to be a showcase of hellacious slobberknockery. Any one of these guys can win. Brock, with all the misdirect going on about him leaving for UFC, could still just pick up the big win here. And yes, he can still be Universal Champ while doing the MMA thing. That's easy enough. Plus, they've taken the title from him in a multi-man match before so to do it again would be cliche at this point.\n\nStill, never count out Roman Reigns (ugh) and him being the default \"Guy/Dog.\" The biggest shocks (and biggest pops, most definitely) here would be Braun or Joe winning the title and becoming first time WWE world champs. Whatever the outcome, and whatever happens with the Shield reunion that we're all phantom booking in our brains, this is going to be a massively terrific contest.\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions Cesaro & Sheamus vs. Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins\n\nBoth tag team championship matches on the 'Slam card seem really strong (though we're sad Usos/New Day is on the pre-show), but it's the former-enemies-turned-frenemies whirlwind for the RAW tag titles that's keeping us glued. While it seems likely that Ambrose and Rollins will have too many issues to fully gel as a team, the same can almost be said of Shesaro too, given the way those two started out. This contest is anyone's call, but one thing we do know is that it'll be excellent. And if Seth and Dean win, we'll all be predicting a Shield swerve for the main event.\n\nUnited States Champion AJ Styles vs. Kevin Owens\n\nAdding Shane McMahon (Joe Pesci Lethal Weapon 3 poster style) to the Styles/Owens feud was the best thing to happen to the U.S. title picture right now. Not that these two superb stars couldn't deliver on their own, but after a few months you need to add a bit more spice to the stew (spice that isn't \"dangling Enzo in a shark cage\"). It's a great way to get Shane into some ring acton without giving him an actual match (that he'll probably lose). The build here has been a lot of fun too, with both AJ and Kevin having accidentally clocked Shane-O on the way to Sunday's card.\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nOriginally, in this fifth spot, was the Jinder Mahal/Shinsuke Nakamura match, but ever since Corbin's big flub on this past week's SmackDown Live, this match has become a \"make or break\" affair for him. Having that MITB contract almost guaranteed Baron a world championship and now he's been booked to seem like one of the biggest chowderheads in WWE history. A loss to Cena now, even though it's Cena, will be devastating. Is this where Corbin gets to shine? He'll either have to pull off a stunning win or get so close to winning that he gets some type of respectful m'lady fedora tip from Cena for him to be able to keep his head above water.\n\nSummerSlam Match Predictons\n\nIt's one thing to just predict and list which matches are likely to steal the show, but what about the outcomes?

His supporters steadfastly defend him; his detractors boo him mercilessly.\n\nAnd if his latest crowning moment happens inside the Barclays Center, WWE won't be happy with the reaction.\n\nFor one, Brooklyn, New York, is a fanbase heavy with \"smarks,\" the same diehard portion of the audience that has pushed back against Reigns' rise. Like Chicago, Philadelphia and Toronto, the Brooklyn crowd is often outspoken, favors internet darlings and has seemingly made a sport of booing Reigns.\n\nWhen Raw traveled to the Barclays Center last August, the fans treated The Big Dog like the heel despite him going up against the conniving, villainous Chris Jericho.\n\nReigns bowled over Jericho with a shoulder block and boos rained down. Jericho locked his foe in the Walls of Jericho and the crowd roared in approval.\n\nAgainst Brock Lesnar, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe at SummerSlam, Reigns can expect the same treatment.\n\nA good number of fans will be rooting for Joe and Strowman to emerge with the universal title in hand. Joe's lengthy journey to this point, through Ring of Honor, TNA and Japan, makes him easy to pull for. He has immense street cred, so to speak, with diehard fans.\n\nThe hosts of the Tights and Fights podcast are clearly behind Joe:\n\nAnd they aren't alone. Corey Jacobs of WrestlingNews.co wrote an article entitled \"It's Time for WWE to Put the Universal Championship on Samoa Joe.\" Daily DDT's Alexander Podgorski posted five reasons Joe should win on Sunday.\n\nThere's a similar push for Strowman to take the crown.\n\nHis destructive ways on Raw have endeared him to fans in a big way. He's become the red brand's monstrous anti-hero.\n\nThe Busted Open Twitter account noted back in July that Strowman had strong support in a fan poll about who they wanted to be champ:\n\nThere is not that same mindset for Reigns. The Big Dog has already been world champ three times while Joe and Strowman are fresher faces to the title scene.\n\nReigns outlasting Strowman, Joe and Lesnar at SummerSlam will result in audible disappointment from the Barclays Center crowd. His moment of glory will be overshadowed by the audience's vehement pushback, a jarring scene reminiscent of Reigns' wins at Royal Rumble 2015 and WrestleMania 32.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T14:29:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "14:29:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "113", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "196013", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "206540", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "241442", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2}, {"id": "302869", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "score": 3}, {"id": "303298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks", "score": 3}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "304692", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "score": 4}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 1}, {"id": "315014", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Total Nonstop Action Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 4}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 3}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 3}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 3}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 4}, {"id": "365538", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chris Jericho"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Jericho", "score": 3}, {"id": "378643", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam (2013)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam", "score": 4}, {"id": "434547", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "score": 2}, {"id": "434832", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Confetti"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confetti", "score": 4}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}], "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/689/771/f9ba68b69115876ad5234e0464f0d92a_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "timeCrawl": "01:44:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Gauging Fan Reaction to Potential Roman Reigns Title Win at WWE SummerSlam 2017", "originalArticle": null}

Still? But as millenials' biological need to be ensconced in nostalgia at every waking moment has intensified, so has the demand for the WWE. Revenue is up 10% year over year, WWE Network subscriptions have skyrocketed to well over 1.6 million, and total video across the brand's social media platforms recently eclipsed 4 billion (with a B). In other words, if you're NOT watching, you're the exception, not the rule.\n\nBut don't worry. The WWE's second biggest PPV event of the year may be mere days away, but we're here to help, getting you up to speed on everything you missed while you were busy being an adult for the past decade. So grab that fold-up chair and rub me down in baby oil, because it's time to send this one off the top rope.\n\nI think I remember SummerSlam as a trace element in the Mountain Dew/Halo/Cheeto dust swirl of my youth. Refresh my bong-fried memory again? SummerSlam is World Wrestling Entertainment's summer tentpole event which, if you can't guess by the name, features plenty of sweaty bedazzled man slamming in an arena full of other sweaty (significantly less bedazzled) men. To use a clunky every-sport analogy, if WrestleMania is WWE's Super Bowl -- and it is -- then SummerSlam is its Pro Bowl: Sunnier, funnier, and teeming with sentient muscle balls wearing Hawaiian shirts like they hoped they were going to be the only one to think of that.\n\nBoy, what a glowing endorsement. Maybe I'll just watch Thrones instead... Well, actually, if you like Game of Thrones, there's plenty of demo crossover here. 2016 SummerSlam breakthrough, Finn B\u00e1lor -- who's been out for almost a year following a shoulder injury sustained in last year's inaugural Universal Belt bout -- is set to revive his dormant \"Demon King\" shtick for a grudge match with Bray Wyatt. Meanwhile, Brock Lesnar is pretty much The Mountain. Sure, there are no dragons, but it can't be Christmas every day either.\n\nIf you watch 60 Minutes on Sunday nights and fancy yourself a Serious Person\u2122, however, I strongly suggest you have a few beers before attempting to turn into the spin. I'm a miserable, dignified f -- k too, but if you give it a chance, you'll be amazed what watching a bunch of pleather panty-clad women (or men, whatever works for you) beat the shit out of each other on live TV can do for your mental health.\n\nDid someone say pleather panties? OK, I'm in. So what are the major storylines I should, uhh, buff up on? As always, it's all about Brock Lesnar. The only dude to ever successfully crossover from sports entertainment to actual sports (and back again) has been setting up a return to UFC for several months, and SummerSlam looks like it could finally be the catalyst. Lesnar will be competing in a Fatal 4-Way --\n\nWait, wait, wait: Fatal 4-Way? A four-hulk free-for-all. No teams, no rules, just right.\n\nOK, go on... against fellow prehistoric rock monsters Roman Reigns, Samoa Joe, and Braun Strowman in a battle to retain the Universal Championship (don't ask, we doubt even Vince McMahon could explain it). Due to the \"random\" (and by random we mean obsessively scripted) nature of the Fatal 4-Way, however, Lesnar's sideshow manager, Paul Heyman, has already gone on record saying that if Lesnar loses the belt, he will walk away from the WWE.\n\nExpect Lesnar to lose the belt.\n\nThat's not the only match though right? Not. Even. Close. In addition to a full slate of Saturday action from the WWE's increasingly popular feeder league, NXT, the main SummerSlam fight card also includes New Japan Wrestling sensation Shinsuke Nakamura -- think Thriller-era Michael Jackson crossed with the Drunken Master -- battling Jinder Mahal for the WWE Championship, Alexa Bliss and Sasha Banks facing off for the incrementally de-sexualized Raw Women's Championship, and midtown-Irish-pub-level parody Sheamus teaming up with Cesaro to fend off white trash heartthrob, Dean Ambrose, and reformed dick-pic-er, Seth Rollins, for the Raw Tag Team Championship.\n\nSounds like my family reunion... ZING! And as if that wasn't enough speedo-and-bondage-boot action for you and your suddenly interested girlfriend, John Cena -- who you've probably actually heard of -- is set to wrestle Baron Corbin, while fan favorites AJ Styles and Kevin Owens will fake-punch it out for the United States Championship, with the comish's son, Shane McMahon, serving as the guest referee. Shane is best known for his death-defying leaps in and around the ring (and for surviving a recent helicopter crash), though, so expect him to male-stripper tear his too-small zebra stripes off and flatten someone like an asphalt roller at some point. Hell, maybe he'll even win the belt. Who knows, sometimes I swear they make this shit up as they go.\n\nThat's a lot to process, even if you are one of the 12 college-educated viewers. Any tips on who to root for? Sure. Maybe these pocket bios will help.\n\nAny other insider advice? Yeah, make sure to load up on snacks -- anything with \"nacho\" flavoring will do -- and cardboard vats of fried chicken, if readily available in your area of West Virginia. SummerSlam is like seven grueling hours of all America, all the time, and you'll need to periodically refuel if you want to have anything left for that Monster Truck rally tomorrow.\n\nAlso, try not to mention it in front of your office IT guy, unless you want to spend half the morning searching your desk for something stab into your earholes while he grandstands about The Miz's inauthentic ego-worship, only to realize you loaned your scissors to Steve last week and this is your fate now, you stupid, stupid idiot.\n\nSo say I hypothetically wanted to watch this thing, you know, as a sociological experiment or whatever, how would I do it? Well, if it's an immersive societal examination you're after, head on down to Barclays Center on Sunday night, where half of Pennsylvania, some of New Jersey, and most of Long Island will be found in a state of mutually suspended reality.\n\nIf you'd prefer a nostalgia experience far from the prying eyes of anyone you'll ever have to see again in your entire life, however, then pay-per-view or a WWE Network subscription (boy, you really got into this, huh?) should do the trick. Either way, go in with an open mind and -- if you're watching with friends who are fans -- zipped lips. Everybody knows it's fake and saying so doesn't make you a beacon of truth in the eye of the world's spiraling factacolypse.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T20:38:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "20:38:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302530", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chemical element"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element", "score": 3}, {"id": "302762", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "score": 2}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "307188", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "score": 2}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 3}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

At one point in the match, Seth performed a running powerbomb and slammed Finn into the safety barrier outside the ring, and disaster struck.\n\nFinn suffered a 180 degree labrum tear, a torn bicep and pectoral tendon, cartilage damage and a fracture to the glenoid neck socket.\n\nThis wasn't enough to thwart The Demon King, however, as he went to defeat Seth Rollins with his patented Coup De Grace and became the first ever WWE Universal Champion.\n\nHe also became the first ever Superstar to relinquish the Title, as his injuries were too severe to continue in the ring for several months.\n\nBalor is currently on the road back to the top, most recently ending his rivalry with Elias and is now in the midst of mind games with The Eater of Worlds, Bray Wyatt, who he faces this Sunday at SummerSlam.\n\nBrock Lesnar was the specimen that blasted on the scene in 2002, attacking Al Snow, Maven and Spike Dudley, with the latter being on the receiving end of a devastating triple powerbomb. And who was by his side? None other than The Advocate, Paul Heyman, who was seen barking orders.\n\nAt the time, Brock was nicknamed \"The Next Big Thing\", and boy were they right. His first feud was with The Hardy Boyz, defeating them at multiple PPVs including Backlash and Judgement Day.\n\nAfter winning the King of the Ring final against RVD, Brock earned his WWE Undisputed Championship shot against The Rock at SummerSlam 2002. Brock executed his own Rock Bottom and F5, and with the help of an interference from Paul Heyman, he landed the big time and won his first championship.\n\nBrock began to make an even bigger name for himself as he went to war with The Undertaker at No Mercy, defeating him in a Hell in a Cell match.\n\nWe all know how The Deadman and The Beast's rivalry progressed in the future.\n\nLesnar went on to feud with Big Show, the feud that led Paul Heyman to betray him. Lesnar would suffer his first pin fall loss to Show at Survivor Series, which catapulted his reputation with the fans, and went on to do great things with the company.\n\nKurt Angle's first appearance at WWE came in 1999, quickly establishing his American Hero character based on his gold medal win at the 1998 Summer Olympics.\n\nAfter his initial stint as a \"good guy\", fans quickly began to boo his entrances, which Kurt quickly capitalised on and turned into a villain, patronising his fellow Superstars and the audience themselves.\n\nJust a year later, Angle won the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, and then losing both titles without ever conceding a fall in a two-pin Triple Threat match at WrestleMania 2000.\n\nWith these two Titles a distant memory, he then became a top-tier Superstar, feuding with The Rock and Triple H which led to a Triple Threat Match at SummerSlam. Angle was stretchered out during the match after a Pedigree through the announcement table.\n\nAs The People's Champion and The King of Kings battled on, Kurt would be brought back in alongside Vince McMahon to take on Triple H, but after a tussle between The Game and Kurt over a sledgehammer, Vince was on the receiving end of a bash.\n\nWith Kurt and Triple H distracted, the Rock threw the American Hero over the ropes, and then pinned The Game after dishing out The People's Elbow.\n\nSummerSlam would be the catalyst to spark his career. He would go on to have a heated rivalry with Triple H, with Kurt frequently interfering in The Game's matches and ruining his title opportunities.\n\nThey'd go on to do battle a week before Unforgiven, as Angle attacked Triple H with a sledgehammer, leading to the American Hero kissing Stephanie McMahon as her husband lay unconscious in the ring.\n\nTriple H earned vengeance at Unforgiven, but Kurt would go on to have one of the greatest rivalries in recent memories against Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n\nSummerSlam 1998 was nicknamed \"Highway to Hell\", with a fierce main card on the table. Stone Cold was due to defend his title against The Undertaker, Ken Shamrock had a huge bout with Owen Hart, and X-Pac battled Jeff Jarret, but it was the two young guns that stole the show - The Rock and Triple H.\n\nThe two up and coming Superstars faced off in a Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title, with carnage ensuing. After weaponising the ladder to both their advantages, Chyna delivered a low blow to The Rock which allowed HHH to win the Intercontinental Title.\n\nUnfortunately, Triple H would be sidelined with a knee injury and gave up the title, but while he was away The Rock went on to win the WWF Championship at Survivor Series.\n\nThe two would reignite their rivalry in an I Quit match, The Rock accompanied by Kane and The Game by Chyna. Much to Triple H's dismay, he was forced to say I Quit to stop Kane chokeslamming Chyna.\n\nHowever, Chyna later attacked Triple H, showing that she planned to betray him all along.\n\nThe Game would then go on to have one of his most memorable heel turns, and become a part of The Corporation.\n\nDaniel Bryan is the Rocky of the WWE Universe - the true underdog story that everyone wanted to succeed. His unconventional looks, his smaller frame, his wild facial hair, it was everything that the WWE hadn't seen in a Title contender before. But nobody resonated with the fans better than the do-or-die Daniel Bryan.\n\nBefore SummerSlam 2013, the Team Hell No tag-team was formed of Bryan and Kane, where they would often bicker between themselves during matches. They would go on to have a successful run as WWE Tag Team Champions, feuding with the likes of Team Rhodes Scholars, 3MB and, later down the line, The Shield, who they lost the titles to.\n\nBryan became obsessed to prove he wasn't the weak link of Team Hell No and launched the \"Yes!' movement, becoming more aggressive in the process.\n\nThis was the year he began to become the Superstar that put his name in lights. After Team Hell No separated, Bryan went on to better Randy Orton in a rivalry, and continued his hot streak by picking up wins over Sheamus and Christian.\n\nThe crowd was pining for Bryan to win the Money in the Bank that year, but was foiled by Curtis Axel, a non-participant, with Randy Orton picking up the win.\n\nHowever, the crowd would have their dreams come true as John Cena picked Bryan to be his opponent at SummerSlam 2013. This is where The Corporation began to dampen any hopes Bryan would have at victory by psychologically and physically damaging him. Bryan was labelled the 'B+ Player', he was put through gauntlet matches, and was made to face his old tag-team partner Kane.\n\nNone of that mattered, as Cena and Bryan went hammer and tong, as the Yes Man beat the odds to become the WWE Champion. Special referee Triple H, however, had other plans, and planted a Pedigree to Bryan. Orton would cash in his Money in the Bank and cut the title reign short.\n\nSummerSlam would further propel his connection with the crowd, and went on to create the biggest atmospheres in stadiums across the world from his matches - he'd feud with The Corporation, Randy Orton, and the up and coming Bray Wyatt.\n\nBryan would go on to main event WrestleMania XXX, defeating Batista and Randy Orton in a Triple Threat Match to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T23:36:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 792, "textStart": 785, "imp": true, "date":

It just might happen based on recent comments from \"The Big Dog\" when asked about battling the 16-time WWE champion. Current WWE free agent John Cena has been a member of the professional wrestling organization for quite some time now but has yet to engage in a one-on-one match with the former member of The Shield. Both starts are on different brands within WWE currently, although these two stars seem destined to collide. Does Roman Reigns want it to happen, though?\n\nThe current WWE Raw roster member is battling in a Fatal 4-Way this coming Sunday at WWE's SummerSlam 2017 PPV. He'll take on Samoa Joe, Braun Strowman, and Brock Lesnar for the WWE Universal Championship. Cena will be involved in a match booked on SmackDown Live as he takes on former \"Mr. Money in the Bank\" Baron Corbin. Still, Reigns was recently interviewed by Sports Illustrated and spoke on several topics including his promo in the ring on Raw one night after defeating The Undertaker at WrestleMania 33. Reigns said he felt he \"had everyone on a string\" in that moment and that he even realized he was eating into time for another match on the Raw card.\n\nSo now that he's cleared one of WWE's top superstars of all-time, what about John Cena? Reigns commented on whether or not he wants to have a match with him in the future.\n\n\"I think so. If you're here for the right reasons -- and this doesn't just go for wrestling, this is anything, this is what drives our world -- you wanna be in there with the best. To say John Cena is not one of the best of all time is asinine. He is. He's a 16-time heavyweight champion. There's only two men in the whole world that can say that. So to be able to share the ring with him, to do a big fight with John Cena, I'm all for that.\"\n\nReigns goes on to mention that he didn't come to WWE just to \"blend in\" but to \"stick out.\"\n\n\"I'm stepping up. I think I've proved that over the years. I think, what a great way to honor both of our careers and what we're trying to do and the way we try to drive this train. What better way to do it than in the ring, one on one.\"\n\nWhile there's no rumored match planned between Roman Reigns and John Cena, it's been talked about for quite a while now. WWE has teased it. Fans have discussed it. The two competitors even traded tweet jabs at one another last month. Now they'll be part of the same WWE pay-per-view this weekend, and free agent John Cena is reportedly heading to the WWE Raw program to compete in the weeks after the PPV event. That could set up a Reigns vs. Cena WWE match at some point very soon.\n\nBoth superstars could very well stake a claim towards the WWE Universal Championship unless Reigns has won it this Sunday. It's a prize that John Cena has yet to win and it could be the one he wins to break Ric Flair's record of major championship reigns. As to when this match might happen involving Cena vs. Reigns, that's anyone's guess. WWE loves to tease and build up to epic matches for major PPV events. The biggest is next year's WrestleMania 34 in New Orleans. There's also the Royal Rumble 2018 in January. Ironically, both Reigns and Cena are currently tied as favorites for the Paddy Power betting odds to win that Rumble match. If one wins, could the other be the champion they face at Mania?\n\nThe two will probably be face-to-face soon. It would not be all that surprising to have John Cena and Roman Reigns cross paths in some capacity once Cena starts working on WWE's Raw show more. Whether that is during a Cena or Reigns' promo in the ring, or an actual booked match of some sort, it should be interesting to see what transpires. Most likely, WWE teases a match but it doesn't happen until a bigger event than Raw. However, in the mind of Roman Reigns and many fans, this match with John Cena will happen one day in the future. As Reigns would say, \"Believe that.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T21:10:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "21:10:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 4}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 5}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 3}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 3}, {"id": "340548", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ric Flair"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Flair", "score": 2}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 4}, {"id": "340554", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of WWE pay-per-view events"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_pay-per-view_events", "score": 2}, {"id": "340565", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "The Undertaker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undertaker", "score": 3}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 4}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 5}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 3}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 3}, {"id": "349082", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "score": 5}, {"id": "537112", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Royal Rumble (2014)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble", "score": 1}, {"id": "556815", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Fatal 4-Way"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Fatal_4-Way", "score": 3}, {"id": "684004", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Money in the Bank ladder match"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_ladder_match", "score": 3}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 3}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 3}], "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wwe-star-roman-reigns-wants-john-cena-match-but-when.jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:10:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "WWE Star Roman Reigns Talks About John Cena Match, But When Will It Happen?", "originalArticle": null}

SummerSlam may not have the bounty of \"must-see\" matchups, and outside of Brock Lesnar there are no part-time stars, which may make the event seem more like a regular PPV and not one of the biggest wrestling events of the year, but I think ultimately WWE would benefit from having guys that are not as established on the card. If you compare it to the WrestleMania card, you have Braun Strowman, Jinder Mahal, Shinsuke Nakamura, Baron Corbin and Samoa Joe all in big matches at SummerSlam, yet they were not even on the main WrestleMania card. If they are the future of the company, it is great for them to get a chance to actually wrestle on the biggest stages.\n\nThe main event will be Roman Reigns vs Strowman vs Samoa Joe vs Lesnar for the Universal Championship. I like this match-up because you can make a case for all four guys winning the match and it would make sense. The frenetic style of a Fatal-4-Way and the inclusion of weapons and tables spots should make up for any inadequacies some of the performers might have in the ring and the finish isn't predictable from the outset, which should make it a pretty good match.\n\nWWE loves their multi-man title programs though. It does offer them a ton of creative flexibility and the program is simple to write; have the guys wrestle each other in singles matches, have them team up against each other, do some brawls where everyone gets involved and at the end you can have a finish where nobody really loses clean and you can continue the feud that way. However, I think it depletes their ability to foster really good singles feuds. Unless you are in a faction, it is hard to really become a big star through multi-man matches. I also get tired of the same-old tropes WWE trots out; such as when the announcers say \"Mathematically, Brock Lesnar will likely NOT be the champion after Sunday!\" or \"Remember, Brock Lesnar does not have to be pinned or submitted to lose the title!\". We get it guys; there is a multi-man match with the same rules on almost every show. I would bet on Lesnar winning the match, then Reigns, Joe and Strowman, but the best thing about the match is that it isn't unrealistic to see Strowman win it. It is unusual to have a four-way match where all four competitors are legit contenders.\n\nThe other world title match is the WWE Championship match between Mahal and Nakamura. The possibilities for this match became fewer when Corbin failed in his Money in the Bank contract cash-in, which I'll get too later. The Mahal title reign is going about as expected; they have put in a lot of effort, giving him a big entrance, an entourage, some great entrance music, and he scowls a lot and looks the part. However, the matches are always going to be limited and every single important one has been marred by interference. However, WWE is committed to making an Indian star and he is the one they chose, although he isn't really connecting and business in India isn't up at all, it doesn't make sense to stop after a few months. I would suspect this match ends with some interference by the Singh Brothers and Mahal retains, but sets up a rematch for the next PPV.\n\nOne of the highlights of RAW the past few weeks has been the slow formation of Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose as a team once again. I like that WWE has teased them teaming up, but only to have either Ambrose or Rollins back away at the last moment, before putting them together again. The logic behind the booking is simple but effective; set up a moment that the fans want to see, tease that they are going to do it, end up not doing it so the fans are disappointed, but then turn it around and do the moment, which in this case was Ambrose and Rollins bumping fists. Additionally, with Sheamus and Cesaro they could have a really good match and the finish is kind of unknown; I wouldn't rule out Rollins making a heel turn and stabbing Ambrose in the back again, or better yet, Ambrose turns on Rollins.\n\nThe United States Championship is on the line, with AJ Styles defending against Kevin Owens. I would say that this match is going to be really good, but after the quagmire that was their match at Battleground, I can't guarantee that. The inclusion of Shane McMahon as the guest referee screams that there will be another controversial finish, with the logical outcome being an eventual match between Shane and Owens. WWE is always looking for ways to thread stories together, so during PPVs we always get a lot of screwy finishes because that is the best way to get from feud to feud. The result is you have easy ways to set up future matches, but the side effect is that you often have disheartening finishes. It depends really on why you watch WWE; either for the storyline development or for the quality of the matches and the wrestlers themselves. Neither side is right or wrong, but it is a matter of taste and there are some fans such as myself that would like to see more clean finishes.\n\nThe biggest development over the last week was Corbin losing in his bid to cash-in the Money in the Bank contract. While the moment made Corbin look like a total geek, I think in the long run it will be beneficial for his career. The Money in the Bank briefcase is a symbol, more or less, that a wrestler is going to be champion one day. Corbin was not ready to be champion (although in the Jinder Mahal era I'm not sure that really matters) and the briefcase was a lot of pressure on him to get over as a real superstar. I don't think skill wise he is there yet, so this is a burden off of his shoulders. On top of that, I think being the guy that blew his Money in the Bank contract will give him additional purpose, and put him on a path to avenge his embarrassment. As a fan, I have never been more interested in Corbin than after he had lost the match to Mahal, and he did a great job acting like losing the match was truly a crisis for his career.\n\nWith that being said, I think the first step in putting Corbin on that path of vengeance would be to have him beat John Cena at SummerSlam. Cena is on his way over to RAW which has led WWE to hastily put him in matches with the key SmackDown guys they are trying to get over (Mahal, Nakamura and Corbin). Whatever he ends up doing on RAW, he can sustain a loss to Corbin and still appear like a huge star because of how much capital he has built up over the years as a credible contender. It would be the right kind of rub for Corbin and put him in a much better position than he was while holding the Money in the Bank contract.\n\nThere are a slew of other matches on this card, judging by the number of matches on the show SummerSlam 2017 might be one of the biggest shows in WWE history. The Smackdown Women's Championship will be Naomi defending against Natalya. Lurking in the wings is Carmella, who can cash in HER Money in the Bank contract, and SummerSlam seems like as good of a time as any other to do the cash-in. The SmackDown Women's division has been different than I expected, as I figured Charlotte and Becky Lynch would be kind of the staples of the division but have been kind of irrelevant in recent months. Naomi and Natalya could have a decent match, although we will see what they get for time.\n\nThe RAW's Women's Championship is also in an odd situation. Bayley had been completely destroyed by terrible booking during her feud with Alexa Bliss, and just when it looked like she earned another crack at the title, Nia Jax injured her, which hastily switched the match from being Bliss vs Bayley to being Bliss vs Sasha Banks. The key here is that WWE has been teasing Jax vs Bliss for months, so it would look like the next title program would be Bliss as champion defending against Jax. With WWE booking though, they could always have Banks win at SummerSlam, lose the title back to Bliss soon after, and then do the program with Jax.\n\nThe program between Enzo Amore, Big Cass and The Big Show has gotten a ton of time on RAW lately. Cass has been pretty impressive; his turn on Enzo has gotten real, old-school kind of heat that is rare today and the segments between him, Enzo and Show have been pretty good. I think it is safe to say Cass is winning this match, but how? Will he just beat Show clean, or will Enzo turn on Show and become Cass's manager? I would prefer the latter, if only to get Enzo in his natural role as a heel manager.\n\nFinn Balor makes his appreciated return to PPV by facing Bray Wyatt. Wyatt is in a tricky position right now in WWE and I think his character needs to be re-booted somewhat. The original idea was that he was a cult leader, but he doesn't have any followers anymore. His promos are redundant and nobody ever understands them. His biggest issue right now is that because he is the abstract character, WWE is tempted to abstract stuff with him that are not resonating with the audience. Whether that is the insect projections at WrestleMania (did I seriously just write that?), the House of Horrors, or pouring \"blood\" on Balor, it comes across as hokey and awkward. He has been involved in some terrible matches this year and when that happens with a variety of different opponents it starts to look like Wyatt is the common factor. Balor should win but they are probably going to do some crazy finish that sets up another match and leaves the fans confused.\n\nThe last match confirmed for the main card is Rusev vs Randy Orton, which does not feel like a very important match-up. Rusev remains a one-note character, like a Jinder Mahal LITE, basically being a patriot and running afoul of Americans who have their own brand of patriotism. That is a disappointment because I think he is capable of a lot more; he has a unique look, great athlete, consistent worker, good talker and has great comedic timing. With different booking he could be a strong babyface, but that doesn't appear to be in the cards right now. Orton has been in a prominent position all year but is probably having the worst year of his career from a match-quality standpoint.\n\nThere are additional matches on the preshow, including the Akira Tozawa vs Neville rematch and the SmackDown Tag Team Championships match between The New Day and The Usos. Those are actually two matches that are going to be pretty good, but it is tough to sit through the pre-show matches when the main show is going to be over four hours long.\n\nSummerSlam is going to be a very interesting show; overall I think the build has been pretty good and there are some intriguing match-ups on the card from a storyline standpoint. I think what is going to make or break the show is how long it runs and how satisfying the matches are. Last year's show I thought was terrible because it lasted forever and a lot of the matches were disappointing and the main event was rushed. I think this year they have put too many matches on the card, instead of feeling like a special showcase for the elite, it feels like a cache of quick matches highlighting as many people on the roster as possible. With the exception of the Universal Championship match, really you are going to see better versions of all these matches on the separate brand PPVs.\n\nG1 Finals\n\nThe annual round-robin tournament in New Japan Pro Wrestling came to a conclusion Sunday night with Tetsuya Naito defeating Kenny Omega in the finals. Fans online have been saying that this was the best tournament in the history of the industry when it came to match quality; and while I haven't seen every tournament in history, I can't think of a tournament that was better. The key matches were outstanding on the final three nights, and compared to many other reviewers who watched the tournament, I gave the matches lower ratings than most.\n\nHiroshi Tanahashi vs Tetsuya Naito: ****\u00bd NJPW G1 Climax A Block Final 8/11\n\nTanahashi turned in a wonderful tournament considering he wrestled the entire tournament with a torn biceps. At 40, Tanahashi is not going to be able to match the athleticism of Kazuchika Okada and Omega, but he makes up for it using his charisma and intellect. The story of the match was Naito working over the injured bicep, but Tanahashi countering by attacking the shoulder/neck area of Naito. Tanahashi actually controlled most of the match and had Naito locked in the clover leaf for what felt like forever before Naito made the ropes. Although Okada and Omega are more well-known to a global audience, you could make the argument that Naito and Tanahashi is a bigger feud in Japan. Naito and his stable, Los Ingobernables de Japon, are the most over acts in Japan and sell a ton of merchandise. Even as Tanahashi moves into the twilight of his career, he can still go in the ring and has that charisma and reputation of being the guy that saved NJPW in the late 2000s when they were only drawing 18,000 fans to the Tokyo Dome, to carrying the company to the lucrative heights it is currently enjoying.\n\nKazuchika Okada vs Kenny Omega: ***** - NJPW G1 Climax B Block Final 8/12\n\nAnother instant classic; it is always going to be compared to the other two matches and you could really pick any of them as the best bout. The first match went 47 minutes and the second match was the 60-minute draw, so this match was different in that it had a 30-minute time limit, which meant that they had to work faster to get the same emotion as their previous matches. There was a bunch of crazy spots, including Okada taking a reverse hurricanrana on the floor, which was disgusting. Not all fans have the patience to sit through a 45+ minute match, so if you are looking for an introduction into these two this would be the match I'd recommend. Omega getting the victory for the first time and pinning him after a solitary One Winged Angel continues the story and they will definitely meet again, probably some time early next year. I still think their first match was the best one because it was such a watershed moment with everything they did, but the following two matches are on the same level.\n\nTetsuya Naito vs Kenny Omega: ****\u00be - NJPW G1 Climax Final 8/13\n\nA really fun final match that was just as dangerous as the match previously. Really, Omega's greatest achievement is wrestling these two final matches on back-to-back nights. Not only were both matches physically exhausting, but he did it at the end of a gruelling tournament that leaves everyone involved banged up with nagging injuries. The table spot that had Naito somehow miss the table when he leaped up to give Omega a jumping piledriver, was pretty grisly although Naito was able to keep Omega safe as they crashed onto the floor. There were some killer spots where Omega gave Nato a DDT right on top of the steel post and then had Naito basically jump straight up in the air and land face first on the turnbuckle and then flip inside-out to the mat. The beauty of NJPW is that Omega had this amazing performance and yet, you can't argue that Naito is just as valid of a winner of the G1 as Omega would have been. I would give this match the full five stars, but I thought the finish wasn't as good as it could have been and that might be nit-picking that is the kind of level of perfection you need to have for a match to get a perfect score.\n\nI'd also like to highlight the dramatic return of Katsuyori Shibata, who walked to the ring as a complete surprise right before intermission on the last day. To the best of my knowledge, I thought Shibata was still in the hospital and re-learning how to walk after he had suffered traumatic brain damage during a match with Okada earlier in the year. His music playing and then walking to the ring was a complete shock, and it was incredible to see how many people in the audience were in tears. Truly a special moment that even non-fans of wrestling can appreciate.\n\nYAMATO vs T-Hawk: ****1/4 - Dragon Gate Kobe Pro Wrestling Festival\n\nShingo Takagi, El Lindaman and Takashi Yoshida vs Genki Horiguchi, Jimmy Susumu and Ryo Jimmy Saito: **** - Dragon Gate Kobe Pro Wrestling Festival\n\nJimmy Kagetora vs Flamita: **** - Dragon Gate Kobe Pro Wrestling Festival\n\nBrian Cage vs Katushiko Nakajima: ****1/2 - NOAH Summer Navigation 7/27", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T12:49:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.545098066329956, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "12:49:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "113", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "66027", "label": {"eng": "T\u014dky\u014d-to"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "T\u014dky\u014d-to"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "304496", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Insect"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect", "score": 2}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

But to be here and have it come full circle in the main event at 'SummerSlam,' it's been a whirlwind of a year.\"\n\nA year ago, Joe captured the NXT Championship from Nakamura, but they were hardly strangers. The wrestlers first met nearly a decade ago when Joe was running a WWE affiliate program in southern California, helping to groom new talent for the company.\n\nNakamura, then signed by New Japan Pro-Wrestling, was sent over to what Joe called \"his dojo\" to be trained up.\n\n\"It's funny being here now because it's all these people throughout my career who I've met at varying times in my career and many early on where it's kind of full circle, and we're all meeting and converging on WWE at the same time,\" Joe said. \"My relationship with Shinsuke, I mean, he's a tremendous guy, we've maintained our friendship for well over a decade, and he's one of those incredible, rare, once-in-a-lifetime athletes whose ability transcends international border, which is something that's not often able to be done.\"\n\nTheir paths also weren't straight lines to the WWE. Joe made stops at other promotions: Ring of Honor, TNA and throughout the indie scene before signing with NXT, WWE's developmental brand, in 2015. Nakamura made his pro-wrestling debut in Japan in 2002, and established himself as one of the most entertaining and sought-after wrestlers through his work there, before WWE offered him a contract early in 2016.\n\nSPORER: Jinder Mahal's unique, quick rise to WWE stardom\n\n\"Joe is an old friend. When we were young we knew each other,\" Nakamura said. \"I can relate a lot to him.\"\n\nNow, both are fixtures in WWE's plans entering \"SummerSlam 2017,\" one of the biggest wrestling events on the calendar. Joe will wrestle in his second title match, after having lost to Brock Lesnar at \"Great Balls of Fire\" in July. Nakamura will compete for a belt on the main roster for his first time when he takes on Jinder Mahal.\n\n\"The biggest thing here in WWE is that if they see some really valuable qualities in you, they're really going to do their best to maximize them and put you into the scenarios and into the situations where that's going to make the most impact,\" Joe said. \"For me they've definitely done that.\"\n\nThe roads they traveled, circuitous in some regards, have taken somewhat similar steps, leading them each back to Brooklyn a year after they headlined for NXT.\n\n\"I hoped I would be here,\" Nakamura said. \"Last year in Brooklyn that moment was phenomenal. After the match, everyone was singing. Getting home, on the street, on the subway, everybody was singing. I wanted to make it happen again.\"\n\nEach also has been able to get a major pop from crowds who were both itching for them to make it to WWE and to rise through the NXT ranks.\n\nThere was perhaps no louder crowd reaction to Nakamura's debut on \"SmackDown\" two nights after \"WrestleMania 33\" in April, when an incredibly hot crowd needed to only see Nakamura walk down the ramp to explode.\n\n\"I didn't imagine it like this,\" Nakamura said. \"I just wanted to enjoy every moment, what's next.\"\n\nMORE: Three times wrestling fans didn't get who they wanted\n\nNakamura and Joe find themselves in upper-card programs, but each said he has bigger plans for what their respective WWE futures hold.\n\n\"For me, I've always been confident in my ability and what I've been able to bring to the table -- what I can bring to a Brock Lesnar matchup,\" Joe said. \"Paul (Heyman) obviously has always had a great eye for talent his entire career. He knew what would happen between myself and Brock Lesnar, and I've only kind of scratched the surface of it. I'm not done with Brock by any stretch of the imagination.\"\n\nNakamura, who recently defeated Cena to become the No. 1 contender for \"SmackDown's\" top belt, said he would like to work with the veteran superstar again, among other goals.\n\n\"One of my first goals was a 'WrestleMania,' a world title, wrestle all of the superstars,\" Nakamura said, who named Randy Orton as someone he'd like to work with.\n\n\"I want to make a great match against everybody. I want to prove myself. I want to show I can wrestle to the WWE Universe.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T21:33:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.545098066329956, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "21:33:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "113", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 2}, {"id": "315014", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Total Nonstop Action Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 4}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 4}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332486", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling promotion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_promotion", "score": 3}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 2}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340548", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ric Flair"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Flair", "score": 3}, {"id": "340554", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of WWE pay-per-view events"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_pay-per-view_events", "score": 4}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 3}, {"id": "340572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar", "score": 4}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 2}, {"id": "358612", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New Japan Pro Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Japan_Pro_Wrestling", "score": 3}, {"id": "383378", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Championship", "score": 4}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 3}, {"id": "434547", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "score": 3}, {"id": "556815", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Fatal 4-Way"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Fatal_4-Way", "score": 3}, {"id": "1273130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT (TV series)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT_(TV_series)", "score": 2}], "image": "http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/a/95/shinsuke-nakamura-wwe-022216-wwe-ftr_56gzbq0vwvxdzfj7up5zgwxf.jpg?t=161807483", "timeCrawl": "11:03:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "WWE 'Summerslam' 2017: Shinsuke Nakamura, Samoa Joe careers cross again in Brooklyn", "originalArticle": null}

Either way, this story needs some interesting stuff to happen and fast.\n\nNakamura winning or losing can both be good business, but can't see WWE bringing him this far without him getting the belt. The greenest worker in the match, Strowman has exceeded the fans and critics wildest expectations in the ring, and can only get better with time. They have seen other hyped tag teams either return to action or arrive in the WWE around them and receive a healthy diet of opportunities, i.e.\n\nSo, Shane, are you going to call this one down the middle?

Styles in the short-lived WWE Club reunion in early 2016.\n\nMost recently, Samoa Joe got his chance at the Universal strap. Even if both duos restrain themselves for bouts down the line, they should still have one of the most memorable matches of the night.\n\nBrock Lesnar faces a tall task in Brooklyn on Sunday. Their singular confrontation was teased, however, during last Monday's edition of RAW. During the interview, Strowman talked about Chipotle and how much he spends there a week. Could Summerslam 2017 be the event where her winning streak will break? Cena's last SummerSlam victory came in 2010 when Cena and \"Team WWE\" defeated \"Team Nexus\" in a 7-on-7 elimination tag team match. Brock Lesnar's beast incarnate persona would not suffer as a result, which would come in handy upon Lesnar's next quarterly set of appearances.\n\nThis isn't the first time there's been a movement urging WWE to dump Trump.

The WWE champ will once again have The Singh Brothers alongside him, but he hasn't ruled out a future return for The Great Khali if and when he needs him.\n\nWe saw former World Champion Khali come to the aid of Mahal at last month's Battleground, taking out Randy Orton to allow the current WWE Champ to retain his crown by escaping the Punjabi Prison. And although we don't expect to see Khali in Brooklyn his weekend, Mahal hasn't ruled out leaning on his friend again if and when he needs him.\n\n\"You haven't seen the last of the Great Khali in WWE.\" The Modern Day Majahara told Gorilla Position during a media morning to preview his big title defence at SummerSlam.\n\n\"I brought Khali in for one match. There was a reason I picked the Punjabi Prison match, because there was no disqualification, no count-outs and really did everything legally to win that match. As for now he's back in India, but I can say for certain that it's not the last we've seen of him.\"\n\nWith or without Khali's help Mahal is certainly looking past his match with Nakamura on Sunday and to a list of possible opponents who could be next for the fiftieth WWE Champion. He's even laid down the gauntlet for a possible champion versus champion match with Universal Title holder Brock Lesnar.\n\n\"I'll take on anybody, whoever is next. Maybe AJ Styles, I think our styles would mix very well. Kevin Owens maybe, Baron Corbin, who may have lost the Money In The Bank contract but he's coming for a title shot too. Why not aim higher? Brock Lesnar.

It was a move that caught us all by surprise. The main event of SmackDown was something no one should have missed, as it has altered the SummerSlam card irreparably, and left millions of fans with a \"huh\" or \"OMG\" look on their face.\n\nIt was absolutely the right time for this to happen. Remember, we are just one week removed when the entire wrestling community was asking \"Why didn't Carmella cash in when she had the chance?\". It is a valid question without a reasonable explanation.\n\nWhile letting Jinder get to his feet before Mike Chiota rang the bell is out of the norm for MITB cash ins, it was still the right time. Jinder just received a 'Super AA' (it's like a regular AA, but from the top rope), and looked to be down for a while. The Singh Brothers were gone. It made sense. It actually fit here.\n\nDoing it on a SmackDown was perfect as well. While everyone had their eyes set on 'The Biggest Party of the Summer', Corbin did what the briefcase was intended to do. He shocked the universe with the cash in.\n\nHe did it on a 'go home' show to boot. No one ever anticipates a 'go home' show to have many storylines. It finalizes the card and has a contract signing or two. This one left the entire SummerSlam prediction in chaos.\n\nBy having Corbin lose, it does several things for the career of not just 'The Lone Wolf', but for the WWE Championship picture.\n\nFor one, it puts the SummerSlam card in some intriguing air. Almost everyone had Jinder losing to Nakamura in the Mian Event for SummerSlam with the expectation of a cash-in by Corbin after the match. Now, it looks as though the WWE Championship could stay on the 'Modern Day Maharajah'. While the world is still clamoring for a Shinsuke Title Run, those same people are changing predictions.\n\nFor two, it made Jinder look strong. Just examine this with the facts. Jinder took an AA and kicked out. Then, he took a 'Super AA' and got back to his feet and kept his Championship. Yes, he had help from John Cena, but Jinder pulled off the typical heel win. More importantly, he did something only two other men did. He survived a MITB cash in.\n\nFor three, it takes Corbin down a peg or two. Now, Corbin does not have the pressure of being the MITB case holder. He also now has more of a chip on his shoulder. He can use this loss as fuel to his fire to decimate his opponents. It also gives him an out if his character goes the other way. If he becomes a comedy act, this could be the catalyst. It gives him opportunities (and since SmackDown is the 'Land of Opportunity', it fits) to evolve and be more than just an \"up and comer.\" It can give him depth.\n\nFinally, if Vince decides that he is over Corbin, this could be his ticket out of the WWE. It is no secret that with the exception of a vocal minority, Corbin is not over in any fashion with the WWE Universe. If this becomes the spiral that ultimately leads to a 'future endeavors' tweet, Corbin could go into the indies and be a mega star. He could always come back to the WWE after some 'independent flavoring' and be huge.\n\nIf Vince and the WWE want Corbin to not plummet into Dolph Ziggler territory, he needs to not just beat John Cena but to destroy him. Some fans are already saying the WWE is 'trolling' their fan base by the moves from SmackDown. If they want to make this legit and avoid people seeing this as a shock value maneuver, Corbin needs to look strong.\n\nCena interfered on behalf of a heel. It is a fact. If Cena does not distract Corbin, Jinder does not have the opportunity to roll up Corbin. As such, one begins to wonder if this is maybe one of those small seeds that could lead to a heel turn from WWE's super nova. The WWE needs to continue to tease Cena being a bad boy if they want more than mothers and small children to give a damn about the \"Never Give Up\" movement.\n\nJinder needs to hold the belt. He needs to win this belt thanks to a disqualification because Corbin was getting revenge. He needs to hold onto the main strap and begin a three-way feud with Corbin and Nakamura.

And the Superman of the squared circle has elevated rival after rival in the process.\n\nCena enters Sunday's SummerSlam against Baron Corbin on a surprising losing streak. The powerhouse has suffered six defeats in a row at the marquee pay-pay-view.\n\nForget his reputation among many fans as a guy who \"buries\" other wrestlers and refuses to put over new faces. That hasn't been true in the least at SummerSlam of late.\n\nIt's at this event where WWE has most taken advantage of the career-changing power of beating Cena.\n\nSummerSlam has seen him help turn emerging talent into made men. Daniel Bryan, AJ Styles and CM Punk's careers were all better off thanks to their SummerSlam showdowns with Cena.\n\nAnd the 16-time world champ has churned out a number of classics along the way.\n\nCena vs. Styles last year was arguably the best WWE match of the year. WWE.com named Cena vs. Bryan the No. 2 bout of 2013.\n\nDave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter (h/t the Internet Wrestling Database) rated four of Cena's recent SummerSlam losses 4.25 stars or higher (out of five). The average match rating during this streak is four stars.\n\nCena has made SummerSlam his stage even without a victory to his name at the PPV since 2010.\n\nPunk twice came out on top against Cena at SummerSlam. Those wins solidified the idea that Punk was not only Cena's level but that he had the megastar's number.\n\nCena made the perfect rival for Punk, the corporate-approved Boy Scout to his irreverent rebel.\n\nTheir second SummerSlam meeting came in the midst of Punk's historic 435-day reign as WWE champ. Cena was one of the many foes Punk outsmarted and outlasted, but there's always something special about taking down the golden boy, even in a Triple Threat scenario.\n\nPunk would have never had the momentum he generated had he not had such a major name as his foil, one WWE clearly felt comfortable letting him topple.\n\nBryan's victory at WrestleMania XXX with a pair of championship titles in his hands and confetti raining on him was the climax of a story that began at SummerSlam.\n\nCena selected Bryan as his opponent that year, offering him a shot at the WWE title. Bryan, with a surging fanbase behind him, made the most of it. He and Cena put on a thriller, one where Bryan surprisingly beat Cena in decisive fashion.\n\nBryan wrote in Yes! My Improbable Journey to the Main Event of WrestleMania: \"It was still the biggest moment of my career up until then. Very few people beat John Cena clean in the middle of the ring, and I got to do it in the main event of SummerSlam.\"\n\nBeating Cena helped Bryan looked like a main eventer. It was a key moment on the timeline leading up to his career peak.\n\nLesnar, unlike Bryan and Punk, didn't need to take down Cena to vault himself into the top tier. The Beast Incarnate, though, used an absolute devouring of the champ to become a monster like no other.\n\nHad Lesnar destroyed Alberto Del Rio or Sheamus to capture the WWE title as he did at SummerSlam 2014, it wouldn't have had nearly the impact that steamrolling Cena did.\n\nA flood of suplexes left Cena dizzy, wounded, helpless. Lesnar beat him more emphatically than anyone else ever had.\n\nThe win put Lesnar in a category all his own -- it pushed him toward immortal status.\n\nRollins ended SummerSlam 2015 standing triumphantly in the ring with both the WWE and United States Championships in his grasp.\n\nHis win over Cena was one of the biggest of his career. He had downed an icon, albeit with interference from comedian Jon Stewart, and achieved the rare feat of holding two titles at once. Along the way, going toe to toe with The Cenation Leader, Rollins looked tremendous.\n\nRob McCarron of Voices of Wrestling summed it up perfectly: \"This was a fantastic showcase of Seth Rollins as a credible champion from start to finish...Rollins looked like a star.\"\n\nThat's in large part because of Cena. The powerhouse was not only able to give him a great match on the grand stage; he served as the best hunting trophy on Rollins' wall.\n\nStyles charged into WWE in 2016, making himself comfortable in the company's upper echelon rather quickly.\n\nTangling with Roman Reigns and Chris Jericho certainly helped in that process. But there was no bigger win during Styles' run than the one against Cena at SummerSlam. That victory made it clear Styles was going to a major player.\n\nThe clean win put him in select company.\n\nIt was one Styles used as a key component for his character for weeks. The Phenomenal One incessantly bragged about beating Cena. He demanded to be called The Face That Runs the Place after knocking off the original guy to go by that moniker.\n\nAnd Styles added to his WWE resume with another top-flight performance that night in August. Critics like Miami Herald columnist Scott Fishman raved about the match:\n\nStyles became the latest wrestler to gain momentum from a SummerSlam clash with Cena. A great match and an impressive win catapulted him forward.\n\nWill Corbin get that same treatment on Sunday?\n\nHe sure needs it after failing to win the WWE title despite cashing in his Money in the Bank contract on Tuesday. Recent history suggests that he has a shot to score the biggest win of his career, and win or lose, a stellar showing is likely on the way.\n\nCena has been killing it on SummerSlam, even as his record worsens and his losing streak grows.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T15:54:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.501960813999176, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3364258", "time": "15:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "305589", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miami_Herald", "score": 1}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "311897", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nickname"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickname", "score": 1}, {"id": "315013", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.J.

At one point in the match, Seth performed a running powerbomb and slammed Finn into the safety barrier outside the ring, and disaster struck.\n\nFinn suffered a 180 degree labrum tear, a torn bicep and pectoral tendon, cartilage damage and a fracture to the glenoid neck socket.\n\nThis wasn't enough to thwart The Demon King, however, as he went to defeat Seth Rollins with his patented Coup De Grace and became the first ever WWE Universal Champion.\n\nHe also became the first ever Superstar to relinquish the Title, as his injuries were too severe to continue in the ring for several months.\n\nBalor is currently on the road back to the top, most recently ending his rivalry with Elias and is now in the midst of mind games with The Eater of Worlds, Bray Wyatt, who he faces this Sunday at SummerSlam.\n\nBrock Lesnar was the specimen that blasted on the scene in 2002, attacking Al Snow, Maven and Spike Dudley, with the latter being on the receiving end of a devastating triple powerbomb. And who was by his side? None other than The Advocate, Paul Heyman, who was seen barking orders.\n\nAt the time, Brock was nicknamed \"The Next Big Thing\", and boy were they right. His first feud was with The Hardy Boyz, defeating them at multiple PPVs including Backlash and Judgement Day.\n\nAfter winning the King of the Ring final against RVD, Brock earned his WWE Undisputed Championship shot against The Rock at SummerSlam 2002. Brock executed his own Rock Bottom and F5, and with the help of an interference from Paul Heyman, he landed the big time and won his first championship.\n\nBrock began to make an even bigger name for himself as he went to war with The Undertaker at No Mercy, defeating him in a Hell in a Cell match.\n\nWe all know how The Deadman and The Beast's rivalry progressed in the future.\n\nLesnar went on to feud with Big Show, the feud that led Paul Heyman to betray him. Lesnar would suffer his first pin fall loss to Show at Survivor Series, which catapulted his reputation with the fans, and went on to do great things with the company.\n\nKurt Angle's first appearance at WWE came in 1999, quickly establishing his American Hero character based on his gold medal win at the 1998 Summer Olympics.\n\nAfter his initial stint as a \"good guy\", fans quickly began to boo his entrances, which Kurt quickly capitalised on and turned into a villain, patronising his fellow Superstars and the audience themselves.\n\nJust a year later, Angle won the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, and then losing both titles without ever conceding a fall in a two-pin Triple Threat match at WrestleMania 2000.\n\nWith these two Titles a distant memory, he then became a top-tier Superstar, feuding with The Rock and Triple H which led to a Triple Threat Match at SummerSlam. Angle was stretchered out during the match after a Pedigree through the announcement table.\n\nAs The People's Champion and The King of Kings battled on, Kurt would be brought back in alongside Vince McMahon to take on Triple H, but after a tussle between The Game and Kurt over a sledgehammer, Vince was on the receiving end of a bash.\n\nWith Kurt and Triple H distracted, the Rock threw the American Hero over the ropes, and then pinned The Game after dishing out The People's Elbow.\n\nSummerSlam would be the catalyst to spark his career. He would go on to have a heated rivalry with Triple H, with Kurt frequently interfering in The Game's matches and ruining his title opportunities.\n\nThey'd go on to do battle a week before Unforgiven, as Angle attacked Triple H with a sledgehammer, leading to the American Hero kissing Stephanie McMahon as her husband lay unconscious in the ring.\n\nTriple H earned vengeance at Unforgiven, but Kurt would go on to have one of the greatest rivalries in recent memories against Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n\nSummerSlam 1998 was nicknamed \"Highway to Hell\", with a fierce main card on the table. Stone Cold was due to defend his title against The Undertaker, Ken Shamrock had a huge bout with Owen Hart, and X-Pac battled Jeff Jarret, but it was the two young guns that stole the show - The Rock and Triple H.\n\nThe two up and coming Superstars faced off in a Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title, with carnage ensuing. After weaponising the ladder to both their advantages, Chyna delivered a low blow to The Rock which allowed HHH to win the Intercontinental Title.\n\nUnfortunately, Triple H would be sidelined with a knee injury and gave up the title, but while he was away The Rock went on to win the WWF Championship at Survivor Series.\n\nThe two would reignite their rivalry in an I Quit match, The Rock accompanied by Kane and The Game by Chyna. Much to Triple H's dismay, he was forced to say I Quit to stop Kane chokeslamming Chyna.\n\nHowever, Chyna later attacked Triple H, showing that she planned to betray him all along.\n\nThe Game would then go on to have one of his most memorable heel turns, and become a part of The Corporation.\n\nDaniel Bryan is the Rocky of the WWE Universe - the true underdog story that everyone wanted to succeed. His unconventional looks, his smaller frame, his wild facial hair, it was everything that the WWE hadn't seen in a Title contender before. But nobody resonated with the fans better than the do-or-die Daniel Bryan.\n\nBefore SummerSlam 2013, the Team Hell No tag-team was formed of Bryan and Kane, where they would often bicker between themselves during matches. They would go on to have a successful run as WWE Tag Team Champions, feuding with the likes of Team Rhodes Scholars, 3MB and, later down the line, The Shield, who they lost the titles to.\n\nBryan became obsessed to prove he wasn't the weak link of Team Hell No and launched the \"Yes!' movement, becoming more aggressive in the process.\n\nThis was the year he began to become the Superstar that put his name in lights. After Team Hell No separated, Bryan went on to better Randy Orton in a rivalry, and continued his hot streak by picking up wins over Sheamus and Christian.\n\nThe crowd was pining for Bryan to win the Money in the Bank that year, but was foiled by Curtis Axel, a non-participant, with Randy Orton picking up the win.\n\nHowever, the crowd would have their dreams come true as John Cena picked Bryan to be his opponent at SummerSlam 2013. This is where The Corporation began to dampen any hopes Bryan would have at victory by psychologically and physically damaging him. Bryan was labelled the 'B+ Player', he was put through gauntlet matches, and was made to face his old tag-team partner Kane.\n\nNone of that mattered, as Cena and Bryan went hammer and tong, as the Yes Man beat the odds to become the WWE Champion. Special referee Triple H, however, had other plans, and planted a Pedigree to Bryan. Orton would cash in his Money in the Bank and cut the title reign short.\n\nSummerSlam would further propel his connection with the crowd, and went on to create the biggest atmospheres in stadiums across the world from his matches - he'd feud with The Corporation, Randy Orton, and the up and coming Bray Wyatt.\n\nBryan would go on to main event WrestleMania XXX, defeating Batista and Randy Orton in a Triple Threat Match to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T23:09:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 792, "textStart": 785, "imp": true, "date":

As the bell rang, he punched Cena and was then rolled up by Mahal, getting pinned and causing Corbin to fail his cash-in.\n\nSome people could argue that Cena caused Corbin to lose the match, but from the live broadcast, it looked like Corbin got easily distracted which allowed Jinder to roll Corbin up and make him the third person to fail a cash-in. It makes all of the fans watching feel stupid for caring about Corbin winning the Money in the Bank when they made him fail the cash in such anti-climactic fashion.\n\nBefore cashing in Money in the Bank, Baron Corbin was scheduled to face John Cena at SummerSlam. If having Baron fail his cash in was to give his match with Cena more of a reason to happen, then that it is just stupid.\n\nBaron Corbin against John Cena is one of the less important matches at SummerSlam and having Corbin cash in unsuccessfully before the show proves that maybe WWE didn't really have any plans for Corbin to become WWE Champion.\n\nHaving Cena defeat Corbin at SummerSlam is a result that he can never come back from. If Corbin loses, especially clean, to Cena at SummerSlam, I would not be surprised if Baron Corbin ends up getting released in the next batch of \"budget cuts\".\n\nLosing to Cena will definitely be the final nail in the coffin that is Corbin's career. There is no way that he can come back from that, especially after losing his cash-in match.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T14:54:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.4627451002597809, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3365109", "time": "14:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3364258", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 3}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 4}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "339509", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pin (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 4}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 2}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 4}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 3}, {"id": "684004", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Money in the Bank ladder match"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_ladder_match", "score": 3}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 3}], "image": "https://realsport101.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/112_SD_08152017jg_1080-a6be11b260828b69cf5593667f8bc52e.jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:41:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Baron Corbin: why losing to Cena could be the final nail in his coffin - RealSport", "originalArticle": null}

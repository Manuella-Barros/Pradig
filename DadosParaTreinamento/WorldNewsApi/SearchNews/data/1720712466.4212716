The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percent.With the district's primary on June 25, and ballots already printed and reaching voters, local Republican leaders like Douglas County Republican Party chair Steve Peck said Boebert's name recognition will help her. \"I think it just boils down to\u2014even though she's not an incumbent from this seat\u2014it's incredibly strong\" to have that status, Peck told The Denver Post. He added, \"It's a combination of high name ID, having access to the committees and votes, political intel and then, of course, donors. Donors want to back a strong horse.\"Peck emphasized Boebert's connection to the former president and presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Trump, telling the Post: \"The base of the Republican Party has been demanding change for a long time, and we don't feel like we've been heard. People like Lauren Boebert and Donald Trump acknowledge the base. They hear the base. They don't say one thing and do the other.\"Newsweek contacted the Douglas County Republican Party's contact form to request comment on Sunday morning.Denver-based GOP strategist and political analyst Kelly Maher, told the Post \"I don't see a path for anyone else,\" implying that Boebert will win the upcoming primary.While Douglas County Commissioner George Teal, who initially did not back Boebert, said \"Four of every 10 Republicans I'm talking to love Lauren,\" noting that \"It's not a majority, but it's an absolute plurality.\" He told The Denver Post that \"Lauren\u2014they love what she says, they love the issues she's willing to die for.

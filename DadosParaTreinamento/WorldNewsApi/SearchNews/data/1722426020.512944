And the sound reverberating from inside the casting room as he waited to read for \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d the new sitcom from Charlie Day of \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\u201d made him downright nervous. \u201cI just heard peals of laughter \u2014 peals! \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing worse for an actor than to hear the other guy doing that well,\u201d he recalled. But when the door opened, it was David Alan Grier, one of Mr. Mull\u2019s best friends, and a potential co-star. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to do this together.\u2019\u201d In \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d airing Fridays on Fox, Mr. Mull plays Charlie, a former rambling man, who, with Mr. Grier as the overly opinionated Hank, and Leslie Jordan as the hedonistic Sid, forms a squad operating under the delusion that they\u2019re the kings of their retirement community. Then Jerry, their regular dining companion, dies \u2014 leaving an empty seat at their table. And when the brash Margaret, played by Vicki Lawrence, quickly slides into it, the inevitable high jinks erupt. They\u2019re insistent that she move, she\u2019s insistent that she won\u2019t, and soon \u201cthe four of us are the junta running the place,\u201d he said.", "summary": "The wry Mr. Mull talks about his latest sitcom, \u201cThe Cool Kids\u201d; growing old; \u201cRoseanne\u201d; and the current state of Hollywood.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/arts/television/martin-mull-cool-kids.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/07/arts/07snapshot-mull/07snapshot-mull-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=14f04d30c99c3ba0015543c67da049351895cb576677a2907fad97b6205df522&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:27:25", "author": "Kathryn Shattuck", "authors": ["Kathryn Shattuck"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.068}

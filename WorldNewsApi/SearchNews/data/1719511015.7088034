Jamal\u2019s dad, Jamal Bryant, Sr. was told by the school over the phone that \u201cit would be best\u201d to go straight to the emergency room where the paramedics were taking Jamal Jr. Once his dad, and mum, Taylor Hicks arrived at Southeast Georgia Health System they found out that their child had coded two times and died, and neither have heard a word from the daycare since the incident. Taylor said: \u201cI trusted you all to do your job. And now I blame myself and I wish I never dropped him off that day. And I don't wanna hear anything from them because they should've called. Nothing's gonna fix this, other than them being done.\u201d Georgia's Department of Early Care and Learning closed Kids Nest Learning Center regarding concerns around the health, safety and welfare of children in their care, saying they would be in \u201cimminent danger\u201d if it stayed open. It said: \u201cFirst aid and CPR are deferred because during the follow-up visits, we do not evaluate all rules. It would be evaluated at the next unannounced regulatory visit.\u201d The daycare has until May 28 to appeal the agency's decision. A Change.org petition was created for the 'Immediate and Permanent Closure' of the learning centre, which had 250 signatures on Sunday. The petition said similar events had occurred before at the centre, including when Manjeet Grant, the director of Kid's Nest Learning Center, was arrested and charged with first-degree cruelty to children following an incident that took place in March 2022. Glynn County police arrested Grant after she \u201cslapped (a child) across the face, knocking her to the ground\u201d according to an arrest report. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . The Brunswick News reported that the child's mother filed a civilian warrant application against Grant on May 16, the day after the alleged incident. On March 17, Georgia's Department of Early Care and Learning announced that they were investigating the alleged slapping. According to the petition, the facility had 22 inspection reports filed by the agency since January 2022. Jamal Sr. said that he wasn't aware of the shortcomings of the centre saying he would remember his son as \u201cfull of energy\u201d, adding he wants to \u201cmake sure this doesn't happen to another child again. \u201cWe had so many plans for him. We were just talking about his first haircut and everything. We won't be able to do that.\u201d He added, \u201cDon't take life for granted\u201d as Jamal Jr\u2019s mum said \u201cAnd hug your babies every day.\u201d The Mirror has approached the Kids Nest Learning Center for comment.", "summary": "Jamal Jr. walked up to member os staff to show them that he was choking, the supervisors tried to get the watermelon out of his mouth but had to call an ambulance for assistance.", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/baby-chokes-parenting-daycare-hospital-32896402", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896389.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_16-month-old-baby-chokes-to-death-on-piece-of-watermelon-at-daycareJamal-Allen-Bryant-Jr-died-on.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:34:39", "author": "Emilia Randall,Emilia-randall", "authors": ["Emilia Randall", "Emilia-randall"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.677}

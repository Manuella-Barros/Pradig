These two items helped the market get back on its feet over the past few trading days.\n\nThe Fed's narrative was less hawkish than many feared, said Archibald.\n\n\"Even if inflation ticked up a little bit from here they're not likely to raise rates again,\" he said. \"So I think that's really what's driven the move lower in bond yields.\"\n\nSince the jobs report, markets are considering again that the Fed could cut rates twice in 2024, after previously paring back expectations to just one, said Archibald.\n\n\"Obviously, the macro environment is still weighing heavily on the direction for stocks,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we're just going to be in this world ... where every data point is going to be probably over-scrutinized.\"\n\nEarnings overall in the U.S. have been better than expected, said Archibald. As the year progresses, he thinks investors could shift their preferences somewhat away from technology and toward financial, resource and industrial companies.\n\n\"I'm not saying technology's going to do poorly, but it might underperform the market a little bit here.\"\n\nIn Canada, earnings season is in full swing this week, with a number of large companies -- Brookfield, Shopify, Manulife and WSP Global among them -- set to report, said Archibald.\n\nThe Canadian economy is much more tied to resources than the U.S. economy, he noted.\n\n\"(It) looks like we should start to build on a little bit of the momentum that we saw last quarter with respect to commodity earnings reports,\" he said.\n\nOil is a big topic right now, he added, with an OPEC meeting later this week, Israel mounting its offensive on Rafah, and the U.S. looking to replenish its reserves.\n\nThe Canadian dollar traded for 72.97 cents US compared with 73.20 cents US on Monday.\n\nThe June crude oil contract

The S&P 500 index was up 6.96 points at 5,187.70, while the Nasdaq composite was down 16.69 points at 16,332.56.\n\nU.S. markets are in consolidation mode as they digest the events of last week, said Mike Archibald, vice-president and portfolio manager with AGF Investments Inc.\n\nWith no important economic data this week and earnings season coming to a close, \"the underlying tone to the market is one of a little bit more defensive sector leadership, as well as some interest-rate sensitive parts of the market,\" said Archibald.\n\nTreasury yields have eased since last week, which saw the U.S. Federal Reserve hold its key interest rate steady as well as a weaker-than-expected jobs report. These two items helped the market get back on its feet over the past few trading days.\n\nThe Fed's narrative was less hawkish than many feared, said Archibald.\n\n\"Even if inflation ticked up a little bit from here they're not likely to raise rates again,\" he said. \"So I think that's really what's driven the move lower in bond yields.\"\n\nSince the jobs report, markets are considering again that the Fed could cut rates twice in 2024, after previously paring back expectations to just one, said Archibald.\n\n\"Obviously, the macro environment is still weighing heavily on the direction for stocks,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we're just going to be in this world ... where every data point is going to be probably over-scrutinized.\"\n\nEarnings overall in the U.S. have been better than expected, said Archibald. As the year progresses, he thinks investors could shift their preferences somewhat away from technology and toward financial, resource and industrial companies.\n\n\"I'm not saying technology's going to do poorly, but it might underperform the market a little bit here.\"\n\nIn Canada, earnings season is in full swing this week, with a number of large companies -- Brookfield, Shopify, Manulife and WSP Global among them -- set to report, said Archibald.\n\nThe Canadian economy is much more tied to resources than the U.S. economy, he noted.\n\n\"(It) looks like we should start to build on a little bit of the momentum that we saw last quarter with respect to commodity earnings reports,\" he said.\n\nOil is a big topic right now, he added, with an OPEC meeting later this week, Israel mounting its offensive on Rafah, and the U.S. looking to replenish its reserves.\n\nThe Canadian dollar traded for 72.97 cents US compared with 73.20 cents US on Monday.\n\nThe June crude oil contract

The S&P 500 index was down 0.03 points at 5,187.67, while the Nasdaq composite was down 29.80 points at 16,302.76.\n\nShopify reported a loss in its first quarter despite increased revenue. The company also forecast slower revenue growth for the next quarter.\n\nShopify is the biggest tech company on the TSX and a major weight on the index, said Jennifer Tozser, senior wealth adviser and portfolio manager with Tozser Wealth Management at National Bank Financial Wealth Management.\n\nThe company's earnings weren't bad, but its future growth outlook wasn't as rosy as investors hoped for, said Tozser.\n\nShopify is one of many companies that did well during the pandemic and is now grappling with what its post-COVID future looks like, she said.\n\nAs Canadian earnings season gets underway, Tozser said she isn't expecting a lot of surprises.\n\n\"That's why the Shopify one is so unique ... because it's not a sector that there's a lot of depth in in Canada,\" she said.\n\nThe TSX information technology index fell 4.2 per cent Wednesday, while most other sectors posted modest gains.\n\nEarnings continued to trickle in south of the border as the U.S. season draws to a close.\n\nUber Technologies saw its share price slump after its results fell short of analysts' expectations, while Lyft shares rose after beating expectations.\n\nTozser thinks markets will see a sector rotation once central banks start cutting interest rates, favouring companies in sectors like industrial, consumer discretionary and REITs.\n\nIn Canada, rate cuts could begin as soon as June, with weaker economic data putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to ease off, said Tozser.\n\nMeanwhile, cuts in the U.S. aren't expected until near the end of the year.\n\nThat puts the Bank of Canada in a difficult spot, Tozser said.\n\n\"The concern is that if we cut and the U.S. doesn't, we're going to trash our currency,\" she said.\n\nThe Canadian dollar traded for 72.81 cents US

And that's especially true with Shopify,\" he said.\n\n\"Clearly the market was taken by surprise by just how weak their forward outlook was.\"\n\nIn the U.S., where earnings season is almost over, it's been mostly positive surprises, added Burkett.\n\nThough this week is thin on major economic data, one report showed that in the U.S., the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week.\n\nThat follows a recent weaker-than-expected jobs report in the U.S., as investors continue to take bad economic news as good news for interest rate cuts.\n\n\"(At) the end of last year, everyone was expecting imminent rate cuts, and that has absolutely not come to pass. And the reason it has not come to pass is because earnings have been pretty resilient, business conditions have remained good,\" said Burkett.\n\nCuts are expected much sooner in Canada, where economic data has shown more signs of slowing.\n\nBut there are concerns that the central banks are holding off on cuts for too long, said Burkett, given the lag effect of higher interest rates.\n\nThe Bank of Canada's Financial Stability Report released Thursday said Canadians continue to adjust to higher interest rates, with more mortgage holders in the coming years set to renew at higher rates.\n\n\"We're seeing now more and more of those mortgages come up for renewal, and renewal at significantly higher rates,\" said Burkett.\n\nThe Canadian dollar traded for 73.04 cents US

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIn New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 331.37 points at 39,387.76. The S&P 500 index was up 26.41 points at 5,214.08, while the Nasdaq composite was up 43.51 points at 16,346.26.\n\nCanadian companies reporting earnings Thursday included Canadian Tire, which warned of waning consumer demand, as well as Telus, Quebecor and Manulife.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis earnings season in both Canada and the U.S. has been characterized by stronger-than-expected results, but cautious outlooks from firms, said Kevin Burkett, portfolio manager at Victoria-based Burkett Asset Management.\n\nWednesday's report from Shopify, which saw its share price down almost 20 per cent that day, was a prime example, said Burkett.\n\n\"Their earnings weren't so much the trouble, it was weak guidance,\" he said, adding the stock slide \"dragged down the TSX.\"\n\nThe markets are responding positively to earnings beats, but much more harshly to misses, added Burkett.\n\n\"I think investors are generally waiting and watching earnings for indication of where we are in the economic cycle. And that's especially true with Shopify,\" he said.\n\n\"Clearly the market was taken by surprise by just how weak their forward outlook was.\"\n\nIn the U.S., where earnings season is almost over, it's been mostly positive surprises, added Burkett.\n\nThough this week is thin on major economic data, one report showed that in the U.S., the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week.\n\nThat follows a recent weaker-than-expected jobs report in the U.S., as investors continue to take bad economic news as good news for interest rate cuts.\n\n\"(At) the end of last year, everyone was expecting imminent rate cuts, and that has absolutely not come to pass. And the reason it has not come to pass is because earnings have been pretty resilient, business conditions have remained good,\" said Burkett.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCuts are expected much sooner in Canada, where economic data has shown more signs of slowing.\n\nBut there are concerns that the central banks are holding off on cuts for too long, said Burkett, given the lag effect of higher interest rates.\n\nThe Bank of Canada's Financial Stability Report released Thursday said Canadians continue to adjust to higher interest rates, with more mortgage holders in the coming years set to renew at higher rates.\n\n\"We're seeing now more and more of those mortgages come up for renewal, and renewal at significantly higher rates,\" said Burkett.\n\nThe Canadian dollar traded for 73.04 cents UScompared with 72.81 cents on Wednesday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe June crude oil contract was up 27 cents at US$79.26 per barrel and the June natural gas contract was up 11 cents at US$2.30 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nThe June gold contract was up US$18.00 at US$2,340.30 an ounce and the July copper contract was up five cents at US$4.59 a pound.\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 9, 2024.\n\nCompanies in this story: (TSX:GSPTSE,

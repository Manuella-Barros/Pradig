Jim Pillen's plan to cut property taxes will go before the Revenue Committee later this week after lawmakers voted on Monday to change its committee assignment.\n\nThe Legislature's Referencing Committee voted 6-3 to move LB1 out of the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, where it was assigned in a surprise move last week, and into the Revenue Committee.\n\nIn the committee led by Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of Elkhorn, who introduced LB1 on Pillen's behalf on the first day of a special session called by the governor, the bill will likely have an easier path to the floor of the Legislature.\n\nThe move also gives any amendments proposed by the Revenue Committee priority when the bill comes up for debate by the full Legislature.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Jim Pillen defends tax plan, personal gain Nebraska's Ty Robinson, Lincoln company prove clever NIL deals do still exist\n\nSen. Ray Aguilar of Grand Island, the chairman of the Executive Board, which also serves as the Referencing Committee, and Sen. John Lowe of Kearney voted to move LB1 to the Revenue Committee, where Revisor of Statutes Marcia McClurg recommended it be referenced.\n\nBoth senators had previously voted to reference LB1 to the Government Committee, which has jurisdiction over matters affecting political subdivisions, because of how it affected city and county governments.\n\nBackers of Pillen's plan said the move was an attempt to kill LB1 or block it from advancing to the floor. At least half of the members of the Government Committee have voiced skepticism or opposition to Pillen's plan.\n\nOn Monday, Lowe said a letter from Linehan and Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon, the chairman of the Government Committee, requesting LB1 be re-referenced swayed him to change his thinking.\n\n\"I always respect two committee chairs coming together,\" Lowe said.\n\nOpposing the re-referencing motion were Omaha Sen. Tony Vargas, Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston and Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar.\n\nPillen's plan would implement a 5.5% sales tax on previously untaxed goods and services, a 4% tax on real property maintenance and repairs, a 2% tax on purchase and repair of agricultural machinery, and raise taxes on candy, soda, cigarettes and alcohol.\n\nIt also eliminates school districts' ability to levy property taxes and caps growth on property tax revenue for cities and counties.\n\nThe Revenue Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the bill at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe Referencing Committee on Monday also debated where to assign a bill (LB29) from Sen. Jen Day of Gretna requiring the sale of a state-owned plane valued at $3.6 million used by Pillen and members of the executive branch.\n\nUnder Day's plan, the funds from the sale would be returned to the state's general fund and put toward property tax relief efforts -- the stated purpose of the special session.\n\nThe plane made approximately 50 flights this summer, often staying in the air for less than 30 minutes. On July 25, the first day of the special session, the Beech C90GTx King Air flew three flights connecting Lincoln, Beatrice and Nebraska City.\n\nDay said the state should consider cutting non-essential spending before slashing $200 million from programs like those focused on foster children first.\n\n\"If property tax relief is as important to the governor as he says it is, I would hope we would look at luxuries before essentials,\" Day said.\n\nLincoln Sen. Eliot Bostar argued the Executive Board previously handled the task of deciding which plane the state would purchase more than a decade ago and that the question should remain with the nine-member committee now.\n\nThe motion to reference it to the Executive Board failed 3-6, however, with Bostar, Lincoln Sen. Beau Ballard and Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte voting in support.\n\nSenators then voted 8-1 to reference the bill to the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Nebraska Department of Transportation's aeronautics division.\n\nBostar cast the lone vote against the motion.\n\nTop Journal Star photos for July 2024\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7120 or cdunker@journalstar.com.\n\nOn Twitter @ChrisDunkerLJS\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Jim Pillen contends.\n\nNebraska Chamber of Commerce President Bryan Slone made the argument during the first day of public hearings on bills introduced during the special legislative session that started Thursday. He testified on behalf of the state, Omaha and Lincoln Chambers of Commerce.\n\nWhile Slone said he is a \"very unhappy property taxpayer personally,\" he cited figures from the national Tax Foundation showing property taxes account for a similar share of state and local taxes paid in Nebraska as in neighboring states and urged lawmakers to spend more time studying the problem before taking what he called risky action.\n\n\"We don't have a $2 billion problem,\" he said, referring to the amount of property taxes that Pillen has targeted for cutting. \"There isn't a need to reduce property taxes 40% to be competitive.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He supported a proposal to ratchet down the maximum school property tax levy over the next decade.\n\n\"This is a path that makes sense,\" he said.\n\nThat plan, introduced by State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, drew the most interest of the seven bills heard Monday. The seven addressed property taxes, the focus of the special session, in a variety of ways. They did not include Pillen's proposal, which is scheduled for a hearing Tuesday.\n\nThe governor's plan would create a new property tax credit worth $2.03 billion in the first year, aimed at offsetting school property taxes but distributed based on property valuation rather than the amount of school taxes paid by property owners. It would pay for the credit by increasing or imposing sales taxes and sin taxes on a number of goods and services, bringing in about $900 million, while capping property tax revenues collected by cities and counties.\n\nThe plan would leave major issues to be addressed by future lawmakers, including how to fulfill Pillen's goal of having state dollars replace property taxes for school operating costs. Legislative Bill 1, introduced on his behalf by Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Omaha area, would state the Legislature's intent to revamp the state school aid formula before the 2026-27 school year.\n\nAmong the seven bills heard Monday were measures setting a higher income tax rate for the wealthiest Nebraskans, creating a special tax on luxury items, raising cigarette taxes and offering income tax credits to renters who would not get direct benefit from property tax reductions.\n\nHughes' LB 9, which she called the \"Lower the Levy Cap\" bill, could offer an alternative to Pillen's plan. She said it would provide Nebraskans with stable, sustainable property tax relief, while preserving local control of schools.\n\nThe measure would trigger additional state aid for schools and force reductions in the amount of property taxes schools would be allowed to collect. She said the approach was better than the bill Pillen is pushing.\n\n\"I don't feel we're going to fix our way out of this problem with a tax credit,\" she said. \"The maximum levy cap for schools is the ultimate hard cap.\"\n\nUnder her plan, the school levy lid would drop from the current $1.05 down to 65 cents next year, then drop another 10 cents every two years until it reaches 25 cents in 2033. The lower lids would trigger additional state aid for schools and reduce the disparities in tax levies from district to district. It also would make changes in the state school aid formula to direct more aid to agricultural-based districts.\n\nLB 9 drew support from agricultural groups, including the Nebraska Farm Bureau and Nebraska Farmers Union, and from some education representatives. Other education leaders, including groups representing school boards, school administrators and teachers, took neutral positions, saying they wanted to see models of how the bill would affect individual school districts.\n\nSpencer Head, speaking for the Omaha Public Schools, objected to two provisions of the bill. One would eliminate the averaging adjustment, a factor in the state school aid formula that helps larger districts with lower than average per-school spending. The other would steer aid too much in the direction of rural districts.\n\nmartha.stoddard@owh.com, 402-670-2402, twitter.com/stoddardOWH\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay

Ray Aguilar of Grand Island, the chairman of the Executive Board, which also serves as the Referencing Committee, and Sen. John Lowe of Kearney voted to move LB1 to the Revenue Committee, where Revisor of Statutes Marcia McClurg recommended it be referenced.\n\nBoth senators had previously voted to reference LB1 to the Government Committee, which has jurisdiction over matters affecting political subdivisions, because of how it affected city and county governments.\n\nBackers of Pillen's plan said the move was an attempt to kill LB1 or block it from advancing to the floor. At least half of the members of the Government Committee have voiced skepticism or opposition to Pillen's plan.\n\nOn Monday, Lowe said a letter from Linehan and Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon, the chairman of the Government Committee, requesting LB1 be re-referenced swayed him to change his thinking.\n\n\"I always respect two committee chairs coming together,\" Lowe said.\n\nOpposing the re-referencing motion were Omaha Sen. Tony Vargas, Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston and Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar.\n\nPillen's plan would implement a 5.5% sales tax on previously untaxed goods and services, a 4% tax on real property maintenance and repairs, a 2% tax on purchase and repair of agricultural machinery, and raise taxes on candy, soda, cigarettes and alcohol.\n\nIt also eliminates school districts' ability to levy property taxes and caps growth on property tax revenue for cities and counties.\n\nThe Revenue Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the bill at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe Referencing Committee on Monday also debated where to assign a bill (LB29) from Sen. Jen Day of Gretna requiring the sale of a state-owned plane valued at $3.6 million used by Pillen and members of the executive branch.\n\nUnder Day's plan, the funds from the sale would be returned to the state's general fund and put toward property tax relief efforts -- the stated purpose of the special session.\n\nThe plane made approximately 50 flights this summer, often staying in the air for less than 30 minutes. On July 25, the first day of the special session, the Beech C90GTx King Air flew three flights connecting Lincoln, Beatrice and Nebraska City.\n\nDay said the state should consider cutting non-essential spending before slashing $200 million from programs like those focused on foster children first.\n\n\"If property tax relief is as important to the governor as he says it is, I would hope we would look at luxuries before essentials,\" Day said.\n\nLincoln Sen. Eliot Bostar argued the Executive Board previously handled the task of deciding which plane the state would purchase more than a decade ago and that the question should remain with the nine-member committee now.\n\nThe motion to reference it to the Executive Board failed 3-6, however, with Bostar, Lincoln Sen. Beau Ballard and Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte voting in support.\n\nSenators then voted 8-1 to reference the bill to the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Nebraska Department of Transportation's aeronautics division.\n\nBostar cast the lone vote against the motion.\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7120 or cdunker@journalstar.com.\n\nOn Twitter

Jim Pillen contends.\n\nNebraska Chamber of Commerce President Bryan Slone made the argument during the first day of public hearings on bills introduced during the special legislative session that started Thursday. He testified on behalf of the state, Omaha and Lincoln Chambers of Commerce.\n\nWhile Slone said he is a \"very unhappy property taxpayer personally,\" he cited figures from the national Tax Foundation showing property taxes account for a similar share of state and local taxes paid in Nebraska as in neighboring states and urged lawmakers to spend more time studying the problem before taking what he called risky action.\n\n\"We don't have a $2 billion problem,\" he said, referring to the amount of property taxes that Pillen has targeted for cutting. \"There isn't a need to reduce property taxes 40% to be competitive.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He supported a proposal to ratchet down the maximum school property tax levy over the next decade.\n\n\"This is a path that makes sense,\" he said.\n\nThat plan, introduced by State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, drew the most interest of the seven bills heard Monday. The seven addressed property taxes, the focus of the special session, in a variety of ways. They did not include Pillen's proposal, which is scheduled for a hearing Tuesday.\n\nThe governor's plan would create a new property tax credit worth $2.03 billion in the first year, aimed at offsetting school property taxes but distributed based on property valuation rather than the amount of school taxes paid by property owners. It would pay for the credit by increasing or imposing sales taxes and sin taxes on a number of goods and services, bringing in about $900 million, while capping property tax revenues collected by cities and counties.\n\nThe plan would leave major issues to be addressed by future lawmakers, including how to fulfill Pillen's goal of having state dollars replace property taxes for school operating costs. Legislative Bill 1, introduced on his behalf by Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Omaha area, would state the Legislature's intent to revamp the state school aid formula before the 2026-27 school year.\n\nAmong the seven bills heard Monday were measures setting a higher income tax rate for the wealthiest Nebraskans, creating a special tax on luxury items, raising cigarette taxes and offering income tax credits to renters who would not get direct benefit from property tax reductions.\n\nHughes' LB 9, which she called the \"Lower the Levy Cap\" bill, could offer an alternative to Pillen's plan. She said it would provide Nebraskans with stable, sustainable property tax relief, while preserving local control of schools.\n\nThe measure would trigger additional state aid for schools and force reductions in the amount of property taxes schools would be allowed to collect. She said the approach was better than the bill Pillen is pushing.\n\n\"I don't feel we're going to fix our way out of this problem with a tax credit,\" she said. \"The maximum levy cap for schools is the ultimate hard cap.\"\n\nUnder her plan, the school levy lid would drop from the current $1.05 down to 65 cents next year, then drop another 10 cents every two years until it reaches 25 cents in 2033. The lower lids would trigger additional state aid for schools and reduce the disparities in tax levies from district to district. It also would make changes in the state school aid formula to direct more aid to agricultural-based districts.\n\nLB 9 drew support from agricultural groups, including the Nebraska Farm Bureau and Nebraska Farmers Union, and from some education representatives. Other education leaders, including groups representing school boards, school administrators and teachers, took neutral positions, saying they wanted to see models of how the bill would affect individual school districts.\n\nSpencer Head, speaking for the Omaha Public Schools, objected to two provisions of the bill. One would eliminate the averaging adjustment, a factor in the state school aid formula that helps larger districts with lower than average per-school spending. The other would steer aid too much in the direction of rural districts.\n\nmartha.stoddard@owh.com, 402-670-2402, twitter.com/stoddardOWH\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet

A legislative session has begun to introduce and discuss a relevant bill.\n\nA proposal that has emerged as a potential alternative to Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen's controversial property tax relief plan won cautious support from several key interest groups at a public hearing Monday, which marked Day 3 of the special legislative session Pillen called to take up property tax reform.\n\nDrafted by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and introduced by Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, the bill (LB9) would lower the maximum property tax rate local school districts could levy by 80 cents over the course of a decade -- a 76% cut to the primary driver of high property tax bills in Nebraska.\n\nThe proposal calls for the maximum levy amount per $100 of taxable valuation of property to drop from $1.05 now to 65 cents next year before gradually reducing to 25 cents by 2034.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the legislation leaves crucial questions over how to fund the remaining $440 million balance unanswered.\n\nThat's on purpose, Hughes told the committee Monday.\n\n\"I didn't want to kill the bill by putting in a revenue source,\" she said.\n\nInstead, she hopes Nebraska's single-house Legislature can come to a consensus on how to fund the balance of the plan -- a task that has proved difficult this year at the Capitol, where lawmakers in April sank Pillen's initial tax plan over its reliance on the elimination of numerous sales tax exemptions.\n\nThe governor has doubled down on his plan, proposing new legislation this month that relies on the same sales tax increases that have drawn steady opposition from various industry groups and lawmakers whose support he would need for his bill to become law.\n\nBut Hughes' plan -- which she drafted alongside Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, Myron Dorn of Adams and Lynn Walz of Fremont, all of whom are co-sponsors of the legislation -- has so far avoided the opposition that has plagued Pillen's plan.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, lawmakers who in April championed Pillen's proposal praised the concept offered by Hughes.\n\nSen. Lou Ann Linehan of Elkhorn, the Revenue Committee chairwoman who introduced Pillen's plan on the governor's behalf last week, called LB9 \"impressive.\" Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul, a Pillen appointee, told Hughes: \"Your plan is a good plan.\"\n\nAnd key groups that have signaled public opposition to the governor's plan -- including the Nebraska Farmers Union and Nebraska Farm Bureau -- testified as proponents of the Hughes' proposal or offered cautious support while testifying in a neutral capacity.\n\nBruce Rieker, the top lobbyist for the Farm Bureau who testified in support of LB9 on behalf of that group and eight other agricultural groups in the state, said the plan \"contains several components that address our state's overreliance on property taxes\" and praised its incremental approach.\n\n\"We want this to be right, even if it doesn't mean right now,\" Rieker told lawmakers. \"And we would rather see you put the state on a trajectory that makes this meaningful and sustainable, and that you do it in a thoughtful and deliberate way.\"\n\nAmong others who testified in support of LB9 at Monday's hearing were representatives from the Nebraska Rural Community Schools Association, Schools Taking Action for Nebraska Childrens' Education and several school districts across the state, including Centennial Public School, which serves about 500 students in Utica.\n\nJason Richters, a farmer and the Centennial Public School Board president, praised the bill's maintenance of local control of public schools, which has emerged as a chief concern hanging over Pillen's plan to cut property taxes by putting nearly all public school funding in the hands of the state.\n\n\"Nebraskans are passionate about maintaining local control of their schools and the education offered to their children,\" Richters said. \"I believe they're unwilling to jeopardize that for a few more dollars in tax relief.\"\n\nRepresentatives from the Nebraska State Education Association, the Nebraska Association of County Officials and the state Association of School Boards praised Hughes' plan but withheld full endorsements as they wait for further details to be ironed out.\n\n\"There's a lot here to support,\" said Colby Coash, a lobbyist for the school board group and the Nebraska Council of School Administrators.\n\nWhile groups from the public sector broadly voiced support of the plan, business groups lined up in opposition.\n\nBryan Slone, the president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, said the group's \"biggest issue\" with LB9 is that it fails to identify the scale of the problem lawmakers were recalled to Lincoln to fix.\n\n\"Which is: How big is our property tax problem?\" Slone said. \"Do we need to reduce property taxes by 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 percent to be competitive with other states? It would be nice to define that before we start raising the (sales and/or income) taxes.\"\n\nIncome, property and sales taxes make up the \"three-legged stool\" that defines state revenues, which have grown increasingly reliant on property taxes as lawmakers have passed corporate and individual income tax cuts in recent years.\n\nIn the fiscal year that ended June 30, the state's total net tax revenues included $3.6 billion in sales taxes, $4.2 million in income taxes and $5.1 billion in property taxes.\n\nIncome tax revenues are projected to drop by $1 billion by 2027 as a result of prior tax cuts, but Pillen has made \"transformational\" property tax cuts the top priority of his second year as Nebraska's governor.\n\n\"I'm not saying there isn't a property tax problem,\" Slone said Monday. \"But when we say we need to reduce property taxes by 40 or 50 percent to be competitive, that's just not true.\"\n\nThe Lincoln Independent Business Association and the conservative fiscal group The Platte Institute also opposed Hughes' plan Monday.\n\nAnd the otherwise warm reception LB9 received at Monday's hearing could sour when new revenue streams become part of the legislation.\n\nIn an exchange with Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Rieker, the Farm Bureau's lobbyist, acknowledged that the group would no longer support the plan if the bill included new sales taxes on agricultural inputs or equipment to fund property tax relief.\n\n\"That would be a career-ending move on my part,\" Rieker joked.\n\nThe exchange highlights the challenge lawmakers will face in trying to identify new revenue streams without angering influential industry groups and threatening the popularity of any property tax relief proposal.\n\nBut lawmakers will have numerous revenue-generating proposals to consider when they begin deliberations next week, including new ideas put forward Monday, which marked the last day senators could introduce legislation to be considered during the special legislative session.\n\nLawmakers have introduced 81 bills and 24 constitutional amendments to be considered this session, including 64 pieces of legislation put forward Monday. Among the latest batch of proposals:\n\nMARIJUANA LEGALIZATION: Two Omaha senators proposed legalizing and taxing marijuana for recreational use.\n\nSen. Justin Wayne proposed (LB52) setting a 25% excise tax on cultivators who sell or transfer unprocessed cannabis to manufacturers or stores, as well as a 25% sales tax to be paid by consumers.\n\nThe proceeds from Wayne's bill, after expenses to administer the Cannabis Control Act, would be directed into the Education Future Fund which provides an equal amount of funding for all public school students in Nebraska.\n\nSen. Terrell McKinney proposed (LB71) a 16% excise and sales tax on cannabis products in Nebraska.\n\nUnder McKinney's bill, 50% of the proceeds from the sales tax would be transferred to the property tax credit cash fund and 40% would go to the Education Future Fund used to support public schools. The remainder would be used for grants tied to business development, prisoner reentry, education and youth outreach.\n\nMANSION TAX: Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue sponsored a bill (LB36) implementing a 1.25% real estate transfer tax on all single-family homes valued at more than $800,000.\n\nLUXURY TAXES: Nebraskans would pay more in taxes on a slew of luxury items under a bill (LB54) from Wayne. Among the luxury items taxed at 2.25% included in the legislation are vehicles over $50,000; jewelry that costs more than $5,000; clothing that costs more than $1,000.\n\nMore expensive vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, and jewelry and clothing would also be subject to higher tax rates, under Wayne's plan.\n\nCAPITAL GAINS: Unrealized capital gains for individuals, corporations, or others would be taxed at 10% beginning in 2025, under a bill (LB51) from Wayne, with that amount declining to 8% in 2026 and 7% in 2027.\n\nEXCISE TAX ON AMMO: Wayne also introduced a bill (LB65) that would add a 5% excise tax on all purchases of ammunition in Nebraska.\n\nHalf of the revenue generated would go to the Property Tax Credit Cash Fund, while 35% would go to the Wildlife Management Grant Program to be run by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, and 15% to the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Grant Program Fund.\n\nTEEOSA SUNSET: Sen. Steve Halloran of Hastings, along with 13 co-sponsors, brought a bill (LB81) that would sunset the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act, better known as TEEOSA.\n\nEnacted in 1990, TEEOSA calculates the difference between what schools need to educate every child from what resources are available in property taxes to determine how much state aid a district should receive.\n\nHalloran, who will be term-limited this year, said the sunset included in LB81 would end TEEOSA in 2027 without identifying a replacement, requiring the next Legislature to figure out a solution.\n\nTAX LAWSUITS: Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar introduced several proposed constitutional amendments granting individuals the right to sue political subdivisions for levying new taxes (LR7CA), increasing tax rates (LR8CA), extending expiring taxes (LR9CA), changing policies that result in a net tax revenue gain (LR10CA), or enter into financial obligations without pledged cash reserves (LR11CA) that have not been approved by voters at a November general election.\n\nSlama also introduced constitutional amendments that would require political subdivisions to receive voter approval to levy new taxes (LR12CA), increase tax rates (LR13CA), extend expiring taxes (LR14CA), and change policies that result in a new tax revenue gain (LR15CA), and enter into financial obligations without pledged cash reserves (LR16CA).\n\nDIFFERENT TAX METHOD: Omaha Sen. Mike McDonnell's proposed constitutional amendment (LR24CA) would allow the Legislature to create a separate method for taxing residential properties, such as limiting the growth of valuations.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska Legislature gavels in for first day of 2024 session\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7223 or awegley@journalstar.com.

Jim Pillen on Friday by voting to send the core of his property tax relief proposal to a more unfavorable committee than anticipated.\n\nThe Revenue Committee is usually the destination for bills dealing with taxation and property taxes. All introduced bills and policy resolutions must get a public hearing and must be sent to the \"appropriate committee,\" per the Legislature's internal rules.\n\nWhen it came to Legislative Bill 1, introduced by State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of Elkhorn on Pillen's behalf, the internally selected, 10-member Executive Board took a different approach. Five of the nine voting members determined the best destination for the 139-page proposal would be the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\nTheir reasoning: It touches various aspects of government overall, not just taxes.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWoodbury County Court Report for July 22, 2024 BNSF Railway wants to remove collapsed Big Sioux River train bridge North Sioux City crash kills one Jason's Frozen Treats open second dine-in ice cream parlor 4-year-old boy escaped from cage in Iowa home; deputies found him covered in feces on street Two dead following Sunday night two-vehicle accident in Sioux City's westside Now streaming and on DVD: 'The Richmond Way' gives us the whole 'Ted Lasso' story Sioux City's Lyons Park getting $1.22 million in upgrades Sioux City driver charged with vehicular homicide from weekend crash Wife of Dakota Dunes fatal stabbing suspect charged as an accessory State baseball: Scrapy dynamic duo sends Crusaders to state title game, down top seed Wahlert Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for July 23, 2024 82-year-old man gets 32-year prison sentence for child porn Financial situation for McCook Lake residents still murky a month after flood 2 sentenced to prison for selling fentanyl in Sioux City\n\n\"Logically, it could have been sent to 10 different committees,\" State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar, an Executive Board member, told the Nebraska Examiner. \"The key for me was that the overarching theme is the authority of government.\"\n\nPossibly less friendly committee\n\nDuring debate on a previous Pillen-led tax package this spring, the Government Committee chair, State Sen. Tom Brewer of north-central Nebraska, was the only committee member who voted for the bill. Seven other members opposed or otherwise did not vote for the bill.\n\nState Sens. Ray Aguilar of Grand Island and John Lowe of Kearney are members of both the Government Committee and the Executive Board, where they serve as chair and vice chair.\n\nThe committee shift is likely to be short-lived as Aguilar and Lowe both said they'd reverse their votes come Monday. Still, it sends a strong message to the first term governor, who already faces an uphill climb to get enough votes for the property tax relief ideas he's worked on all summer.\n\nIn addition to Aguilar and Lowe, State Sens. Merv Riepe of Ralston, Tony Vargas of Omaha and Slama agreed to the Government Committee pick. State Sens. John Arch of La Vista, Beau Ballard of Lincoln, Eliot Bostar of Lincoln and Mike Jacobson of North Platte voted against.\n\n'This is about taxes'\n\nArch, the Legislature's speaker, who sets the daily agenda, noted that there would likely be a committee amendment before LB 1, or any other major tax proposal this special session, makes it to the floor.\n\nHe encouraged his colleagues to consider which committee would be the most qualified to craft that compromise to deal with Nebraska's tax issue.\n\nLinehan joined Brewer on Friday in requesting that the Executive Board's vote be reconsidered.\n\n\"The subject matter of this bill -- pertaining to the assessment and collection of taxes -- is best heard in the Revenue Committee,\" Brewer and Linehan wrote in a joint letter.\n\nLinehan has the option to force a floor vote to send the bill to her committee if the Executive Board members do not reconsider. She said she is \"not the least concerned.\"\n\n\"Everybody in the whole state knows this is about taxes,\" Linehan told reporters, referring to LB 1.\n\n\"I don't think Nebraskans would be very happy when they find out that a handful of senators have decided that we should go home, enjoy the rest of our summer and not worry about the crisis of property taxes in the State of Nebraska.\"\n\nLowe, asked how he would vote Monday, said he has \"always honored the chairmen.\"\n\nSlama said even if an introducer has a preferred committee, she and the top-ranking board must \"look at the text of the bill and not the personalities involved.\"\n\nAnother bucks committee suggestion\n\nAnother bill had been suggested, based on its content, to be sent to the Education Committee but ultimately found a home in the Revenue Committee: LB 9, from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward.\n\nHughes' bill, the bipartisan product of work with four other lawmakers, is an alternative K-12 school funding model to reduce general fund property tax rates for districts over 10 years. It also addresses the main state aid funding formula for the state's 244 school districts.\n\nLawmakers voted 5-3 to send the bill to the Revenue Committee, rather than to the Education Committee.\n\nLB 9 is one of the first bills up for legislative hearings this Monday, scheduled for 9:30 a.m. That will also be the final day of bill introductions for the special session. As of Friday, 35 bills and six constitutional amendments had been introduced so far. The Legislature will not meet Saturday as initially scheduled.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Jim Pillen contends.\n\nNebraska Chamber of Commerce President Bryan Slone made the argument during the first day of public hearings on bills introduced during the special legislative session that started Thursday. He testified on behalf of the state, Omaha and Lincoln Chambers of Commerce.\n\nWhile Slone said he is a \"very unhappy property taxpayer personally,\" he cited figures from the national Tax Foundation showing property taxes account for a similar share of state and local taxes paid in Nebraska as in neighboring states and urged lawmakers to spend more time studying the problem before taking what he called risky action.\n\n\"We don't have a $2 billion problem,\" he said, referring to the amount of property taxes that Pillen has targeted for cutting. \"There isn't a need to reduce property taxes 40% to be competitive.\"\n\nBut Scott Peterson, a rancher and an attorney who lives near Kilgore, testified that there is a \"substantial difference\" between the property taxes he pays on land he owns in Nebraska and land he owns in South Dakota. He supported a proposal to ratchet down the maximum school property tax levy over the next decade.\n\n\"This is a path that makes sense,\" he said.\n\nThat plan, introduced by State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, drew the most interest of the seven bills heard Monday. The seven addressed property taxes, the focus of the special session, in a variety of ways. They did not include Pillen's proposal, which is scheduled for a hearing Tuesday.\n\nThe governor's plan would create a new property tax credit worth $2.03 billion in the first year, aimed at offsetting school property taxes but distributed based on property valuation rather than the amount of school taxes paid by property owners. It would pay for the credit by increasing or imposing sales taxes and sin taxes on a number of goods and services, bringing in about $900 million, while capping property tax revenues collected by cities and counties.\n\nThe plan would leave major issues to be addressed by future lawmakers, including how to fulfill Pillen's goal of having state dollars replace property taxes for school operating costs. Legislative Bill 1, introduced on his behalf by Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Omaha area, would state the Legislature's intent to revamp the state school aid formula before the 2026-27 school year.\n\nAmong the seven bills heard Monday were measures setting a higher income tax rate for the wealthiest Nebraskans, creating a special tax on luxury items, raising cigarette taxes and offering income tax credits to renters who would not get direct benefit from property tax reductions.\n\nHughes' LB 9, which she called the \"Lower the Levy Cap\" bill, could offer an alternative to Pillen's plan. She said it would provide Nebraskans with stable, sustainable property tax relief, while preserving local control of schools.\n\nThe measure would trigger additional state aid for schools and force reductions in the amount of property taxes schools would be allowed to collect. She said the approach was better than the bill Pillen is pushing.\n\n\"I don't feel we're going to fix our way out of this problem with a tax credit,\" she said. \"The maximum levy cap for schools is the ultimate hard cap.\"\n\nUnder her plan, the school levy lid would drop from the current $1.05 down to 65 cents next year, then drop another 10 cents every two years until it reaches 25 cents in 2033. The lower lids would trigger additional state aid for schools and reduce the disparities in tax levies from district to district. It also would make changes in the state school aid formula to direct more aid to agricultural-based districts.\n\nLB 9 drew support from agricultural groups, including the Nebraska Farm Bureau and Nebraska Farmers Union, and from some education representatives. Other education leaders, including groups representing school boards, school administrators and teachers, took neutral positions, saying they wanted to see models of how the bill would affect individual school districts.\n\nSpencer Head, speaking for the Omaha Public Schools, objected to two provisions of the bill. One would eliminate the averaging adjustment, a factor in the state school aid formula that helps larger districts with lower than average per-school spending. The other would steer aid too much in the direction of rural districts.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A legislative session has begun to introduce and discuss a relevant bill.\n\nA proposal that has emerged as a potential alternative to Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen's controversial property tax relief plan won cautious support from several key interest groups at a public hearing Monday, which marked Day 3 of the special legislative session Pillen called to take up property tax reform.\n\nDrafted by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and introduced by Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, the bill (LB9) would lower the maximum property tax rate local school districts could levy by 80 cents over the course of a decade -- a 76% cut to the primary driver of high property tax bills in Nebraska.\n\nThe proposal calls for the maximum levy amount per $100 of taxable valuation of property to drop from $1.05 now to 65 cents next year before gradually reducing to 25 cents by 2034.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the legislation leaves crucial questions over how to fund the remaining $440 million balance unanswered.\n\nThat's on purpose, Hughes told the committee Monday.\n\n\"I didn't want to kill the bill by putting in a revenue source,\" she said.\n\nInstead, she hopes Nebraska's single-house Legislature can come to a consensus on how to fund the balance of the plan -- a task that has proved difficult this year at the Capitol, where lawmakers in April sank Pillen's initial tax plan over its reliance on the elimination of numerous sales tax exemptions.\n\nThe governor has doubled down on his plan, proposing new legislation this month that relies on the same sales tax increases that have drawn steady opposition from various industry groups and lawmakers whose support he would need for his bill to become law.\n\nBut Hughes' plan -- which she drafted alongside Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, Myron Dorn of Adams and Lynn Walz of Fremont, all of whom are co-sponsors of the legislation -- has so far avoided the opposition that has plagued Pillen's plan.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, lawmakers who in April championed Pillen's proposal praised the concept offered by Hughes.\n\nSen. Lou Ann Linehan of Elkhorn, the Revenue Committee chairwoman who introduced Pillen's plan on the governor's behalf last week, called LB9 \"impressive.\" Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul, a Pillen appointee, told Hughes: \"Your plan is a good plan.\"\n\nAnd key groups that have signaled public opposition to the governor's plan -- including the Nebraska Farmers Union and Nebraska Farm Bureau -- testified as proponents of the Hughes' proposal or offered cautious support while testifying in a neutral capacity.\n\nBruce Rieker, the top lobbyist for the Farm Bureau who testified in support of LB9 on behalf of that group and eight other agricultural groups in the state, said the plan \"contains several components that address our state's overreliance on property taxes\" and praised its incremental approach.\n\n\"We want this to be right, even if it doesn't mean right now,\" Rieker told lawmakers. \"And we would rather see you put the state on a trajectory that makes this meaningful and sustainable, and that you do it in a thoughtful and deliberate way.\"\n\nAmong others who testified in support of LB9 at Monday's hearing were representatives from the Nebraska Rural Community Schools Association, Schools Taking Action for Nebraska Childrens' Education and several school districts across the state, including Centennial Public School, which serves about 500 students in Utica.\n\nJason Richters, a farmer and the Centennial Public School Board president, praised the bill's maintenance of local control of public schools, which has emerged as a chief concern hanging over Pillen's plan to cut property taxes by putting nearly all public school funding in the hands of the state.\n\n\"Nebraskans are passionate about maintaining local control of their schools and the education offered to their children,\" Richters said. \"I believe they're unwilling to jeopardize that for a few more dollars in tax relief.\"\n\nRepresentatives from the Nebraska State Education Association, the Nebraska Association of County Officials and the state Association of School Boards praised Hughes' plan but withheld full endorsements as they wait for further details to be ironed out.\n\n\"There's a lot here to support,\" said Colby Coash, a lobbyist for the school board group and the Nebraska Council of School Administrators.\n\nWhile groups from the public sector broadly voiced support of the plan, business groups lined up in opposition.\n\nBryan Slone, the president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, said the group's \"biggest issue\" with LB9 is that it fails to identify the scale of the problem lawmakers were recalled to Lincoln to fix.\n\n\"Which is: How big is our property tax problem?\" Slone said. \"Do we need to reduce property taxes by 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 percent to be competitive with other states? It would be nice to define that before we start raising the (sales and/or income) taxes.\"\n\nIncome, property and sales taxes make up the \"three-legged stool\" that defines state revenues, which have grown increasingly reliant on property taxes as lawmakers have passed corporate and individual income tax cuts in recent years.\n\nIn the fiscal year that ended June 30, the state's total net tax revenues included $3.6 billion in sales taxes, $4.2 million in income taxes and $5.1 billion in property taxes.\n\nIncome tax revenues are projected to drop by $1 billion by 2027 as a result of prior tax cuts, but Pillen has made \"transformational\" property tax cuts the top priority of his second year as Nebraska's governor.\n\n\"I'm not saying there isn't a property tax problem,\" Slone said Monday. \"But when we say we need to reduce property taxes by 40 or 50 percent to be competitive, that's just not true.\"\n\nThe Lincoln Independent Business Association and the conservative fiscal group The Platte Institute also opposed Hughes' plan Monday.\n\nAnd the otherwise warm reception LB9 received at Monday's hearing could sour when new revenue streams become part of the legislation.\n\nIn an exchange with Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Rieker, the Farm Bureau's lobbyist, acknowledged that the group would no longer support the plan if the bill included new sales taxes on agricultural inputs or equipment to fund property tax relief.\n\n\"That would be a career-ending move on my part,\" Rieker joked.\n\nThe exchange highlights the challenge lawmakers will face in trying to identify new revenue streams without angering influential industry groups and threatening the popularity of any property tax relief proposal.\n\nBut lawmakers will have numerous revenue-generating proposals to consider when they begin deliberations next week, including new ideas put forward Monday, which marked the last day senators could introduce legislation to be considered during the special legislative session.\n\nLawmakers have introduced 81 bills and 24 constitutional amendments to be considered this session, including 64 pieces of legislation put forward Monday. Among the latest batch of proposals:\n\nMARIJUANA LEGALIZATION: Two Omaha senators proposed legalizing and taxing marijuana for recreational use.\n\nSen. Justin Wayne proposed (LB52) setting a 25% excise tax on cultivators who sell or transfer unprocessed cannabis to manufacturers or stores, as well as a 25% sales tax to be paid by consumers.\n\nThe proceeds from Wayne's bill, after expenses to administer the Cannabis Control Act, would be directed into the Education Future Fund which provides an equal amount of funding for all public school students in Nebraska.\n\nSen. Terrell McKinney proposed (LB71) a 16% excise and sales tax on cannabis products in Nebraska.\n\nUnder McKinney's bill, 50% of the proceeds from the sales tax would be transferred to the property tax credit cash fund and 40% would go to the Education Future Fund used to support public schools. The remainder would be used for grants tied to business development, prisoner reentry, education and youth outreach.\n\nMANSION TAX: Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue sponsored a bill (LB36) implementing a 1.25% real estate transfer tax on all single-family homes valued at more than $800,000.\n\nLUXURY TAXES: Nebraskans would pay more in taxes on a slew of luxury items under a bill (LB54) from Wayne. Among the luxury items taxed at 2.25% included in the legislation are vehicles over $50,000; jewelry that costs more than $5,000; clothing that costs more than $1,000.\n\nMore expensive vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, and jewelry and clothing would also be subject to higher tax rates, under Wayne's plan.\n\nCAPITAL GAINS: Unrealized capital gains for individuals, corporations, or others would be taxed at 10% beginning in 2025, under a bill (LB51) from Wayne, with that amount declining to 8% in 2026 and 7% in 2027.\n\nEXCISE TAX ON AMMO: Wayne also introduced a bill (LB65) that would add a 5% excise tax on all purchases of ammunition in Nebraska.\n\nHalf of the revenue generated would go to the Property Tax Credit Cash Fund, while 35% would go to the Wildlife Management Grant Program to be run by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, and 15% to the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Grant Program Fund.\n\nTEEOSA SUNSET: Sen. Steve Halloran of Hastings, along with 13 co-sponsors, brought a bill (LB81) that would sunset the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act, better known as TEEOSA.\n\nEnacted in 1990, TEEOSA calculates the difference between what schools need to educate every child from what resources are available in property taxes to determine how much state aid a district should receive.\n\nHalloran, who will be term-limited this year, said the sunset included in LB81 would end TEEOSA in 2027 without identifying a replacement, requiring the next Legislature to figure out a solution.\n\nTAX LAWSUITS: Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar introduced several proposed constitutional amendments granting individuals the right to sue political subdivisions for levying new taxes (LR7CA), increasing tax rates (LR8CA), extending expiring taxes (LR9CA), changing policies that result in a net tax revenue gain (LR10CA), or enter into financial obligations without pledged cash reserves (LR11CA) that have not been approved by voters at a November general election.\n\nSlama also introduced constitutional amendments that would require political subdivisions to receive voter approval to levy new taxes (LR12CA), increase tax rates (LR13CA), extend expiring taxes (LR14CA), and change policies that result in a new tax revenue gain (LR15CA), and enter into financial obligations without pledged cash reserves (LR16CA).\n\nDIFFERENT TAX METHOD: Omaha Sen. Mike McDonnell's proposed constitutional amendment (LR24CA) would allow the Legislature to create a separate method for taxing residential properties, such as limiting the growth of valuations.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska Legislature gavels in for first day of 2024 session\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7223 or awegley@journalstar.com.

Pillen's property tax relief plan up to $139 million short", "body": "Gov. Jim Pillen officially unviles his property tax plan as a summer-long attempt to find a path to reduce local property taxes. July 18, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\n\nLINCOLN -- As introduced, Gov. Jim Pillen's core property tax relief proposal could fall short by $139 million in annual estimated revenue needed.\n\nPillen's main proposal, introduced through Legislative Bill 1 in the special session, includes placing a sales tax on more than 100 currently tax-exempt goods and services. It would also raise seven \"sin\" taxes, on candy and soft drinks, vapes, cigarettes, keno gambling, spirits, consumable hemp and games of skill.\n\nIn total, the new or increased taxes would raise an estimated $1.15 billion in the first full fiscal year on state tax rolls. If passed, Pillen's office is targeting an Oct. 1 effective date, which is not yet included in LB 1.\n\nThose values rely upon estimates provided to lawmakers last Wednesday, one day before State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan introduced LB 1 on Pillen's behalf.\n\nHowever, the tax rates as introduced varied from the ones provided to reporters and lawmakers in the days leading up to the session, which a spokesperson said was likely the result of bill drafting errors.\n\nFor example, four currently exempt goods and services were suggested to be taxed at higher rates than were ultimately included in the bill:\n\nThe statewide sales tax rate is 5.5 cents per dollar purchase, plus any municipal or county sales tax rates, which range from an additional 0.5 cents to 2 cents.\n\nAccording to an analysis from the Nebraska Examiner, the Pillen-led proposal would fall short of his revenue goal by $139 million, largely because the projected machinery and equipment revenue was half of what was projected earlier.\n\nThat would complicate the governor's main tax relief pursuit: the state taking on 80% of local K-12 funding paid for through property taxes.\n\nA spokesperson for Pillen said the intention is to tax machinery and equipment at 4 cents and the change \"was just a drafter's situation.\" No amendments have yet been introduced to fix that drafting error. She said she was unaware of what happened with carpentry services and electricians' services, which make up a much smaller portion of the revenue that could be lost.\n\nLB 1 as introduced would also more broadly end some sales tax exemptions that multiple lawmakers who had been working with Pillen said were off the table:\n\nLB 1 is first up in a Revenue Committee hearing at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. Two lawmakers on the Executive Board switched their votes Monday to send the bill there instead of the Government Committee.\n\nThe Revenue Committee, which Linehan chairs, is usually the designation for bills addressing taxation. Members could be more open to Pillen's proposal than those on the Government Committee, where only one of eight members supported a previous Pillen-backed proposal in the spring. In contrast, seven of eight Revenue Committee members supported the previous bill.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Pillen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Pillen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_Newsroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "States Newsroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hemp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_exemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax exemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Ann_Linehan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lou Ann Linehan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/nebraska_examiner_articles_344/97f467dba04c13b6201473a39c6c2e91", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774020", "eventUri": "eng-9774020", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-01", "textStart": 814, "textEnd": 820}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-07-", "textStart": 129, "textEnd": 136}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

In total, the session produced 81 bills, plus 24 separate constitutional amendments, more than half of which just dropped on Monday.\n\nThat smashes the previous record of 54 bills introduced in a special session in 1935, back when the Legislature was still was bicameral, meaning it had a House and a Senate, and not unicameral.\n\nGov. Jim Pillen called lawmakers back to the Capitol to work to cut Nebraska's property taxes by 50% by the end of this year. His proclamation largely limits subjects of the session to tax-related issues.\n\nBut lawmakers' proposals for achieving property tax cuts run the gamut, from adjusting the state's homestead exemptions policy to regulating fantasy sports competitions.\n\nThe main portion of Pillen's plan, Legislative Bill 1, hit a snag on Friday when the Legislature's Referencing Committee voted to send the bill to the Government, Military and Veteran Affairs Committee, rather than the expected Revenue Committee. The switch would have removed some control from the bill's introducer, State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Omaha area, to oversee changes to the bill. Linehan said she suspected the move was a covert attempt at killing the bill through sending it to a less friendly committee.\n\nThat issue resolved Monday when the Referencing Committee met again and voted to move LB 1 to the Revenue Committee. The decision was made after the committee received a request signed by both the revenue and government chairs, and was agreed to with little debate.\n\nLawmakers' ideas include tobacco, marijuana and ammunition\n\nHere are some of the 64 new proposals introduced Monday:\n\nTobacco. Two bills would increase taxes Nebraskans pay for tobacco products. LB 41, introduced by Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, would increase the tax on electronic nicotine devices from 10% to 40%, and LB 60 from Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha would establish a 20% tax on cigars, cheroots and stogies.\n\nPillen has proposed increasing the state's cigarette tax from 64 cents to $1.64 cents per pack as a way to increase revenues to offset property tax relief. Separately, Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha suggested raising the tax to $2.14 per pack.\n\nCannabis. Two bills dropped Monday would legalize marijuana and forgive certain past convictions related to the drug, LB 52 from Wayne and LB 71 from Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha. Marijuana legalization has often been proposed as a way to increase state revenues, but such ideas have gotten little traction in the Legislature.\n\nElected official salaries. Certain elected members of Nebraska's political subdivisions, working full time, could not earn more than $36,000 per year, under LB 56. Introduced by Wayne, the bill limits the salaries of elected officials working in the legislative bodies of political subdivisions to no more than three times the annual salary of members of the Legislature. Lawmakers currently earn $12,000 a year. The bill would also limit part-time elected officials to no more than $24,000 per year.\n\nCurrently, Omaha City Council members earn $42,923 per year.\n\nFunding formula. Nebraska's current school funding formula, known as the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act or TEEOSA, would be dissolved on July 1, 2027, under LB 81 introduced by Sen. Steve Halloran of Hastings. Lawmakers have attempted for years to propose alternate funding strategies in an effort to move Nebraska away from TEEOSA since its adoption in 1990, but none have proven successful.\n\nHalloran's bill would set a hard deadline to achieve the goal.\n\nLawsuits over taxes. Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar introduced a collection of 10 constitutional amendments intended to prevent political subdivisions increasing the tax burden on its constituents without voter approval.\n\nPolitical subdivisions would be banned from increasing tax rates, levying new taxes, extending an expiring tax, changing tax policy in a way that results in net increases in tax revenue, or creating certain debts or financial obligations without having the necessary cash reserved. Slama's proposal would authorize residents to sue their political subdivisions if they take any of those actions without earning voter approval first.\n\nSlama also introduced a similar collection of constitutional amendments to require political subdivisions to save at least 3% of their fiscal year spending in reserve for declared emergencies, and limit annual spending increases for the state and political subdivisions to the inflation rate plus the change in population.\n\nAmmunition sales. A 5% excise tax would be imposed on ammunition sales under LB 65, which Wayne introduced. Half of the revenue from the tax would go to the state's property tax credit cash fund, and the other half would be split between two new grant programs the bill would establish -- one to support wildlife management, and the other to aid victims of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nResidential property. Valuation of residential property could not increase by more than 5% per year under LB 72, introduced by Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha. An accompanying constitutional amendment would classify residential real property as a distinct taxation class, allowing it to be taxed differently than other types of housing. Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth made a similar proposal this session for owner-occupied housing.\n\nEarlier in the session, lawmakers had proposed measures dealing with the governor's plane, reducing the prison population, legalizing online sports gaming and other measures to raise state revenues, reduce spending or limit property taxes.\n\nGovernment-politics Nebraska Gov.

Jim Pillen property tax plan", "body": "LINCOLN -- One former state senator contended Tuesday that Gov. Jim Pillen's plan to cut property taxes 50% by expanding sales and other taxes has support across Nebraska.\n\n\"The vast majority of Nebraskans are behind him in the struggle,\" said Dan Hughes, who farms near Venango. \"The property tax crisis in Nebraska needs to be fixed.\"\n\nBut opponents accounted for the vast majority of people who turned up to testify at a public hearing on Legislative Bill 1, which encompasses the key tax-related pieces of the governor's plan.\n\nNine hours into the hearing during the special session on property taxes, the Revenue Committee had heard from five times as many critics as supporters and many more opponents were waiting for their turns to speak. Combined, they called for changes in almost every provision of the sweeping proposal.\n\nLocal government officials issue warnings about the plan\n\nThe first portion of LB 1 would cap property tax revenues collected by cities and counties, bringing objections from a number of city and county officials.\n\nStephen Curtis, the City of Omaha's finance director, was among those who criticized the caps. He said they could hamstring Omaha's ability to cope with economic ups and downs or to deal with rising costs of city services. Although sales taxes may be enough to help out some years, they could fall short in others, he said.\n\nIn addition, he said lower property tax levies would hurt development projects funded through tax-increment financing, warning that the bill \"would jeopardize Omaha's positive momentum.\"\n\nDouglas County Attorney Don Klein said the looser caps proposed for hiring public safety staff should be broadened to include prosecutors and public defenders, while Gretna Mayor Mike Evans called for those caps to cover vehicles, computers and other equipment needed by public safety employees.\n\nSchool officials criticized the proposal to create a new property tax credit, worth $2.03 billion in the first year. The credit would be aimed at offsetting school property taxes while future lawmakers figure out how to fulfill Pillen's ultimate goal of eliminating property taxes for school operating costs.\n\nSpencer Head, president of the Omaha Public Schools Board, argued for keeping property taxes as a key source of school funding. He said property taxes offer stable funding for schools, while history has shown that state school aid is less reliable. He said state lawmakers have cut aid during economic downturns.\n\nEducation OPS board to vote on opposition to Pillen's tax plan in special Friday meeting Lauren Wagner\n\nLiz Standish, associate superintendent for Lincoln Public Schools, said that eliminating school property taxes would jeopardize local control because it would not allow school boards to not control local budgets. She also objected to the proposal to distribute the new property tax credit to taxpayers based on the valuation of their property, rather than school property taxes paid.\n\nTestifiers say Pillen plan could hurt adoptions, farmers, more\n\nThe governor's proposal to increase or impose sales taxes and sin taxes on more than 100 goods and services brought the most opponents, including farm groups, business groups and various affected businesses and professions. Under the bill, money raised from the tax changes would be used to fund the new property tax credit.\n\nMark McHargue, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau, spoke for a coalition of agriculture groups, against putting a 2 cent sales tax on agricultural machinery and equipment. A later speaker said the proposal would drive people to other states to buy combines and other equipment, which can cost up to $1 million.\n\nOthers objected to higher taxes on liquor, home repair and maintenance, vehicle repair, veterinary care for pets, storage and moving services, pop, candy, advertising, manufacturing machinery and equipment, vaping, consumable hemp products, massage therapy, keno, games of skill, taxi services and legal services.\n\nAmong them, John Sennett, a Broken Bow attorney, said the proposed tax would have consequences for his clients. He said he doesn't want to have to tell a young couple that the cost of adopting a child just increased because of the new taxes.\n\nMelanie Kirk, executive director for the Nebraska Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, offered a hypothetical scenario showing how the sales tax expansion could affect people.\n\nThe story began with a woman, Laura, whose husband kicked down her door and disabled her car. Repair of both would now be subject to tax. Laura took an Uber -- newly taxed -- while her car was being fixed. Meanwhile, someone broke into her home and hurt her dog. Veterinary care for the dog would be taxed.\n\nThe next developments in the story had Laura paying tax for a rental agent to find a secure place to live, storage services before she could move in, a moving company, a new prepaid phone plan and finally collection services after her husband drained their bank account.\n\nPillen's plan had some fans as well. Deb Kelly of O'Neill said she knew the measure would require tradeoffs but she and her family would be willing to pay their fair share of new taxes to bring down property taxes.\n\n\"I'm just asking people to focus on what's good for the whole playground,\" she said.\n\nAnother proponent, Mark Beiting of Gretna, said his wife wants to keep their sons and grandchildren nearby but two sons are considering moving to Iowa because of high Nebraska property taxes.\n\n\"My wife begins to sob every time she hears this discussion,\" he said. \"You've got to take action.\"\n\nPhotos: Nebraska

Jim Pillen contends.\n\nNebraska Chamber of Commerce President Bryan Slone made the argument during the first day of public hearings on bills introduced during the special legislative session that started Thursday. He testified on behalf of the state, Omaha and Lincoln Chambers of Commerce.\n\nWhile Slone said he is a \"very unhappy property taxpayer personally,\" he cited figures from the national Tax Foundation showing property taxes account for a similar share of state and local taxes paid in Nebraska as in neighboring states and urged lawmakers to spend more time studying the problem before taking what he called risky action.\n\n\"We don't have a $2 billion problem,\" he said, referring to the amount of property taxes that Pillen has targeted for cutting. \"There isn't a need to reduce property taxes 40% to be competitive.\"\n\nBut Scott Peterson, a rancher and attorney who lives near Kilgore, testified that there is a \"substantial difference\" between the property taxes he pays on land he owns in Nebraska and land he owns in South Dakota. He supported a proposal to ratchet down the maximum school property tax levy over the next decade.\n\n\"This is a path that makes sense,\" he said.\n\nThat plan, introduced by State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, drew the most interest of the seven bills heard Monday. The seven addressed property taxes, the focus of the special session, in a variety of ways. They did not include Pillen's proposal, which is scheduled for a hearing Tuesday.\n\nThe governor's plan would create a new property tax credit worth $2.03 billion in the first year, aimed at offsetting school property taxes but distributed based on property valuation rather than the amount of school taxes paid by property owners. It would pay for the credit by increasing or imposing sales taxes and sin taxes on a number of goods and services, bringing in about $900 million, while capping property tax revenues collected by cities and counties.\n\nThe plan would leave major issues to be addressed by future lawmakers, including how to fulfill Pillen's goal of having state dollars replace property taxes for school operating costs. Legislative Bill 1, introduced on his behalf by Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Omaha area, would state the Legislature's intent to revamp the state school aid formula before the 2026-27 school year.\n\nAmong the seven bills heard Monday were measures setting a higher income tax rate for the wealthiest Nebraskans, creating a special tax on luxury items, raising cigarette taxes and offering income tax credits to renters who would not get direct benefit from property tax reductions.\n\nHughes' LB 9, which she called the \"Lower the Levy Cap\" bill, could offer an alternative to Pillen's plan. She said it would provide Nebraskans with stable, sustainable property tax relief, while preserving local control of schools.\n\nThe measure would trigger additional state aid for schools and force reductions in the amount of property taxes schools would be allowed to collect. She said the approach was better than the bill Pillen is pushing.\n\n\"I don't feel we're going to fix our way out of this problem with a tax credit,\" she said. \"The maximum levy cap for schools is the ultimate hard cap.\"\n\nUnder her plan, the school levy lid would drop from the current $1.05 down to 65 cents next year, then drop another 10 cents every two years until it reaches 25 cents in 2033. The lower lids would trigger additional state aid for schools and reduce the disparities in tax levies from district to district. It also would make changes in the state school aid formula to direct more aid to agricultural-based districts.\n\nLB 9 drew support from agricultural groups, including the Nebraska Farm Bureau and Nebraska Farmers Union, and from some education representatives. Other education leaders, including groups representing school boards, school administrators and teachers, took neutral positions, saying they wanted to see models of how the bill would affect individual school districts.\n\nSpencer Head, speaking for the Omaha Public Schools, objected to two provisions of the bill. One would eliminate the averaging adjustment, a factor in the state school aid formula that helps larger districts with lower than average per-school spending. The other would steer aid too much in the direction of rural districts.\n\nGovernment-politics Nebraska Gov.

Jim Pillen's controversial property tax relief plan won cautious support from several key interest groups at a public hearing Monday, which marked Day 3 of the special legislative session Pillen called to take up property tax reform.\n\nDrafted by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and introduced by Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, the bill (LB9) would lower the maximum property tax rate local school districts could levy by 80 cents over the course of a decade -- a 76% cut to the primary driver of high property tax bills in Nebraska.\n\nThe proposal calls for the maximum levy amount per $100 of taxable valuation of property to drop from $1.05 now to 65 cents next year before gradually reducing to 25 cents by 2034.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Jim Pillen defends tax plan, personal gain\n\nSuch a move would require the state to increase its aid to public schools by about $1 billion next year and another $253 million every two years after that, Hughes told the Legislature's Revenue Committee at Monday's hearing.\n\nThe bill, like Pillen's preferred plan, calls for the front-loading of existing property tax credits to cover about $560 million of the initial $1 billion necessary to fund the property tax cuts. But the legislation leaves crucial questions over how to fund the remaining $440 million balance unanswered.\n\nThat's on purpose, Hughes told the committee Monday.\n\n\"I didn't want to kill the bill by putting in a revenue source,\" she said.\n\nInstead, she hopes Nebraska's single-house Legislature can come to a consensus on how to fund the balance of the plan -- a task that has proved difficult this year at the Capitol, where lawmakers in April sank Pillen's initial tax plan over its reliance on the elimination of numerous sales tax exemptions.\n\nThe governor has doubled down on his plan, proposing new legislation this month that relies on the same sales tax increases that have drawn steady opposition from various industry groups and lawmakers whose support he would need for his bill to become law.\n\nBut Hughes' plan -- which she drafted alongside Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, Myron Dorn of Adams and Lynn Walz of Fremont, all of whom are co-sponsors of the legislation -- has so far avoided the opposition that has plagued Pillen's plan.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, lawmakers who in April championed Pillen's proposal praised the concept offered by Hughes.\n\nSen. Lou Ann Linehan of Elkhorn, the Revenue Committee chairwoman who introduced Pillen's plan on the governor's behalf last week, called LB9 \"impressive.\" Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul, a Pillen appointee, told Hughes: \"Your plan is a good plan.\"\n\nAnd key groups that have signaled public opposition to the governor's plan -- including the Nebraska Farmers Union and Nebraska Farm Bureau -- testified as proponents of the Hughes' proposal or offered cautious support while testifying in a neutral capacity.\n\nBruce Rieker, the top lobbyist for the Farm Bureau who testified in support of LB9 on behalf of that group and eight other agricultural groups in the state, said the plan \"contains several components that address our state's overreliance on property taxes\" and praised its incremental approach.\n\n\"We want this to be right, even if it doesn't mean right now,\" Rieker told lawmakers. \"And we would rather see you put the state on a trajectory that makes this meaningful and sustainable, and that you do it in a thoughtful and deliberate way.\"\n\nAmong others who testified in support of LB9 at Monday's hearing were representatives from the Nebraska Rural Community Schools Association, Schools Taking Action for Nebraska Childrens' Education and several school districts across the state, including Centennial Public School, which serves about 500 students in Utica.\n\nJason Richters, a farmer and the Centennial Public School Board president, praised the bill's maintenance of local control of public schools, which has emerged as a chief concern hanging over Pillen's plan to cut property taxes by putting nearly all public school funding in the hands of the state.\n\n\"Nebraskans are passionate about maintaining local control of their schools and the education offered to their children,\" Richters said. \"I believe they're unwilling to jeopardize that for a few more dollars in tax relief.\"\n\nRepresentatives from the Nebraska State Education Association, the Nebraska Association of County Officials and the state Association of School Boards praised Hughes' plan but withheld full endorsements as they wait for further details to be ironed out.\n\n\"There's a lot here to support,\" said Colby Coash, a lobbyist for the school board group and the Nebraska Council of School Administrators.\n\nWhile groups from the public sector broadly voiced support of the plan, business groups lined up in opposition.\n\nBryan Slone, the president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, said the group's \"biggest issue\" with LB9 is that it fails to identify the scale of the problem lawmakers were recalled to Lincoln to fix.\n\n\"Which is: How big is our property tax problem?\" Slone said. \"Do we need to reduce property taxes by 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 percent to be competitive with other states? It would be nice to define that before we start raising the (sales and/or income) taxes.\"\n\nIncome, property and sales taxes make up the \"three-legged stool\" that defines state revenues, which have grown increasingly reliant on property taxes as lawmakers have passed corporate and individual income tax cuts in recent years.\n\nIn the fiscal year that ended June 30, the state's total net tax revenues included $3.6 billion in sales taxes, $4.2 million in income taxes and $5.1 billion in property taxes.\n\nIncome tax revenues are projected to drop by $1 billion by 2027 as a result of prior tax cuts, but Pillen has made \"transformational\" property tax cuts the top priority of his second year as Nebraska's governor.\n\n\"I'm not saying there isn't a property tax problem,\" Slone said Monday. \"But when we say we need to reduce property taxes by 40 or 50 percent to be competitive, that's just not true.\"\n\nThe Lincoln Independent Business Association and the conservative fiscal group The Platte Institute also opposed Hughes' plan Monday.\n\nAnd the otherwise warm reception LB9 received at Monday's hearing could sour when new revenue streams become part of the legislation.\n\nIn an exchange with Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Rieker, the Farm Bureau's lobbyist, acknowledged that the group would no longer support the plan if the bill included new sales taxes on agricultural inputs or equipment to fund property tax relief.\n\n\"That would be a career-ending move on my part,\" Rieker joked.\n\nThe exchange highlights the challenge lawmakers will face in trying to identify new revenue streams without angering influential industry groups and threatening the popularity of any property tax relief proposal.\n\nBut lawmakers will have numerous revenue-generating proposals to consider when they begin deliberations next week, including new ideas put forward Monday, which marked the last day senators could introduce legislation to be considered during the special legislative session.\n\nLawmakers have introduced 81 bills and 24 constitutional amendments to be considered this session, including 64 pieces of legislation put forward Monday. Among the latest batch of proposals:\n\nMARIJUANA LEGALIZATION: Two Omaha senators proposed legalizing and taxing marijuana for recreational use.\n\nSen. Justin Wayne proposed (LB52) setting a 25% excise tax on cultivators who sell or transfer unprocessed cannabis to manufacturers or stores, as well as a 25% sales tax to be paid by consumers.\n\nThe proceeds from Wayne's bill, after expenses to administer the Cannabis Control Act, would be directed into the Education Future Fund which provides an equal amount of funding for all public school students in Nebraska.\n\nSen. Terrell McKinney proposed (LB71) a 16% excise and sales tax on cannabis products in Nebraska.\n\nUnder McKinney's bill, 50% of the proceeds from the sales tax would be transferred to the property tax credit cash fund and 40% would go to the Education Future Fund used to support public schools. The remainder would be used for grants tied to business development, prisoner reentry, education and youth outreach.\n\nMANSION TAX: Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue sponsored a bill (LB36) implementing a 1.25% real estate transfer tax on all single-family homes valued at more than $800,000.\n\nLUXURY TAXES: Nebraskans would pay more in taxes on a slew of luxury items under a bill (LB54) from Wayne. Among the luxury items taxed at 2.25% included in the legislation are vehicles over $50,000; jewelry that costs more than $5,000; clothing that costs more than $1,000.\n\nMore expensive vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, and jewelry and clothing would also be subject to higher tax rates, under Wayne's plan.\n\nCAPITAL GAINS: Unrealized capital gains for individuals, corporations, or others would be taxed at 10% beginning in 2025, under a bill (LB51) from Wayne, with that amount declining to 8% in 2026 and 7% in 2027.\n\nEXCISE TAX ON AMMO: Wayne also introduced a bill (LB65) that would add a 5% excise tax on all purchases of ammunition in Nebraska.\n\nHalf of the revenue generated would go to the Property Tax Credit Cash Fund, while 35% would go to the Wildlife Management Grant Program to be run by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, and 15% to the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Grant Program Fund.\n\nTEEOSA SUNSET: Sen. Steve Halloran of Hastings, along with 13 co-sponsors, brought a bill (LB81) that would sunset the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act, better known as TEEOSA.\n\nEnacted in 1990, TEEOSA calculates the difference between what schools need to educate every child from what resources are available in property taxes to determine how much state aid a district should receive.\n\nHalloran, who will be term-limited this year, said the sunset included in LB81 would end TEEOSA in 2027 without identifying a replacement, requiring the next Legislature to figure out a solution.\n\nTAX LAWSUITS: Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar introduced several proposed constitutional amendments granting individuals the right to sue political subdivisions for levying new taxes (LR7CA), increasing tax rates (LR8CA), extending expiring taxes (LR9CA), changing policies that result in a net tax revenue gain (LR10CA), or enter into financial obligations without pledged cash reserves (LR11CA) that have not been approved by voters at a November general election.\n\nSlama also introduced constitutional amendments that would require political subdivisions to receive voter approval to levy new taxes (LR12CA), increase tax rates (LR13CA), extend expiring taxes (LR14CA), and change policies that result in a new tax revenue gain (LR15CA), and enter into financial obligations without pledged cash reserves (LR16CA).\n\nDIFFERENT TAX METHOD: Omaha Sen. Mike McDonnell's proposed constitutional amendment (LR24CA) would allow the Legislature to create a separate method for taxing residential properties, such as limiting the growth of valuations.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska Legislature gavels in for first day of 2024 session\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7223 or awegley@journalstar.com.

Although we were scheduled to meet Thursday, Friday, and Saturday for bill introduction, the volume of bills getting processed was such that the Speaker decided to not have us meet on Saturday so that bill drafters could get caught up.\n\nThe last day for bill introduction will be on Monday. It is anticipated that as many as 100 bills will be introduced. This is not what any of us expected, and this volume of bills will certainly extend the length of the special session.\n\nThe first three bills (LB 1, LB 2, and LB 3) were introduced on behalf of the governor. The first bill deals with spending caps and sales tax changes. It was intended to be sent to the Revenue Committee, but five members of the Executive Committee (which serves as the reference committee) voted to send it to the Government, Military, and Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\nI joined Speaker Arch and two other members in voting against this move. All of the Revenue Committee members served on the governor's working group and are in the best position to lead the hearings on this bill, even though it deals with several issues.\n\nClearly, this was an effort to send a message to the governor and move the bill to a potentially less favorable committee. However, Sen. Tom Brewer, who chairs the Government Committee worked with Sen. Linehan (Revenue Committee chair) to immediately send a letter to the Referencing Committee to re-reference the bill to the Revenue Committee.\n\nThe question of re-referencing will be taken up Monday. I expect the bill to be successfully re-referenced.\n\nLB 2 and LB 3 are appropriation bills referenced to the Appropriations Committee.\n\nLB 1 is a 139-page bill that contains far more changes than the working group agreed to during our last two meetings. With this in mind, do not read too much into the individual components of the bill. These will change significantly before the bill gets voted out of committee. It will change even more before the bill gets the support to advance on the floor.\n\nI am not certain why the last changes from the working group were not made to the bill prior to introduction, but it will certainly evolve.\n\nDuring our last working group meeting, we agreed that no ag and business inputs would be subject to sales taxes. It is also important to note that I am opposed to the advertising tax (primarily due to legal issues), think the amount of the increase in the spirits excise tax is too high, and am concerned about taxing legal and accounting services.\n\nI also want to mention that Sen. John Cavanaugh introduced LB 17, which would terminate the Perkins County Canal project. This bill will be referred to the Natural Resources Committee on which I currently serve. I would be surprised if there's any appetite to advance it.\n\nIt is unclear at this point how long the session will last and how it will end. But I do know that there are several in the body who do not want the session to be successful.\n\nSo far, we have had a motion to adjourn Sine Die on Day 2 (with only four votes in support), we had the move to reference LB 1 to a committee other than the Revenue Committee, and we will have an unprecedented number of bills introduced for a special session.\n\nLike in any session, all bills will be referred to the committee of jurisdiction for a hearing. Because of this, the entire week will likely be devoted to committee hearings. I would expect most committee chairs to not allow any bills that do not pertain to the subject matter to be voted out of committee.\n\nHowever, any bill that gets to the floor would be subject to scheduling by the Speaker. He could choose not to schedule bills that get out of committee that do not fit the call.\n\nNo matter what takes place in this special session, the subject of property taxes will continue into the 2025 legislative session. I agreed to serve in the Legislature with one driving goal: To lower property taxes. I intend to accomplish this goal and protect agriculture in the process!\n\nI look forward to continuing to hear from you regarding issues that are important to you. It is a privilege to serve as your state senator, and I will continue to give my full effort to make a positive difference for the district and the state.

Jim Pillen's plan to cut property taxes 50% by expanding sales and other taxes has support across Nebraska.\n\n\"The vast majority of Nebraskans are behind him in the struggle,\" said Dan Hughes, who farms near Venango. \"The property tax crisis in Nebraska needs to be fixed.\"\n\nBut opponents accounted for the vast majority of people who turned up to testify at a public hearing on Legislative Bill 1, which encompasses the key tax-related pieces of the governor's plan.\n\nNine hours into the hearing during the special session on property taxes, the Revenue Committee had heard from five times as many critics as supporters and many more opponents were waiting for their turns to speak.Combined, they called for changes in almost every provision of the sweeping proposal.\n\nThe first portion of LB 1 would cap property tax revenues collected by cities and counties, bringing objections from a number of city and county officials.\n\nStephen Curtis, the City of Omaha's finance director, was among those who criticized the caps. He said they could hamstring Omaha's ability to cope with economic ups and downs or to deal with rising costs of city services. Although sales taxes may be enough to help out some years, they could fall short in others, he said.\n\nIn addition, he said lower property tax levies would hurt development projects funded through tax-increment financing, warning that the bill \"would jeopardize Omaha's positive momentum.\"\n\nDouglas County Attorney Don Klein said the looser caps proposed for hiring public safety staff should be broadened to include prosecutors and public defenders, while Gretna Mayor Mike Evans called for those caps to cover vehicles, computers and other equipment needed by public safety employees.\n\nSchool officials criticized the proposal to create a new property tax credit, worth $2.03 billion in the first year. The credit would be aimed at offsetting school property taxes while future lawmakers figure out how to fulfill Pillen's ultimate goal of eliminating property taxes for school operating costs.\n\nSpencer Head, president of the Omaha Public Schools Board, argued for keeping property taxes as a key source of school funding. He said property taxes offer stable funding for schools, while history has shown that state school aid is less reliable. He said state lawmakers have cut aid during economic downturns.\n\nLiz Standish, associate superintendent for Lincoln Public Schools, said that eliminating school property taxes would jeopardize local control because it would not allow school boards to not control local budgets. She also objected to the proposal to distribute the new property tax credit to taxpayers based on the valuation of their property, rather than school property taxes paid.\n\nTestifiers say Pillen plan could hurt adoptions, farmers, more\n\nThe governor's proposal to increase or impose sales taxes and sin taxes on more than 100 goods and services brought the most opponents, including farm groups, business groups and various affected businesses and professions. Under the bill, money raised from the tax changes would be used to fund the new property tax credit.\n\nMark McHargue, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau, spoke for a coalition of agriculture groups, against putting a 2 cent sales tax on agricultural machinery and equipment. A later speaker said the proposal would drive people to other states to buy combines and other equipment, which can cost up to $1 million.\n\nOthers objected to higher taxes on liquor, home repair and maintenance, vehicle repair, veterinary care for pets, storage and moving services, pop, candy, advertising, manufacturing machinery and equipment, vaping, consumable hemp products, massage therapy, keno, games of skill, taxi services and legal services.\n\nAmong them, John Sennett, a Broken Bow attorney, said the proposed tax would have consequences for his clients. He said he doesn't want to have to tell a young couple that the cost of adopting a child just increased because of the new taxes.\n\nMelanie Kirk, executive director for the Nebraska Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, offered a hypothetical scenario showing how the sales tax expansion could affect people.\n\nThe story began with a woman, Laura, whose husband kicked down her door and disabled her car. Repair of both would now be subject to tax. Laura took an Uber -- newly taxed -- while her car was being fixed. Meanwhile, someone broke into her home and hurt her dog. Veterinary care for the dog would be taxed.\n\nThe next developments in the story had Laura paying tax for a rental agent to find a secure place to live, storage services before she could move in, a moving company, a new prepaid phone plan and finally collection services after her husband drained their bank account.\n\nPillen's plan had some fans as well. Deb Kelly of O'Neill said she knew the measure would require tradeoffs but she and her family would be willing to pay their fair share of new taxes to bring down property taxes.\n\n\"I'm just asking people to focus on what's good for the whole playground,\" she said.\n\nAnother proponent, Mark Beiting of Gretna, said his wife wants to keep their sons and grandchildren nearby but two sons are considering moving to Iowa because of high Nebraska property taxes.\n\n\"My wife begins to sob every time she hears this discussion,\" he said. \"You've got to take action.\"\n\nmartha.stoddard@owh.com, 402670-2402, twitter.com/stoddardOWH", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jim Pillen proposes to limit how much schools can tax property owners, while increasing the amount of state aid to schools in his property tax reform package.\n\nThe Legislature's Revenue Committee heard testimony July 29 on a more gradual approach to reduce the maximum school district property tax levy over the next decade, while directing more state aid to public schools.\n\nLB 9, introduced by Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, would, among other changes, decrease the maximum school district levy from the current $1.05 per $100 of taxable valuation to 65 cents for fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27.\n\nThe levy would continue to decrease in 10-cent increments every two years until reaching 25 cents beginning with FY 2033-34.\n\nWith the initial levy reduction, Hughes said, the state's school funding formula would send an additional $1 billion in equalization aid -- state aid intended to cover the difference between a district's needs and its local resources, such as property taxes -- to Nebraska school districts each year.\n\nTo fund the proposal, Hughes said, LB 9 would repurpose approximately $560 million currently dedicated to the refundable income tax credit against school district property taxes paid that was created under the Nebraska Property Tax Incentive Act in 2020.\n\nShe said lawmakers would have to identify additional funds to cover the remaining cost and approximately $250 million for each further 10-cent reduction.\n\nHughes said the proposal is an \"alternative\" to Pillen's property tax reform plan contained, in part, in LB 1, sponsored by Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of Elkhorn.\n\nAs introduced, LB 1 also would repurpose the refundable income tax credit program to fund additional school aid. The governor's plan, however, states legislative intent to replace school general fund levies by school fiscal year 2026-27.\n\nIn addition to a more gradual reduction in the maximum levy, Hughes said, her proposal also would provide a \"safety net\" allowing a school district, with a majority vote of the school board, to levy property taxes to make up for any shortfall in equalization aid from the state.\n\nHughes said other changes in LB 9 would reduce the current spread between high- and low-levy districts and ensure that each district is funded at least in part by local property taxes.\n\nJason Richters, Centennial Public School Board president, testified in support of the bill. He said the gradual levy cap reduction would make it easier for administrators and school boards to set their budgets.\n\nLB 9 also would maintain local control by ensuring that school districts do not rely only on state funding for their operations, Richters said.\n\n\"Local patrons should have some skin in the game to ensure local ownership and pride in their schools' operation and success,\" he said.\n\nBruce Rieker testified in support of LB 9 on behalf of the Nebraska Farm Bureau and eight other agricultural organizations. He said the proposal is a \"thoughtful and deliberate\" approach to reducing the state's over-reliance on property taxes to fund public schools.\n\n\"We want this to be right even if it doesn't mean right now,\" Rieker said.\n\nAlso in support was Connie Knoche of OpenSky Policy Institute. In the upcoming school year, she said, only 64 of the state's 244 school districts will receive equalization aid. If the changes in LB 9 had been in place, Knoche said, 233 districts would have been equalized.\n\nBryan Slone testified in opposition to the bill on behalf of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce. He said lawmakers should consider ways to control rapid increases in property valuations before dedicating additional state revenue to property tax relief.\n\nAlso in opposition was Spencer Head of Omaha Public Schools. LB 9 would repeal the school funding formula's averaging adjustment, he said, which provides additional aid to certain school districts with 900 or more students. The adjustment provides \"essential aid\" for the state's largest districts and contributed approximately $6.7 million to the OPS budget this year, Head said.\n\nThe committee took no immediate action on the bill.", "source": {"uri": "northplattebulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Platte Bulletin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "unicameral_update@northplattebulletin.com", "name": "Unicameral Update", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Pillen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jim Pillen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jana_Hughes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jana Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seward_County,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seward County, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seward County, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Ann_Linehan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lou Ann Linehan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Omaha_Chamber_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Public_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omaha Public Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chamber of commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/High_School_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/High School Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://northplattebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Spec-session-Hughes-cr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774020", "eventUri": "eng-9774020", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 217, "textEnd": 224}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Mike McDonnell of Omaha, would exempt qualified Nebraska homeowners from paying any property taxes after 40 years of ownership in the state.\n\n\"I think you should be able to sit on your porch one day of your life and say, 'I truly own my home, and I'm no longer a partner in paying rent to the government in the form of property tax,'\" McDonnell told the Nebraska Examiner on Monday.\n\nAnother McDonnell bill, LB 77, would offer property tax relief for the portion of property taxes paid to the local school district, which is about 60% of annual property tax bills. Homeowners who have lived in the same house at least 10 years would be eligible.\n\nMcDonnell said that in 1965, voters decided to stop funding the government with state-level property taxes. Now, he said, Gov. Jim Pillen has tasked lawmakers to look at getting rid of most or all local K-12 school district taxes.\n\n\"Is that an overnight deal? No,\" McDonnell said. \"Is it a two-year, four-year, six-year [plan] -- I don't know -- but that's why we're here now in this special session to try and figure it out.\"\n\nThe state would replace the loss in local political subdivisions' revenue, similar to the current system for homestead exemptions. Qualified owners would need to refile for the relief in years divisible by five.\n\nLegislative Bill 79, from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, would similarly extend homestead exemptions. Based on household income, Nebraska residents could get a greater percentage of relief if they have lived in their home for two decades or more.\n\nAfter 20 years, they could claim an additional 2.5% in relief from their qualifying bracket. After 25 years, it would be an additional 5% in relief. Relief couldn't exceed 100%.\n\nState Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar dropped a package of 16 constitutional amendments Monday, which voters could consider this November together or individually.\n\nEight amendments would limit the taxing and spending authority of local governments as well as the state. The other eight allow private lawsuits to be filed to enforce the respective provisions.\n\n\"You need to have teeth because, otherwise, what's the remediation for taxpayers?\" Slama said.\n\nSlama said the package of legislation is based on the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights in Colorado, passed decades ago to lock in controls for tax growth.\n\nShe said she preferred \"one bill, one hearing and one message to give to taxpayers\" but decided to \"play it safe\" given the Nebraska Constitution's single-subject requirement for ballot measures.\n\nThe Nebraska Supreme Court has taken a stricter view of what constitutes a \"single subject\" for proposed laws or amendments on the ballot compared to laws passed by the Legislature.\n\nSlama has pushed for hard spending controls. She said the hard caps proposed by the governor on limiting annual property tax collection growth \"can be easily worked around\" and could get in the way of union negotiations for local law enforcement, firefighters and corrections officers.\n\n\"I think the only way to really put it in stone to get long-term relief is to put it in our state constitution, very clearly defined principles that need to be adhered to,\" Slama said.\n\nShe said Colorado has sustained \"pretty explosive growth\" during the decades since it passed its bill of rights.\n\nUnder Slama's proposals, the following limits would require voter approval during a statewide general election to:\n\nTwo other major proposals, from State Sens. Justin Wayne and Terrell McKinney, both of Omaha, would legalize, regulate and tax cannabis for adults ages 21 and older.\n\nLB 52, by Wayne, would set a regulatory framework for how cannabis could be grown, refined, manufactured, distributed, tested and sold, overseen by a commission the tax commissioner appoints.\n\nThe bill would earmark 20% of licenses for people in areas \"disproportionately harmed by cannabis prohibition.\" It would tax growers 25% when they sell it to a distributor or retailer and impose a 25% tax on retail sales. It would establish procedures to let people have previous cannabis-related convictions expunged or cleared from their records.\n\nMcKinney introduced similar provisions in 2023, through LB 634.\n\nLB 71, by McKinney, would create a regulatory regime for cannabis in Nebraska.\n\nIt would impose a 16% tax on grown cannabis to a manufacturer or store and a 16% sales tax on cannabis sales to customers. It shares essentially the same fee structure as Wayne's LB 52.\n\nIt also offers similar incentives for applicants from areas disproportionately impacted by cannabis enforcement.\n\nAs promised, Wayne also reintroduced a version of legislation that Pillen vetoed this spring that would allow lawsuits against political subdivisions for alleged negligence in certain cases of child sexual assault and child abuse.\n\nWayne's LB 57 includes broader reforms. That includes punitive damages and allowing other lawsuits if alleged governmental negligence was the proximate cause of someone's death, such as state prisoners.\n\nAnother Wayne bill, LB 67, would eliminate local tax rate authority for natural resources districts and have the state take over funding for the NRDs. It is modeled after the way the state took over responsibility to fund community colleges in 2023 and what the governor has said his three-year plan is for K-12 school districts.\n\nIn total, 81 bills and 24 constitutional amendments were introduced for the special session, the most proposed during any special session since the Unicameral formed in 1937.\n\nWayne led the way with 24 bills, followed by Slama with 16 pieces of legislation; State Sens. Carol Blood of Bellevue and McDonnell, at eight each; and State Sens. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln and Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, at five each.\n\nAmong other bills introduced Monday, the third and final day of bill introductions for the Legislature's special session on

The senator asked that the measure be pulled from the agenda on the final day of the state's regular legislative session after acknowledging that it did not have the votes to overcome a filibuster.\n\nThe new measures was introduced last week as part of a special legislative session called last week by Gov. Jim Pillen (R) to deal with the property tax issue. Some lawmakers on Friday attempted to cut short the special session, but that effort failed on a 34-4 vote.\n\nThe discussion on how to tax what the state calls \"consumable hemp,\" is part of a broader debate on how lawmakers want to balance sources of state revenue. Many lawmakers complain property taxes are too high, and proponents of the bill have said raising sales taxes would prevent further state reliance on property taxes to fund schools. Opponents, however, criticized the bill's overall increase in taxes, with some Democrats noting that sales taxes in particular would hit poorer Nebraskans hardest.\n\nThe measure's text defines consumable hemp products as finished products that contain hemp and that contain no more than 0.3 percent THC. Hemp products made from stalks or seed -- that is, for fiber or food use -- would not be included in the definition.\n\nLinehan's earlier measure, LB 388, initially contained a 100 percent tax rate on consumable hemp products. But following industry and consumer pushback, the proposed rate was reduced to 25 percent before the underlying tax bill was put on ice.\n\n\"The 100% tax was unworkable for CBD companies in our state. They were concerned it would drive them out of business,\" Sen. Anna Wishart (D), who's backed past efforts to end marijuana prohibition in the state, told Marijuana Moment in an email at the time. \"In talking with representatives from a group of CBD companies in the state, I worked with them and other senators to negotiate the tax down to 25%.\"\n\nDespite the failure of the earlier property-tax relief bill, Linehan said months ago that she'd be interested in returning to the issue during special session.\n\n\"I'm willing to come back this summer, this fall, whenever,\" she told Senate colleagues in April. \"But I hope we have a lot of conversations between now and then about all your perfect answers to this problem. Because it's easy to say, 'No, no, no.' That's real easy. So everybody who's saying we can do better, I hope you have those ideas to the Revenue Committee by the end of June.\"\n\nLinehan's new bill, LB 1, was referred to the unicameral legislature's Revenue Committee on Monday.\n\nTwo new legalization bills -- LB 52 from Sen. Justin Wayne (D) and LB 71 from Sen. Terrell McKinney (D) -- also landed in the legislature on Monday, which was the final day for lawmakers to file legislation for the special session. Wayne's bill, which was one of 23 introduced by the lawmaker that day, comes in at 162 pages, while McKinney's is 165 pages long.\n\nBoth bills would legalize, regulate and tax marijuana for adult use as well as take steps to provide relief for individuals with criminal records involving cannabis.\n\nOn the hemp tax issue, lawmakers have lamented that the many provisions in the earlier proposal seemed to come out of nowhere, although sponsor Linehan and others said on the floor at the time that the details were taken from other bills that lawmakers had introduced and debated. The hemp and CBD tax, for instance, ostensibly came out of LB 1341, introduced in January by Sen. Justin Wayne (D) and apparently never acted on by lawmakers.\n\nThat bill as introduced indeed would have increased taxes on consumable hemp, but only to 7.5 percent.\n\nThe latest proposal comes as the state, like others across the country, witnesses an explosion of hemp-derived products, including intoxicating cannabinoids such as delta-8 THC. Late last year, the state's attorney general, Mike Hilgers (R), filed suit against retailers in the state over their sale of delta-8 products.\n\nNeither medical nor adult-use cannabis are legal in Nebraska, though activists are hoping to change that, working to qualify two prospective medical cannabis initiatives for November's ballot.\n\nActivists earlier this month turned in what they hope will be more than enough signatures to qualify the measures -- the third time the campaign has sought to let voters decide on the reform in recent years.\n\nA recent poll by the campaign found 70 percent support in the state for legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nOrganizers at Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana (NMM) have been petitioning for the change since July, about two months after turning in a pair of complementary ballot proposals to the secretary of state's office.\n\nThe governor has already voiced opposition to the reform effort, saying in September that legalization \"poses demonstrated harms to our children,\" and that medical cannabis should only be accessible if its approved by FDA.\n\nLate last year, NMM told Marijuana Moment that the governor's argument was a \"cop out,\" and she says the campaign will let voters decide for themselves.\n\nOne of NMM's earlier campaigns gathered enough signatures for ballot placement in 2020, but the measure was invalidated by the state Supreme Court following a single-subject challenge. Supporters then came up short on signatures for revised petitions in 2022 due in large part to the loss of funding after one of their key donors died in a plane crash.\n\nNebraska lawmakers, including campaign co-chair Wishart, have also attempted to enact the reform legislatively, but cannabis bills have consistently stalled out in the conservative legislature.\n\nWishart's medical cannabis bill received a hearing in the unicameral Judiciary Committee in February, but it did not advance. She attributed the inaction to changes in committee membership. An earlier version of the measure ultimately stalled out in the GOP-controlled legislature amid a filibuster that supporters could not overcome.", "source": {"uri": "marijuanamoment.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marijuana Moment"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_adlin@marijuanamoment.net", "name": "Ben Adlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hemp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cannabidiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Pillen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Pillen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Ann_Linehan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lou Ann Linehan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tetrahydrocannabinol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legality of cannabis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_McKinney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrell McKinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Wayne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Wayne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unicameralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filibuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical cannabis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Hilgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Hilgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabinoid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.marijuanamoment.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kimzy-nanney-1562047-unsplash-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774020", "eventUri": "eng-9774020", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Jim Pillen's goal of reducing property taxes by $2.6 billion, an Omaha senator urged the Legislature to consider starting with a big line item on the state's balance sheet.\n\nSen. John Cavanaugh pitched his plan (LB17) to repeal the Perkins County Canal Project Act passed by lawmakers in 2022 and funded in 2023, returning approximately $571.4 million to the state's coffers to be used for property tax relief.\n\nCavanaugh told the Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday that any discussion about ending sales tax exemptions and slashing state spending should not ignore the Perkins County Canal.\n\n\"Removing this significant item from the state's budget would give the Legislature the opportunity to provide direct property tax relief to Nebraskans,\" Cavanaugh said.\n\nAn estimate from the Legislative Fiscal Office showed the state's general fund could recoup as much as $586.1 million on Jan. 1 if LB17 is passed, including funds that were set aside for other projects included in the Perkins County Canal Project Act.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Pete Ricketts in 2022, who said it was necessary to force Colorado to abide by the terms of the South Platte River Compact signed by both states and ratified by Congress in 1923.\n\nUnder the compact, Colorado agreed to allow 120 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water from the South Platte River to flow into Nebraska during irrigation season, as well as 500 cfs of water to flow into the Cornhusker state during non-irrigating seasons.\n\nTo secure the full terms of the agreement, Nebraska is required to build a canal -- a project it started and later abandoned in 1890. Plans drawn up in the 1980s show the canal originating near Ovid, Colorado, and cutting across southern Keith County in Nebraska, filling a series of reservoirs along the way.\n\nBackers of the plan said it would secure an important resource for the future of the state as well as protect the river from being guzzled up by fast-growing population centers in eastern Colorado.\n\nBut an analysis conducted by the Legislative Research Office in 2023 was less optimistic about the return on investment for the canal than a third-party contractor hired by the state to study the issue.\n\nCavanaugh, who said he sees the potential value of the Perkins County Canal, has argued the state should take a more measured approach to its construction.\n\nIn 2023, he unsuccessfully attempted to stop the transfer of $125 million more from the state's cash reserve into the canal fund to build what he called the \"Cadillac\" canal rather than the economic version.\n\nThe Legislature instead moved forward with Pillen's plan for a $574.5 million canal, which would double the capacity to 1,000 cfs.\n\nTo date, along with money already spent, Nebraska has appropriated more than $628 million for the project and has begun to purchase land in Colorado for the proposed canal.\n\nSen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte called Cavanaugh's proposal to end the canal project \"incredibly foolish,\" adding ending the project now would signal Nebraska was giving up its rights to the South Platte River.\n\nCavanaugh responded that because the state was looking for any savings it could funnel into property tax relief, nothing should be out-of-bounds.\n\n\"We're clearly having a conversation about how we don't have the money,\" Cavanaugh said. \"This is the largest single pot of money we have sitting out there.\"\n\nSen. Mike Moser of Columbus said that even if the Legislature were to pass Cavanaugh's bill, the savings would equal about 10% of the total amount of property taxes collected in the state. In turn, that money would only provide one-time relief to property taxpayers, he added.\n\n\"If we spend that money on lowering property taxes once, then the next year you're going to have to raise them again,\" Moser said. \"I think we need to look at it in a long-term picture. It's more important to build this project and protect our water rights than have a one-time savings.\"\n\nNatural resources district managers also opposed Cavanaugh's plan, saying that the project was far too important for the state's future to be considered as part of sweeping cuts to state government spending.\n\nDevin Brundage, the general manager of Central Nebraska Public Power District in Gothenburg, asked the Natural Resources Committee to \"differentiate between spending cuts and investment cuts,\" adding lawmakers 100 years ago had wisely created an agreement that gives Nebraska access to the South Platte now.\n\nAnd Kent Miller, the general manager for Twin Platte Natural Resource District in North Platte, who has advocated for construction of the canal for four decades, said development on Colorado's Front Range has caused water usage on the South Platte to reach what he called \"a tipping point.\"\n\n\"I think if you take the funding away you're killing the project,\" Miller said.\n\nCavanaugh said the canal has potential value for the state, but said front-loading money to build it had put the state in a difficult situation as it continues to work toward Pillen's goal of reducing property taxes.\n\n\"We're talking about raising taxes on folks to make that front-loading work,\" Cavanaugh said.\n\nThe Natural Resources Committee did not immediately take any action on LB17 on Tuesday.\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7120 or cdunker@journalstar.com.\n\nOn Twitter @ChrisDunkerLJS\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet

The project eventually was abandoned due to financial troubles. But remnants are still visible near Julesburg.\n\nCHRIS DUNKER Lincoln Journal Star\n\nAs Nebraska lawmakers explore ways to meet Gov. Jim Pillen's goal of reducing property taxes by $2.6 billion, an Omaha senator urged the Legislature to consider starting with a big line item on the state's balance sheet.\n\nSen. John Cavanaugh pitched his plan (LB17) to repeal the Perkins County Canal Project Act passed by lawmakers in 2022 and funded in 2023, returning approximately $571.4 million to the state's coffers to be used for property tax relief.\n\nCavanaugh told the Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday that any discussion about ending sales tax exemptions and slashing state spending should not ignore the Perkins County Canal.\n\n\"Removing this significant item from the state's budget would give the Legislature the opportunity to provide direct property tax relief to Nebraskans,\" Cavanaugh said.\n\nAn estimate from the Legislative Fiscal Office showed the state's general fund could recoup as much as $586.1 million on Jan. 1 if LB17 is passed, including funds that were set aside for other projects included in the Perkins County Canal Project Act.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Pete Ricketts in 2022, who said it was necessary to force Colorado to abide by the terms of the South Platte River Compact signed by both states and ratified by Congress in 1923.\n\nUnder the compact, Colorado agreed to allow 120 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water from the South Platte River to flow into Nebraska during irrigation season, as well as 500 cfs of water to flow into the Cornhusker state during non-irrigating seasons.\n\nTo secure the full terms of the agreement, Nebraska is required to build a canal -- a project it started and later abandoned in 1890. Plans drawn up in the 1980s show the canal originating near Ovid, Colorado, and cutting across southern Keith County in Nebraska, filling a series of reservoirs along the way.\n\nBackers of the plan said it would secure an important resource for the future of the state as well as protect the river from being guzzled up by fast-growing population centers in eastern Colorado.\n\nBut an analysis conducted by the Legislative Research Office in 2023 was less optimistic about the return on investment for the canal than a third-party contractor hired by the state to study the issue.\n\nCavanaugh, who said he sees the potential value of the Perkins County Canal, has argued the state should take a more measured approach to its construction.\n\nIn 2023, he unsuccessfully attempted to stop the transfer of $125 million more from the state's cash reserve into the canal fund to build what he called the \"Cadillac\" canal rather than the economic version.\n\nThe Legislature instead moved forward with Pillen's plan for a $574.5 million canal, which would double the capacity to 1,000 cfs.\n\nTo date, along with money already spent, Nebraska has appropriated more than $628 million for the project and has begun to purchase land in Colorado for the proposed canal.\n\nSen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte called Cavanaugh's proposal to end the canal project \"incredibly foolish,\" adding ending the project now would signal Nebraska was giving up its rights to the South Platte River.\n\nCavanaugh responded that because the state was looking for any savings it could funnel into property tax relief, nothing should be out-of-bounds.\n\n\"We're clearly having a conversation about how we don't have the money,\" Cavanaugh said. \"This is the largest single pot of money we have sitting out there.\"\n\nSen. Mike Moser of Columbus said that even if the Legislature were to pass Cavanaugh's bill, the savings would equal about 10% of the total amount of property taxes collected in the state. In turn, that money would only provide one-time relief to property taxpayers, he added.\n\n\"If we spend that money on lowering property taxes once, then the next year you're going to have to raise them again,\" Moser said. \"I think we need to look at it in a long-term picture. It's more important to build this project and protect our water rights than have a one-time savings.\"\n\nNatural resources district managers also opposed Cavanaugh's plan, saying that the project was far too important for the state's future to be considered as part of sweeping cuts to state government spending.\n\nDevin Brundage, the general manager of Central Nebraska Public Power District in Gothenburg, asked the Natural Resources Committee to \"differentiate between spending cuts and investment cuts,\" adding lawmakers 100 years ago had wisely created an agreement that gives Nebraska access to the South Platte now.\n\nAnd Kent Miller, the general manager for Twin Platte Natural Resource District in North Platte, who has advocated for construction of the canal for four decades, said development on Colorado's Front Range has caused water usage on the South Platte to reach what he called \"a tipping point.\"\n\n\"I think if you take the funding away you're killing the project,\" Miller said.\n\nCavanaugh said the canal has potential value for the state, but said front-loading money to build it had put the state in a difficult situation as it continues to work toward Pillen's goal of reducing property taxes.\n\n\"We're talking about raising taxes on folks to make that front-loading work,\" Cavanaugh said.\n\nThe Natural Resources Committee did not immediately take any action on LB17 on Tuesday.\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7120 or cdunker@journalstar.com.\n\nOn Twitter @ChrisDunkerLJS\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your

Jim Pillen's plan to reduce property taxes by 50% were met with mixed reviews from Nebraska government officials, with some state leaders saying the losses will prompt fee increases or layoffs.\n\nThe Nebraska Legislature's Appropriations Committee heard testimony on Legislative Bill 2 and Legislative Bill 3 Tuesday, which encompass the budget changes Pillen is suggesting under his plan. A majority of testifiers opposed the bills. Separately, the Legislature's Revenue Committee heard LB 1, which contains Pillen's proposed tax changes, Tuesday. Those changes were also broadly panned.\n\nThe two bills, heard as part of a special session Pillen called this month to enact property tax reductions, would reduce the state's cash reserve by $200 million, remove carryover funds leftover from past fiscal years by $116 million, cut ongoing appropriations to the state's general fund by roughly $83 million per year, and eliminate interest accruals in various cash funds, estimated to create about $40 million in savings each year.\n\nSome of these cuts would be made up of smaller cuts to government programs during the current two-year budget period, ranging from $25,000 from the Lieutenant Governor's Office to over $80 million from programs within the Department of Health and Human Services, DHHS. Some of those cuts would be offset by transfers from other cash funds.\n\nOfficials from several agencies, including the Game and Parks Commission and the state Fire Marshal's Office, claimed the cuts would force them to increase service fees to make up for the losses. Game and Parks Director Timothy McCoy estimated the commission would have to increase fees by 26%, which could impact the cost of park entry, camping reservations or other services.\n\nHeidi Ore with Nebraska's Foster Care Review Office said the $500,000 the governor's plan would cut from the office over two years makes up more than 10% of the office's base appropriations, and could lead to more reductions in federal dollars, which are matched with state funds. She said these cuts would force the office to lay off some of its workers.\n\n\"We ask that you not cut corners when it comes to the lives of children in out-of-home care,\" Ore said.\n\nState Sen. Raymond Aguilar of Grand Island testified on the $7.5 million in proposed cuts to the Legislature, as the current chair of the legislative Executive Board. He said the cuts would impact salaries, operating expenses, travel reimbursements and other items used by legislative workers, and would prompt the Executive Board to request increases in the general fund next year.\n\nWhile carryover funds are viewed as unspent dollars under Pillen's plan, during the hearing several people noted some of those dollars are already spoken for. Nebraska Public Service Commissioner Dan Watermeier said the Public Service Commission has obligated nearly all of the $20 million they were slated to distribute as grants for broadband service projects, and yet LB 2 would cut $5 million of that funding, putting the program in jeopardy.\n\nSen. Tony Vargas of Omaha, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, questioned whether the cuts to carryover funds sends the wrong message to state departments, encouraging them to spend all the money they have immediately and not look for ways to save. Budget Director Lee Will noted unspent dollars already lapse back into the state's general fund.\n\nSecretary of State Bob Evnen countered that this is a reason to leave appropriated funds untouched. His office is facing an immediate $250,000 cut from its elections operations under Pillen's plan, and Evnen argued those funds are necessary, as his office is still working to implementing the new voter ID law that passed this year in the lead up to the general election.\n\nA handful of agency representatives supported the budget bills, including DHHS CEO Steve Corsi, despite facing some of the largest cuts. Corsi claimed the cuts wouldn't reduce any DHHS services and would lead to improvements.\n\n\"I am absolutely not concerned about the future,\" Corsi said.\n\nJust before being appointed as DHHS CEO, Corsi worked for Utah consulting company Epiphany Associates. Pillen entered Nebraska into a $10 million contract with Epiphany in an effort to reduce government waste. Although news of the contract broke after Corsi stopped working at the company, the contract was signed when he was still employed there.\n\nEpiphany members worked with Pillen on his tax proposal. Epiphany CEO Kristen Cox testified before the Appropriations Committee Tuesday. She claimed it is possible to improve government services through budget cuts, as long as the improvements are focused in key areas that limit deficiencies.\n\n\"There's huge hidden capacity in these systems, but we do not have the tools to detect it,\" Cox said.\n\nDespite Corsi's optimistic outlook, roughly a dozen other testifiers said they were concerned about the proposed DHHS cuts, including representatives from the Nebraska Hospital Association, the University of Nebraska system and the Greater Omaha Chamber. Critics of the plan claimed the cuts would hinder medical research, devastate the infrastructure of local health departments and reduce health care access for vulnerable Nebraskans.\n\nPillen has said state government should learn to \"do more with less.\" But Justin Hubly, executive director of the state employees union, countered that many government agencies are already operating with limited resources and staff shortages.\n\n\"Doing more with less is not going so well right now,\" Hubly said.\n\nGovernment-politics Gov.

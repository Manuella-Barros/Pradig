grandfather\".\n\nPeter Wrighton, from Banham, Norfolk, was repeatedly stabbed in the neck and head on Saturday morning.\n\nNo arrests have been made since his body was found by a member of the public in woodland near the Fiveways Junction close to the village of East Harling.\n\nThe family of retired BT worker Mr Wrighton, who had been married for 59 years, paid tribute to his \"kind nature\" and his \"love of walking his dogs and chatting with people to pass the time of day\".\n\nThey said: \"Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him.\n\n\"We are extremely thankful for all the people who have come forward to speak with the police and hope we will soon be able to understand why this has happened.\n\n\"When we think of Peter, we remember him with fond and happy memories that will stay with us always.\"\n\nMr Wrighton retired to Norfolk 30 years ago after a 35-year career with BT.\n\nMurder detectives are continuing to investigate his death and believe a member of the public could hold the key to finding his killer.\n\nChief Superintendent Mike Fawcett moved to reassure people that detectives are following \"several lines of inquiry\" and said police had received more than 100 calls in the last three days.\n\nHe urged people who were in the area between 9am and 11am on Saturday to contact police, and for local residents and businesses within a five-mile radius of the murder scene to check their bins, gardens and outbuildings for any discarded items, such as bloodstained clothing or a knife.\n\nHe also asked for businesses and premises in the area with CCTV systems to preserve footage relating to 6am to 9pm on Saturday, and for those with dash cams to keep footage and contact police.\n\n\"We remain concerned that we have not yet been able to trace the person or people responsible for Peter's death,\" said Mr Fawcett.\n\n\"I hope residents will take some reassurance from the increased policing presence today which will be continuing throughout the evening and as long as is necessary, but I am aware that this incident will be causing some to worry.\n\n\"I would ask people to remain vigilant and to contact us if they see anything suspicious.\"\n\nHe described Mr Wrighton as of slim build, 5ft 7in, with grey hair and glasses.\n\nHe said Mr Wrighton was wearing blue/grey trousers, a black T-shirt and brown walking boots when he was killed, had driven his red Skoda Fabia car to the woods and was walking his 10-year-old foxhound cross and 13-year-old trailhound cross.", "time": "15:15:00"}

residents and businesses within a five-mile radius of the murder scene to check their bins, gardens and outbuildings for any discarded items, such as bloodstained clothing or a knife.\n\nHe also asked for businesses and premises in the area with CCTV systems to preserve footage relating to 6am to 9pm on Saturday, and for those with dash cams to keep footage and contact police.\n\n\"We remain concerned that we have not yet been able to trace the person or people responsible for Peter's death,\" said Mr Fawcett.\n\n\"I hope residents will take some reassurance from the increased policing presence today which will be continuing throughout the evening and as long as is necessary, but I am aware that this incident will be causing some to worry.\n\n\"I would ask people to remain vigilant and to contact us if they see anything suspicious.\"\n\nHe described Mr Wrighton as of slim build, 5ft 7in, with grey hair and glasses.\n\nHe said Mr Wrighton was wearing blue/grey trousers, a black T-shirt and brown walking boots when he was killed, had driven his red Skoda Fabia car to the woods and was walking his 10-year-old foxhound cross and 13-year-old trailhound cross.", "time":

descriptions of three potential witnesses who they are keen to trace in connection with the brutal knifing of Peter Wrighton - as well as a map showing the path he walked.\n\nHe was repeatedly stabbed in the neck and head before his body was found in woodland near the village of East Harling in Norfolk on Saturday morning.\n\nThere have been no arrests - and no weapon has yet been found.\n\nCCTV footage released this evening show Mr Wrighton shopping inside a unnamed local shop on Saturday - the day of the attack.\n\nBespectacled Mr Wrighton, whose hair is grey, can be seen apparently at ease, dressed in a black T-shirt and dark trousers, carrying items he is buying to the till and paying for them with his wallet.\n\nPolice said tonight they are trying to trace a man in his 50s seen changing his T-shirt in a place called The Street, another aged 25-30 wearing flip-flops and a third aged 30-50 seen walking a dog.\n\nDetective Superintendent Andy Smith, who is overseeing the investigation, said: \"This, as you will appreciate is a large-scale, complex and detailed investigation which involves a number of strands.\n\n\"Our main lines of inquiry include forensic investigations, extensive searches, witness interviews, house-to-house inquiries, CCTV capture and review and close liaison, as you'd understand, with Peter's family and our thoughts are with Peter's family at this difficult time.\"\n\nMr Wrighton was from Banham in Norfolk. Speaking at a press conference at the county's police HQ today, DS Smith appealed to people who may have been in the Harling Woods area.\n\n\"We need to speak to anyone who has recently visited and/or frequents the area where Peter's body was found,\" he said.\n\n\"This could include dog walkers, runners and ramblers.\n\n\"We want to talk to you if you have seen Peter walk his dogs in that area or nearby in recent months or weeks but in particular on the day Peter's body was found, Saturday August 5.\"\n\nHe said officers were appealing specifically to three men who police are yet to trace as potential witnesses.\n\nThe first is described as a slim white male over 50, with pale skin and grey or white hair and balding on top.\n\nHe was believed to be wearing heavy-rimmed glasses and light-coloured trousers, and was seen in The Street changing into a white T-shirt.\n\nThe second potential witness is a white male with a tanned complexion, aged 25 to 30, 5ft 9in to 5ft 11in, with an athletic build, short, dark wavy hair and dark eyes.\n\nHe wore a grey or blue t-shirt, grey floppy gym-style shorts above the knee and heavy duty flip flops, and was seen within the boundary of the woodland site which police are searching.\n\nThe third man is described as a white male, aged 30 to 50, of medium build, who wore dark-coloured clothing and was seen walking without a dog in the northern area of the heath.\n\n\"These are descriptions of people that we believe were in the area, not necessarily together but we're keen to trace them as part of our ongoing appeal to trace witnesses in the relevant area at the relevant time,\" said DS Smith.\n\nHe said officers were working with National Crime Agency experts on the investigation.\n\n\"We want to help Peter's family and the people in the local area to understand what happened,\" he said. \"This is a particularly brutal murder.\n\n\"To do this we need to piece together Peter's final movements so that we can understand what happened to him and why.\n\n\"This means we want to hear from you if you know something or you know someone who has information but who is for whatever reason reluctant to come forward themselves.\"\n\nAn inquest into Mr Wrighton's death has been opened and adjourned, and the medical cause of death was recorded as \"incised wounds to the neck\".\n\n- Anyone with any information about the murder or any suspicious activity should contact Norfolk Police immediately on 0800 056 0944 or 0207 158 0010, quoting Operation Graduate, visit the mobile police station or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.", "time": "17:53:00"}

investigation\n\nA witness has revealed that she saw two elderly men arguing in a wood as police hunt the killer of an 83-year-old dog walker savagely knifed to death.\n\nPeter Wrighton died of stab wounds to the head and neck on Saturday in East Harling, Norfolk, at the same spot where an unsolved rape happened more than 20 years ago.\n\nIt is understood that a witness told detectives earlier in the week that he saw two elderly men involved in a heated discussion in the woodland.\n\nThe sighting is thought to have taken place on Saturday morning, shortly before the brutal killing of Mr Wrighton.\n\nToday Norfolk Police released footage of Mr Wrighton, on the day that he died, and maps of his final movements in the hope that it would 'jog memories'.\n\nThe dog walker stabbed to death in broad daylight has been named as 83-year-old Peter Wrighton\n\nAs the probe entered its seventh day last night, detectives said they want to speak to three men in connection with the murder, including one seen changing into a fresh T-shirt on the road where the victim parked his car.\n\nDetectives admitted it took them two days before they launched a full murder inquiry into the former BT worker's death, because they initially believed he may have been mauled by an animal.\n\nOfficers said they were 'concerned' that they have still made no arrests and admitted 'many lines' of inquiry remain open. The murder weapon has yet to be found, and police do not know whether Mr Wrighton knew his attacker or any motive.\n\nAmong other theories is the suggestion that he could have been attacked by travellers previously seen camping in the forest.\n\nPolice will also explore whether Mr Wrighton could have been the victim of a mistaken identity.\n\nMr Wrighton approaches the till of his local post office as he shops for some items moments before his brutal death\n\nMr Wrighton, from East Harling, in Norfolk, was found dead by woodland after visiting this post office\n\nPolice hope this CCTV footage and stills will help jog the memories of potential witnesses to Mr Wrighton's murder\n\nAmong other theories is the suggestion that he could have been attacked by travellers previously seen camping in the forest.\n\nPolice will also explore whether Mr Wrighton could have been the victim of a mistaken identity.\n\nHis name is similar to that of notorious paedophile Peter Righton, who lived just 16 miles away, but died a decade ago.\n\nThe crime scene, on the outskirts of East Harling, is also less than two miles from a campsite, and last night police confirmed they are trying to track down those who stayed there in case the killer was visiting the area.\n\nThe third is a white man, aged 30 to 50 years old, of a medium build wearing dark coloured clothing. He was seen walking without a dog in the northern area of the heath.\n\nDet Supt Andy Smith said officers hoped the CCTV and maps would help jog the memories of potential witnesses.\n\nHe said: 'On behalf of Peter's family, we continue to ask for information. We want to hear from you if you are someone who knows this area or frequents it, perhaps to walk or run.\n\n'We want to hear from you if you have seen Peter walk his dogs in that area or nearby in recent weeks or months, but especially on Saturday 5th August.\n\n'I have released a map of the route that Peter travelled on Saturday and an image of him on CCTV from a local shop with the hope it will jog memories.\n\nLabelled on this map is the post office where Mr Wrighton was seen on CCTV and where he was found by a patch of woodland\n\nOne of the men detectives wish to speak to was seen in the area marked in red on this map\n\nPolice say this is Mr Wrighton's car, which was found near to the woodland area\n\n'We want to hear from you if you know someone who has information but who is, for whatever reason, reluctant to come forward themselves.\n\n'I am extremely grateful to those persons who have already engaged with us and provided valuable information. I would like to reassure those still thinking of coming forward that, if required, we are able to treat your information in confidence.\n\n'We want to piece together Peter's final days so that we can understand what happened to him and why. We know that Peter's family and the people of the local area want to understand and we want to help them to do that.'\n\nResidents in Mr Wrighton's home town of Banham, Norfolk have today paid tribute to their beloved neighbour.\n\nPhil Moore, parish secretary of St Mary the Virgin Church in Banham, Norfolk, had known Peter Wrighton for around 15 years as he donated to the food bank.\n\nMr Moore said: 'I knew him because he used to walk his dogs. He'd always wave and we'd stand and chat and that's how I got to know him.\n\n'He was a very quiet man and a gentle man. He was a lovely man - very kind and very generous. He used to donate to the food bank at the church.'\n\nThe retired BT worker was described by his family as a 'lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather'\n\nPeter had worked for British Telecom for 35 years and retired to Banham, Norfolk, 30 years ago where his family said he enjoyed living a simple life with his family and dogs\n\nMr Moore described Mr Wrighton telling him just weeks ago that he had recently started taking his dogs to the woods at East Harling because it was easier to let them off the lead.\n\nHe called the incident 'terrible', saying: 'I don't think he would've expected it. I don't think he had the sort of mind where he would be expecting a horrible thing to happen.\n\n'He wouldn't have had a grievance with anyone or anything, that's for certain. He was totally inoffensive. He wasn't an argumentative sort of man.\n\n'I was absolutely horrified before they even released his name. They then said about a red Skoda and at first it didn't click, but then the penny dropped.\n\n'I just had a sinking feeling and said: 'I think I know who it was.'\n\n'It's quite horrific what's happened to him. What sort of person would do that?\n\n'I hope they can find who did it. It would be sad to think of it going unsolved. For his family's sake, they want peace of mind.'\n\nIn a statement released this yesterday, his wife Ann and family said: 'Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him.\n\n'We are extremely thankful for all the people who have come forward to speak with the police and hope we will soon be able to understand why this has happened.\n\n'When we think of Peter we remember him with with fond and happy memories that will stay with us always.'\n\nMr Wrighton had worked for British Telecom for 35 years and retired to Banham, Norfolk, 30 years ago where his family said he enjoyed living a simple life with his family and dogs.\n\nHis two beloved dogs, a ten-year-old foxhound-cross and a 13-year-old trailhound-cross, stayed by him until a fellow walker found his body.\n\nMr Wrighton's two dogs, a ten-year-old foxhound-cross and a 13-year-old trailhound-cross, stayed by him until a fellow walker found his body\n\nScenes of crime officers hunt for clues in the area where Mr Wrighton's lifeless body was found\n\nTerry Ransom, 73, said he and his wife walked where Mr Wrighton was found nearly every day - and the elderly victim could have stumbled upon a drug deal.\n\nHe said: 'I have been coming up here for 20 years and the woods have become more dodgy. The area is a bit scary.'\n\nHe added: 'I am used to seeing people drawing up in cars. You see them exchanging something. I am sure it is to do with drugs.\n\n'At around the end of June I saw two men. One looked like he was hiding things in the wood while the other was keeping watch.\n\n'Two days later I saw a teenager come to a stop in the same area and he picked up a package which he put in his pocket.'\n\nA post-mortem examination found that Mr Wrighton died after he was repeatedly stabbed in the neck and head.\n\nFriends and neighbours have paid tribute to Peter Wrighton after hearing how he was brutally murdered.\n\nClaire Hansey, 52, said: 'He was a nice bloke, just a lovely bloke.\n\n'You don't expect to be murdered, particularly after getting to that age, not when you're walking dogs.\n\nPictured is Mr Wrighton's home in Banham, Norwich. Police are continuing to appeal for information to help find Mr Wrighton's killer and still believe that the public may hold the key\n\n'He was polite and if you did see him you put your hand up and that was it.\n\n'He and his wife used to have cats too, they were animal lovers. It is horrible, that poor lady.\n\n'You just hoped that they catch whoever it is because it wasn't just a knock on the head, it was absolutely horrific. That poor man.'\n\nMelissa Nelson, 39, who lives nearby, said: 'Peter was a true gentleman who wouldn't hurt a fly.\n\n'I would often see him out about and while he wasn't the centre of attention, he was always very polite to everyone he spoke to.\n\n'He absolutely loved his dogs and would do anything for him. It's no surprise they stayed with him in his hour of need.\n\n'It's heartbreaking what happened to him, you wouldn't wish it on your worst enemy. I hope he is at peace now.'\n\nLocals told how Mr Wrighton, who lived in London until his retirement, spent his days walking his dogs and caring for animals without a home at the Dogs Trust charity.\n\nNorfolk Police are continuing to appeal for information to help find Mr Wrighton's killer and still believe that the public may hold the key.\n\nNorfolk's County Policing Commander, Chief Superintendent Mike Fawcett, said: 'I would like to reassure the public that we are following several lines of enquiry and are pleased the public are supporting us in our investigation.\n\nIt is understood that the pensioner had gone to walk his dogs alone between 9am and 11am\n\n'We have received more than 100 calls in the last three days and we would continue to urge people with information, particularly those who were in the area between 9am and 11m, to make contact.\n\n'I would like to ask again, that if you live within five miles of The Street please can you check your bins, gardens and outbuildings for any items which may have been discarded by a potential suspect.\n\n'I would also request that premises or businesses within the same area with CCTV systems preserve any footage that relate to the hours of 6am until 9pm on Saturday 5th August.\n\n'Similarly, if you have a dash-cam or other recording devices and travelled in the area, save the footage and contact the police.\n\n'We remain concerned that we have not yet been able to trace the person or people responsible for Peter's death.\n\n'I hope residents will take some reassurance from the increased policing presence today which will be continuing throughout the evening and as long as is necessary, but I am aware that this incident will be causing some to worry.\n\n'I would ask people to remain vigilant and to contact us if they see anything suspicious.'\n\nPolice are investigating the possibility that Mr Wrighton was killed after stumbling upon a drug deal, after locals suggested the wood was a hotbed for dealers", "time": "21:49:00"}

Google Plus Share this article with Whatsapp Share this article through email Share this article through sms\n\nMurder detectives have released CCTV showing an 83-year-old dog walker at a post office just minutes before he was stabbed to death.\n\nPeter Wrighton, from The Moor, Banham, Norfolk, died after being repeatedly stabbed in the neck, head and body in woodland near the village of East Harling on Saturday morning.\n\nVillage to open 'mini houses' for homeless people\n\nThere have been no arrests, and no weapon has been found.\n\nToday, officers released the footage along with descriptions of three potential witnesses who they are keen to trace.\n\nDetective Superintendent Andy Smith, who is overseeing the investigation, said: 'This, as you will appreciate is a large-scale, complex and detailed investigation which involves a number of strands.\n\n'Our main lines of inquiry include forensic investigations, extensive searches, witness interviews, house-to-house inquiries, CCTV capture and review and close liaison, as you'd understand, with Peter's family and our thoughts are with Peter's family at this difficult time.'\n\nIn the video, Mr Wrighton can be seen wandering around the post office.\n\nMan who left dogs to starve on a balcony handed jail sentence\n\nPolice said they hope the video of his final movements will 'jog memories'.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at Norfolk Police's headquarters today, DS Smith appealed to people who may have been in the Harling Woods area.\n\nHe said: 'We need to speak to anyone who has recently visited and/or frequents the area where Peter's body was found.\n\n'This could include dog walkers, runners and ramblers.\n\n'We want to talk to you if you have seen Peter walk his dogs in that area or nearby in recent months or weeks but in particular on the day Peter's body was found, Saturday August 5.'\n\nHe said officers were appealing specifically to three men who police are yet to trace as potential witnesses.\n\nThe first is described as a slim white male over 50, with pale skin and grey or white hair, balding on top.\n\nTwo people hurt after incident involving mystery substance outside hospital\n\nHe was believed to be wearing heavy-rimmed glasses and light-coloured trousers, and was seen in The Street changing into a white t-shirt.\n\nThe second potential witness is a white male with a tanned complexion, aged 25 to 30, 5ft 9in to 5ft 11in, with an athletic build, short, dark wavy hair and dark eyes.\n\nHe wore a grey or blue t-shirt, grey floppy gym-style shorts above the knee and heavy duty flip flops, and was seen within the boundary of the woodland site which police are searching.\n\nThe third man is described as a white male, aged 30 to 50, of medium build, who wore dark-coloured clothing and was seen walking without a dog in the northern area of the heath.\n\nDS Smith said: 'These are descriptions of people that we believe were in the area, not necessarily together but we're keen to trace them as part of our ongoing appeal to trace witnesses in the relevant area at the relevant time.'\n\nHe said officers were working with National Crime Agency experts on the investigation.\n\n'We want to help Peter's family and the people in the local area to understand what happened,' he said.\n\nPictured: Schoolgirl jailed for scarring classmate with acid in row over boy\n\n'This is a particularly brutal murder.\n\n'To do this we need to piece together Peter's final movements so that we can understand what happened to him and why.\n\n'This means we want to hear from you if you know something or you know someone who has information but who is for whatever reason reluctant to come forward themselves.'\n\nAn inquest into Mr Wrighton's death has been opened and adjourned, and the medical cause of death was recorded as 'incised wounds to the neck'.", "time": "18:27:00"}

released descriptions of three men they wish to speak to about the brutal murder.\n\nRetired BT worker Peter Wrighton died of stab wounds to the head and neck on Saturday in East Harling at the same spot where an unsolved rape happened more than 20 years ago.\n\nToday police are urging three men, who are not being treated as suspects, to come forward to assist the investigation.\n\nThe dog walker stabbed to death in broad daylight has been named as 83-year-old Peter Wrighton\n\nThe first is a white male, aged over 50, of slim build with pale skin, heavy dimmed glasses and white coloured trousers.\n\nThe second is a white tanned male, between 5'9 and 5'11 tall, of athletic build, with short dark wavy hair, dark eyes and heavy duty flip flops.\n\nThe third is a white male, of medium build, who was wearing dark coloured clothing.\n\nNorfolk Police Ch Supt Mike Fawcett, said: 'We are appealing for anyone who may have seen any of these men, who may not have been together, to come forward and speak to the police as soon as possible.\n\n'To clarify, they are not suspects, they may be witnesses.'\n\nResidents in Mr Wrighton's home town of Banham, Norfolk have today paid tribute to their beloved neighbour.\n\nPhil Moore, parish secretary of St Mary the Virgin Church in Banham, Norfolk, had known Peter Wrighton for around 15 years as he donated to the food bank.\n\nMr Moore said: 'I knew him because he used to walk his dogs. He'd always wave and we'd stand and chat and that's how I got to know him.\n\n'He was a very quiet man and a gentle man. He was a lovely man - very kind and very generous. He used to donate to the food bank at the church.'\n\nThe retired BT worker was described by his family as a 'lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather'\n\nPeter had worked for British Telecom for 35 years and retired to Banham, Norfolk, 30 years ago where his family said he enjoyed living a simple life with his family and dogs\n\nMr Moore described Mr Wrighton telling him just weeks ago that he had recently started taking his dogs to the woods at East Harling because it was easier to let them off the lead.\n\nHe called the incident 'terrible', saying: 'I don't think he would've expected it. I don't think he had the sort of mind where he would be expecting a horrible thing to happen.\n\n'He wouldn't have had a grievance with anyone or anything, that's for certain. He was totally inoffensive. He wasn't an argumentative sort of man.\n\n'I was absolutely horrified before they even released his name. They then said about a red Skoda and at first it didn't click, but then the penny dropped.\n\n'I just had a sinking feeling and said: 'I think I know who it was.'\n\n'It's quite horrific what's happened to him. What sort of person would do that?\n\n'I hope they can find who did it. It would be sad to think of it going unsolved. For his family's sake, they want peace of mind.'\n\nIn a statement released this yesterday, his wife Ann and family said: 'Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him.\n\n'We are extremely thankful for all the people who have come forward to speak with the police and hope we will soon be able to understand why this has happened.\n\n'When we think of Peter we remember him with with fond and happy memories that will stay with us always.'\n\nMr Wrighton had worked for British Telecom for 35 years and retired to Banham, Norfolk, 30 years ago where his family said he enjoyed living a simple life with his family and dogs.\n\nHis two beloved dogs, a ten-year-old foxhound-cross and a 13-year-old trailhound-cross, stayed by him until a fellow walker found his body.\n\nMr Wrighton's two dogs, a ten-year-old foxhound-cross and a 13-year-old trailhound-cross, stayed by him until a fellow walker found his body\n\nScenes of crime officers hunt for clues in the area where Mr Wrighton's lifeless body was found\n\nTerry Ransom, 73, said he and his wife walked where Mr Wrighton was found nearly every day - and the elderly victim could have stumbled upon a drug deal.\n\nHe said: 'I have been coming up here for 20 years and the woods have become more dodgy. The area is a bit scary.'\n\nHe added: 'I am used to seeing people drawing up in cars. You see them exchanging something. I am sure it is to do with drugs.\n\n'At around the end of June I saw two men. One looked like he was hiding things in the wood while the other was keeping watch.\n\n'Two days later I saw a teenager come to a stop in the same area and he picked up a package which he put in his pocket.'\n\nA post-mortem examination found that Mr Wrighton died after he was repeatedly stabbed in the neck and head.\n\nFriends and neighbours have paid tribute to Peter Wrighton after hearing how he was brutally murdered.\n\nClaire Hansey, 52, said: 'He was a nice bloke, just a lovely bloke.\n\n'You don't expect to be murdered, particularly after getting to that age, not when you're walking dogs.\n\nPictured is Mr Wrighton's home in Banham, Norwich. Police are continuing to appeal for information to help find Mr Wrighton's killer and still believe that the public may hold the key\n\n'He was polite and if you did see him you put your hand up and that was it.\n\n'He and his wife used to have cats too, they were animal lovers. It is horrible, that poor lady.\n\n'You just hoped that they catch whoever it is because it wasn't just a knock on the head, it was absolutely horrific. That poor man.'\n\nMelissa Nelson, 39, who lives nearby, said: 'Peter was a true gentleman who wouldn't hurt a fly.\n\n'I would often see him out about and while he wasn't the centre of attention, he was always very polite to everyone he spoke to.\n\n'He absolutely loved his dogs and would do anything for him. It's no surprise they stayed with him in his hour of need.\n\n'It's heartbreaking what happened to him, you wouldn't wish it on your worst enemy. I hope he is at peace now.'\n\nLocals told how Mr Wrighton, who lived in London until his retirement, spent his days walking his dogs and caring for animals without a home at the Dogs Trust charity.\n\nNorfolk Police are continuing to appeal for information to help find Mr Wrighton's killer and still believe that the public may hold the key.\n\nNorfolk's County Policing Commander, Chief Superintendent Mike Fawcett, said: 'I would like to reassure the public that we are following several lines of enquiry and are pleased the public are supporting us in our investigation.\n\nIt is understood that the pensioner had gone to walk his dogs alone between 9am and 11am\n\n'We have received more than 100 calls in the last three days and we would continue to urge people with information, particularly those who were in the area between 9am and 11m, to make contact.\n\n'I would like to ask again, that if you live within five miles of The Street please can you check your bins, gardens and outbuildings for any items which may have been discarded by a potential suspect.\n\n'I would also request that premises or businesses within the same area with CCTV systems preserve any footage that relate to the hours of 6am until 9pm on Saturday 5th August.\n\n'Similarly, if you have a dash-cam or other recording devices and travelled in the area, save the footage and contact the police.\n\n'We remain concerned that we have not yet been able to trace the person or people responsible for Peter's death.\n\n'I hope residents will take some reassurance from the increased policing presence today which will be continuing throughout the evening and as long as is necessary, but I am aware that this incident will be causing some to worry.\n\n'I would ask people to remain vigilant and to contact us if they see anything suspicious.'\n\nPolice are investigating the possibility that Mr Wrighton was killed after stumbling upon a drug deal, after locals suggested the wood was a hotbed for dealers", "time": "16:17:00"}

appeal to public to help solve his murder\n\nPolice have named an 83-year-old man who was stabbed to death last Saturday while walking his dogs in woods in west Norfolk.\n\nPeter Wrighton, a retired British Telecom worker from Banham who was married with two children, died of multiple stab wounds to his head and neck.\n\nHis family paid tribute to his \"kind nature\" and \"love of walking his dogs and chatting with people to pass the time of day\".\n\nIn a statement his wife of 59 years and family added: \"Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him.\"\n\nPolice have urged people in the East Harling area to search through their bins and gardens for the weapon used in what they described as a brutal attack. They have also asked local people to look out for any bloodstained clothing discarded by the suspect.\n\nNo arrests have been made since his body was found on Saturday morning in woods that are well used by hikers and cyclists and are close to a caravan and holiday park, east of Thetford.\n\nWrighton had driven there in his red Skoda Fabia to walk his two dogs: a scarteen harrier and a trailhound cross.\n\nIn a description issued by Norfolk police on Tuesday, Wrighton was described as 5ft 7in (1.70 metres) tall, white, of slim build with grey hair. He was wearing glasses, blue/grey trousers, a black T-shirt and brown walking boots.\n\nPolice have said the motive for the murder is unknown and have refused to comment on local speculation that it was connected to drug dealing known to have taken place in the woods.\n\nThe family statement added: \"We will soon be able to understand why this has happened.\n\n\"When we think of Peter we remember him with fond and happy memories that will stay with us always.\"\n\nAsked if police believe the victim knew his attacker, Norfolk's county police commander, Ch Supt Mike Fawcett said there was no information to suggest this.\n\nHe said \"This is not in the norm for Norfolk ... Norfolk remains a safe place to live and to visit.\"\n\nHe said the public could help solve the murder.\n\n\"We remain in the early stages of investigation and, whilst carrying out extensive inquiries, we believe a member of the public could hold a vital clue,\" he said.\n\n\"I would like to encourage people within a five-mile radius of The Street, which is off the A1066 and the B1111, to check their bins and gardens for any items that may have been discarded by the suspect. This could include clothing, which may be bloodstained, or a knife or other similar item which shouldn't be there.\"\n\nFawcett also appealed for anyone who has video, such as CCTV or dashcam footage, of the area on Saturday morning to save the file and contact the police.", "time": "14:33:00"}

A post-mortem revealed that the pensioner died as a result of multiple stab wounds to his neck and head.\n\nWhile no weapon has been recovered, and police have so far been unable to establish a possible motive for the killing, a witness has come forward claiming two elderly men were arguing in woods close to where Mr Wrighton's body was found.\n\nThe witness said both men were walking their dogs on Saturday morning, shortly before the retired BT engineer's body was found 50 yards from where he had parked his red Skoda Fabia at Harling Woods.\n\nThe person who discovered the body initially thought he had been attacked by his dogs Dylan and Gemma, who were found near his body.\n\nPolice are following several lines of inquiry, including the theory the pensioner was killed by someone known to him, possibly even a fellow dog walker.\n\nNorfolk's County Policing Commander, Chief Superintendent Mike Fawcett, said: \"It's unusual to have an attack where we can't show if there's any connection between the victim and the offender, and we don't know the motive for the attack.\"\n\nHe added: \"If the victim is not known to the attacker, it is really strange for somebody to just attack somebody in the open. We have somebody who is violent out there and it's somebody we need to find quick.\"\n\nHe said members of the public have come forward with information, but appealed for more help in identifying the attacker.\n\n\"I would like to reassure the public that we are following several lines of enquiry and are pleased the public are supporting us in our investigation. We have received more than 100 calls in the last three days and we would continue to urge people with information, particularly those who were in the area between 9am and 11m, to make contact.\n\n\"I would like to ask again, that if you live within five miles of The Street please can you check your bins, gardens and outbuildings for any items which may have been discarded by a potential suspect.\"\n\nPolice are also appealing for any possible witnesses who were staying at a campsite near the murder scene last weekend, to come forward.\n\n\"I would also request that premises or businesses within the same area with CCTV systems preserve any footage that relate to the hours of 6am until 9pm on Saturday 5th August. Similarly, if you have a dash-cam or other recording devices and travelled in the area, save the footage and contact the police.\n\n\"We remain concerned that we have not yet been able to trace the person or people responsible for Peter's death,\" he added. \"I hope residents will take some reassurance from the increased policing presence today which will be continuing throughout the evening and as long as is necessary, but I am aware that this incident will be causing some to worry.\"\n\nYesterday police released CCTV images of Peter in a local store four miles from the woods, at 10.12am, half an hour before he was murdered.\n\nDetectives are also investigating whether Wrighton was the victim of mistaken identity because he shares a similar name to paedophile Peter Righton, a founder member of the Paedophile Information Exchange campaign group who died in 2007 and lived just 16 miles away MSN reports.\n\nThe victim's wife of 59 years, Ann Wrighton, 76, of Banham, Norfolk, was being comforted by relatives after identifying her husband's body on Tuesday.\n\nDescribing Peter as a \"lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather\"she said in a statement: \"'Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him. We are extremely thankful for all the people who have come forward to speak with the police and hope we will soon be able to understand why this has happened. When we think of Peter we remember him with with fond and happy memories that will stay with us always.'\n\nAn inquest into the murder was briefly opened and adjourned at Norfolk coroner's court in Norwich yesterday.", "time": "22:10:00"}

He suffered multiple stab wounds to his neck and head.\n\nPolice released CCTV images of Mr Wrighton in Kenninghall Post Office four miles from the woods, at 10.12am, half an hour before he was murdered. He drove his red Skoda 4.5 miles to The Street, close to the area where he walked his dogs.\n\nAr 10.46am his body was discovered by a passerby near the Fiveways Junction. His dogs, Dylan and Gemma, were close by.\n\nOver 100 officers are investigating the murder of the grandfather, while search teams have been using metal detectors and dogs to look for evidence from the scene of the attack BBC News reports.\n\nFollowing a public appeal, 220 people called Norfolk Police with information. Earlier, a witness reported seeing two elderly men arguing in woods close to where Mr Wrighton's body was found.\n\nOn Friday, officers traced one of three \"vital\" potential witnesses - a man in his 50s who was seen changing into a T-shirt.\n\nPolice are still eager to speak to two other men. One aged 25 to 30, with tanned skin, was wearing a grey or blue t-shirt, grey gym shorts and heavy-duty flip flops. The other, aged 30 to 50, was wearing dark clothing and seen walking without a dog to the north of the heathland where Mr Wrighton had been walking.\n\nDetectives also want to speak to anyone who may have spotted a black Ford Fiesta in the area.\n\nA force spokeswoman told Sky News that despite the arrest police were \"still appealing for anyone in the area at the time to contact them\".\n\nMr Wrighton, a retired BT engineer from Banham, was married for 59 years and had two children. Paying tribute to him his wife Anne said he was a \"lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather who was immensely kind\".", "time": "18:46:00"}

three vital witnesses officers believe may have information have also been put out by the force this afternoon as the investigation continues.\n\nAround 50 police officers have been involved in the hunt for Mr Wrighton's killer - residents are being urged to check their bins for the murder weapon.\n\nThey are looking for clues which may determine how and why Mr Wrighton's body was found at 10.45am on Saturday in woodland near the Fiveways junction of the A11.\n\nA post mortem examination revealed the dog walker, whose pets Gemma and Dylan were unharmed, was stabbed in the head and neck.\n\nDetective Superintendent Andy Smith said: \"This is a complex investigation and we are pursuing many leads. As part of our comprehensive enquiries, we are now in a position to appeal directly to a number of people who may be able to provide us with information that could be vital.\"\n\nThe three vital witnesses police want to trace are:\n\n* A white man, aged over 50, of a slim build with pale skin with grey or white hair which is balding on top.\n\nIt is believed he was wearing heavy rimmed glasses and light coloured trousers.\n\nHe was seen in The Street changing into a white t-shirt.\n\n* A white man with a tanned complexion, aged around 25 to 30, between 5ft 9in and 5ft 11in tall.\n\nHe is of an athletic build with short dark wavy hair and dark eyes.\n\nIt is believed he was wearing a grey or blue t-shirt and grey floppy gym style shorts above the knee and heavy duty flip flops.\n\nHe was seen within the boundary marked on map one (above) in red.\n\n* A white man, aged from 30 to 50, of a medium build wearing dark coloured clothing. He was seen walking without a dog in the northern area of the heath.\n\nDet Supt Smith added: \"On behalf of Peter's family, we continue to ask for information.\n\n\"We want to hear from you if you are someone who knows this area or frequents it, perhaps to walk or run.\n\n\"We want to hear from you if you have seen Peter walk his dogs in that area or nearby in recent weeks or months, but especially on Saturday, August 5.\n\nHe continued: \"I have released a map of the route that Peter travelled on Saturday and an image of him on CCTV from a local shop with the hope it will jog memories.\n\n\"We want to hear from you if you know someone who has information but who is, for whatever reason, reluctant to come forward themselves.\"\n\n* VIDEO: East Harling murder - What we know so far\n\nNorfolk's county policing commander, Chief Superintendent Mike Fawcett, moved to address residents' concerns.\n\nHe said: \"A policing presence will remain in the area for the foreseeable future and I hope this provides local communities with confidence that we are here to support and protect them.\"\n\n* Anyone with information about the murder or any suspicious activity should call Norfolk Police immediately on 0800 056 0944 or 0207 158 0010, quoting Operation Graduate.", "time": "18:20:00"}

described him as \"a lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather\" who loved walking his dogs.\n\nThey thanked members of the public who have come forward with information and hope they will \"soon be able to understand why this has happened\".\n\nA statement released by police on behalf of Mr Wrighton's family paid tribute to his \"kind nature\" and his \"love of walking his dogs and chatting with people to pass the time of day\".\n\nHe had worked for British Telecom for 35 years and retired to the area 30 years ago, where he enjoyed living a simple life with his family and dogs.\n\nHis wife of 59 years and his family added: \"Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him.We are extremely thankful for all the people who have come forward to speak with the police and hope we will soon be able to understand why this has happened. When we think of Peter, we remember him with fond and happy memories that will stay with us always.\"\n\nThe hunt for the killer is ongoing following the discovery of Mr Wrighton's body on the morning of Saturday, August 5.\n\nThe death was initially treated as unexplained.\n\nBut a murder probe was launched following a post-mortem examination which revealed Mr Wrighton had died from multiple stab wounds to the neck and head.\n\nPolice, who have about 50 officers working on the case, have received more than 100 calls from the public in just a few days.\n\nYesterday they set up dedicated phone lines to take calls with information about the murder.\n\nThe phones are being manned by communications officers from Norfolk and other forces.\n\nChief Superintendent Mike Fawcett, Norfolk's county policing commander, said: \"I would like to reassure the public that we are following several lines of enquiry and are pleased the public are supporting us in our investigation.

But the shock and fear which hangs so heavily now above the devastated communities of Banham, East Harling and surrounding areas was nowhere in sight a week ago.\n\nSaturday, August 5 started out as a normal day, including for Mr Wrighton who would be heading to East Harling to walk his dogs in the expansive woodland which draws in pet-owners from across the county and beyond such is its popularity as a dog-walking destination.\n\nTragically, it was a trip from which Mr Wrighton was to never return from.\n\nThe former BT worker, who lived with his wife Ann in the picturesque village of Banham, had made the short drive from his home to the woods in his red Skoda Fabia.\n\nOn the way he had stopped off at Kenninghall Post Office, where he was picked up on CCTV buying a few items, before continuing on his journey.\n\nThose final images of Mr Wrighton while he was alive were taken between 10.08am and 10.12am.\n\nAt 10.46am Mr Wrighton's body was discovered by a member of the public with his two dogs found, unharmed, nearby.\n\nPolice were called following the find which prompted a rapid response.\n\nPeople who were working in East Harling later recalled how they thought there had been a crash after several police cars were seen and heard \"racing\" through the village in the direction of the Fiveways junction.\n\nPolice attended the scene and forensic analysis was carried out but at this stage the \"sudden death\" was being treated as \"unexplained\" with an animal attack considered as one of the possible causes.\n\nThere was still police activity at the scene on Sunday, August 6 but nothing to suggest the horrific nature of what had happened to Mr Wrighton.\n\nIt was not until after an extensive Home Office post-mortem examination, which was carried out on August 6, that police were able to reveal the victim had been subjected to a serious assault.\n\nAnd so it was that, in the early hours of Monday, August, 7, following the results of the post-mortem examination, that police officially launched a murder probe.\n\nHowever, the identity of the victim had not been made public at this point with those waking up in and around East Harling on Monday morning only aware that police were investigating the murder of a man.\n\nThe news of course caused alarm among those living in the nearby village of East Harling who were concerned not only that someone had been killed but that his killer was on the loose.\n\nThat fear however was to be heightened further following a press conference on Monday afternoon at police headquarters in Wymondham during which it emerged that an 83-year-old dog walker, a local man, had been stabbed multiple times in the neck and head.\n\nThe gruesome details sent shockwaves reverberating around the community who had never heard anything of its like before.\n\nOver the coming days the area, and surrounding villages, were flooded with police officers and local and national media all looking for answers about what had happened.\n\nThere were further press conferences on Tuesday, August 8, when police urged people to check their gardens and bins for a possible weapon and send in CCTV or dash-cam footage, which they hoped might hold vital clues.\n\nMr Wrighton was not formally identified to the public until Wednesday, August 9 - unusually a day after a description of the victim had been issued by police who said they were not then in a position to identify him.\n\nThe past week has raised a number questions, generated many theories but ultimately has yet to provide any answers.\n\nAnd that will be the biggest concern for everyone.", "time": "07:47:00"}

Harling on Saturday morning.\n\nNorfolk's senior coroner Jacqueline Lake said: \"He left his home address to take his dogs for a walk.\n\n\"He was found unresponsive by a member of the public on a footway at Harling Woods.\n\n\"Paramedics attended and Mr Wrighton was pronounced dead at the scene.\"\n\nA post-mortem examination recorded the medical cause of death as \"incised wounds to the neck\".\n\nHis body was formally identified by his wife Ann to a police officer at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital on Tuesday.\n\nThe hearing, at Norfolk Coroner's Court in Norwich, was told Mr Wrighton was a retired BT engineer and was born in Tottenham, London.\n\nThe inquest was adjourned for review on December 14 2017.\n\nNo arrests have been made since Mr Wrighton's body was found by a member of the public.\n\nMr Wrighton's family and his wife of 59 years described him as \"a lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather\".\n\nThe retired BT worker had a \"kind nature\" and had a \"love of walking his dogs and chatting with people to pass the time of day\", his family said.\n\nMurder detectives are continuing to investigate his death and believe a member of the public

week ago today, that 83-year-old Peter Wrighton was hacked to death in a crime so brutal that detectives at first assumed he had been mauled by an animal.\n\nWere fate to choose a location for the end of a good man's life in terrible circumstances, surely rural Norfolk's genteel, sunlight-dappled woodlands would not make the shortlist.\n\nFor dog-walkers such as Peter Wrighton, this idyllic spot, between East and West Harling, offered a place of sanctuary and quiet.\n\nTree-lined pathways are hidden out of sight of the country roads that pass through this remote area of eastern England. On a typical day, the silence is interrupted only by the sound of birdsong and the wind whispering through the pine and oak trees.\n\nAnd yet it was here, a week ago today, that 83-year-old Wrighton was hacked to death in a crime so brutal that detectives at first assumed he had been mauled by an animal, reports the Daily Mail.\n\nNo witnesses. No motive. Just the inexplicable murder of a much-loved father and grandfather - a mild-mannered gentleman without an enemy in the world - and a community left reeling in shock.\n\n\"This was a brutal murder with no motive,\" said Chief Superintendent Mike Fawcett of Norfolk Police. Not surprising, then, that those who regularly walk their dogs along the same footpath that Wrighton followed last Saturday at around 10.30am, are afraid to return while his killer remains on the loose.\n\nHarling parish councillor Colin Forder said: I have two children and we often take the dog for a walk in the woods, so it's worrying.\"\n\nHis colleague, parish council vice-chair Elizabeth Mould, added: \"I was there on my own last Friday, and there are quite a few ladies who also go alone. It's very unusual and scary what's happened.\"\n\nAnother dog walker, who asked not to be named, said the area had been \"blighted\" by the murder.\n\n\"We all feel unsafe knowing there is a killer on the loose,\" he added. \"My wife is afraid to go out with our dog on her own.\"\n\nLocals with longer memories, meanwhile, point out that this is not the first time the area has been the setting of a vicious, unsolved crime.\n\nScratch even deeper, and it appears this seemingly anonymous and urbane corner of England - specifically West Harling wood - has been fate's place of choice for some truly horrible goings-on.\n\nTake the fact that the attack on Wrighton was carried out just a stone's throw from where a 71-year-old pensioner was raped while walking her dog on June 7, 1994.\n\nWhile the crimes are unlikely to be linked, it seems curious that two examples of such brutality should occur in such a tiny pinprick of a map reference.\n\nThe woman had been walking her West Highland terrier in an area known as The Gallops, which once led to Berdewell Hall, a grand, castellated and moated house that was demolished in 1725.\n\nShe was approached by a youth who dragged her into the hedgerow and carried out a vicious, 20-minute sex attack, during which he attempted to strangle her before leaving her almost naked among stinging nettles, badly bruised and beaten. The perpetrator also attacked her dog before fleeing on a dark-coloured bicycle.\n\nThis unsolved crime is the subject of an ongoing cold case review and was featured ten years ago on the ITV crime programme Reward: Catching The Criminals.\n\nWhile detectives managed to obtain a complete DNA profile of the rapist - described as being tall and about 16 years old with dark brown hair shaved at the sides and straggly on top - they have never managed to track him down, despite the offer of a \u00a310,000 (NZ$17,775) reward.\n\nThe woman moved from the area shortly afterwards, and it's not known if she is still alive.\n\nIn the ensuing 23 years, the sleepy Norfolk village, which had just over 2,000 inhabitants at the 2011 census, has lost much of its innocence.\n\nWhile residents have reported what they believe to be drug deals going on in the secluded woods, there have been complaints, too, of men of Eastern European appearance camping out in the area where Wrighton was walking.\n\nDog-owner Terry Ransom, 73, from nearby Attleborough, who used to walk the same path as Wrighton almost every day, said he had taken to carrying a stick since noticing suspicious behaviour in the area.\n\n\"There were two people hiding things in the wood about a month ago,\" he said.\n\n\"One was keeping watch and the other one was in and out, and then they swapped around and they were in there for 40 minutes with their car door open.\n\n\"Two days later, I was just coming back on the pathway and there was a young boy. He pulled up on his mountain bike, did a wheelie and flung his bike down. Then he was feeling about, picked up a package, smelt it and put it in his jacket.\n\n\"I would suggest that it is a well-known drugs exchange area. I cannot see why a random attacker would attack an 83-year-old unless it's to do with drugs.\"\n\nOnly five years ago, the village made national news again when the 52-year-old owner of a pig farm - again, close to where Wrighton's body was found - died suddenly while being investigated by the RSPCA over allegations of cruelty.\n\nStephen Brown died suddenly after an animal rights group, Animal Equality, filmed workers at Harling Farm - which had previously been approved by the Red Tractor food quality assurance scheme - beating pigs with iron bars.\n\nA completely unrelated crime, but shocking in its brutality.\n\nTurn the clock back even further and the same farm was the scene of tragedy in 1945, when a US Air Force Liberator aircraft, which had been converted into a flying fuel transporter, crashed into a barn shortly after take-off from nearby RAF base Snetterton Heath.\n\nThe barn was rebuilt in 1948 and a plaque marks the spot where everyone on board was killed.\n\nNow, as police try to track down Wrighton's cold-blooded killer, it seems the peace and isolation so loved by walkers has been shattered again. The remoteness of the scene is also hampering the evidence-gathering by police.\n\nThere are no houses near the place where he was killed - only the pig farm, the remains of a Viking burial site and, further down the road, a private preparatory boarding school, Riddlesworth Hall, which was once attended by Princess Diana.\n\nWith no other walkers within sight or earshot at the time of the crime, the perpetrator appears to have been able to slip away unseen.\n\nNorfolk police insist there was no obvious motive for Wrighton's killing. Nothing was stolen; his dogs - a nine-year-old Scarteen harrier named Dylan and a 13-year-old trailhound cross, Gemma - were found unharmed, waiting faithfully by their master's body.\n\nWrighton had been happily married to his wife, Ann, for 59 years and the devoted couple, who lived seven miles from the murder scene in the village of Banham, doted on their two grown-up children, Andrew and Carol, and their families.\n\nAbove all, Wrighton was regarded as a popular, kind-hearted member of the community - certainly not the kind of man to have harboured secrets or, had he witnessed any wrongdoing, to have confronted or picked a fight with a stranger.\n\nNorfolk police insist there was no obvious motive for Wrighton's killing.

They regularly made donations to the food bank organised by the village church, St Mary The Virgin.\n\nCanon Stephen Wright, the church's vicar, said he had visited the grieving family to offer his condolences. \"It's obvious he stumbled into someone or something going on,\" he said.\n\n\"No one knows, and the most difficult thing is not knowing.\n\n\"People are feeling they have to lock up more than usual, and they feel worried about taking their dogs for a walk in a remote place.\"\n\nNearby residents have told how the Wrightons were active in many aspects of local life.\n\nRetired bookkeeper Mrs Wrighton is a former secretary of the Rex Cats Society, and both she and her husband were long-term committee members at Thetford and District Canine Society.\n\nThey were due to attend the group's annual show tomorrow, an event they helped to organise.\n\nNow, instead, a minute's silence will be held in Wrighton's memory. The society's treasurer, Marilyn Clark, said this week: \"We cannot believe this could happen to such a wonderful man.\n\n\"He was a lovely, gentle, kind person. We're just shell-shocked. Our hearts go out to Ann. Why someone would do that to such a nice person, I do not know.\"\n\nPolice officers appear to be finding the investigation into this \"out of the ordinary\" murder equally challenging.\n\nOver the past few days, torrential rain has fallen relentlessly across the area, further diminishing the chances of discovering any lingering clues that might help detectives solve the crime. With no obvious leads to find out the identity of the killer, all they can say is that whoever is responsible would have been drenched with Wrighton's blood.\n\nThen there is the missing murder weapon. Police are remaining tight-lipped about what object was used to kill Wrighton, but they have asked those living within a five-mile radius of The Street, a Roman road which runs parallel to the path where Wrighton's body was found, to search their dustbins, garden sheds and outbuildings in case the killer disposed of it while fleeing from the scene.\n\nAround 400 items have been handed in already.\n\nBut above all, detectives working on what they have dubbed Operation Graduate are mindful that random, motiveless murders, where victim and killer are not known to each other, are rare.\n\nWrighton and his two dogs had set off towards East Harling last Saturday morning in his red Skoda Fabia, stopping off briefly at the Post Office during the seven-mile journey, where he was captured on CCTV just after 10am, dressed in a black T-shirt and trousers.\n\nHe was killed around 30 minutes later, just moments after parking his car and setting off on his walk.\n\nNorfolk police say they are examining several potential motives, including the possibility that Wrighton was embroiled in a \"dog rage\" incident with another owner. One witness who came forward this week apparently told police he saw two elderly men involved in a heated discussion in the wood on Saturday morning.\n\nDetectives have also appealed for three men who were in the area at the time - but who were not seen together - to come forward.\n\nThe first was believed to have changed into a white T-shirt on the road where Wrighton parked his car.\n\nHe was described as being over 50 and wearing light-coloured trousers and heavy-rimmed glasses. Yesterday, police said they had located him and would be interviewing him in due course.\n\nThe second man was aged 25-30, with a tanned complexion, an athletic build, between 5ft 9in and 5ft 11in tall and believed to have been wearing a blue or grey T-shirt, gym-style shorts and flip-flops.\n\nThe third man was aged between 30 and 50, of medium build and wearing dark-coloured clothing. He was seen in the northern area of the heathland without a dog.\n\nOfficers are also trying to track down guests who were staying at an upmarket \"glamping\" campsite less than two miles from the murder scene.\n\nThey say that they have heard from 220 potential witnesses so far, and are using metal detectors and dogs over a \"considerable area\" in their search for clues to this terrible crime.\n\nMeanwhile, the shadow that has been cast over this tranquil village will inevitably remain until the killer is found, with everyone left wondering what else fate might have in store.", "time": "09:33:00"}

laterInvalid Email\n\nIt is almost a week since grandfather Peter Wrighton was brutally murdered while walking his dogs in woodland near his home.\n\nThe 83-year-old's killing has rocked the picturesque village of East Harling in Norfolk where he was described as \"lovely, gentle\" man.\n\nMr Wrighton, a retired BT engineer, suffered repeated \"incise\" wounds and was found with his two loyal dogs Dylan and Gemma waiting beside his body last Saturday.\n\nDetectives are playing catch up on the case - in part because the fellow walker who found Mr Wrighton, believed he may have suffered a dog attack.\n\nNo weapon was found nearby, and it was another 48 hours before Norfolk Police announced a murder investigation was underway on Monday morning.\n\nNo arrests have been made and police are still clueless as to who killed Mr Wrighton and why.\n\nHowever, a number of theories have emerged based on evidence discovered so far:\n\n1. Argument with a fellow dog walker\n\nLast night, it emerged a witness has come forward to say he saw two elderly men arguing in Harling Woods shortly before the murder.\n\nThe witness said he saw the two men in a heated discussion on Saturday morning.\n\nPolice released CCTV images of Mr Wrighton in a local shop four miles from the woods, at 10.12am, half an hour before he was killed.\n\nHis body was found at 10.45am.\n\n2. Local drug dealers\n\nFellow dog walkers said the woodland, situated next to a pig farm, is a favourite haunt of local drug dealers.\n\nAnother pet owner said he had been left uneasy by a strange man staring at him at the spot where the pensioner was killed.\n\n\"I would suggest that this area is a well known drugs exchange area,\" he told the Diss Express.\n\n\"I cannot see why a random attacker would attack an 83-year-old unless it's for drugs.\"\n\nThe local described recently seeing a young man picking up a hidden package and smelling it near the woods.\n\nHe added: \"Once there was a chap in there, he was about 22 or 23 and he was just staring at me, what he was in there for I don't know but we do see a lot of people in there.\"\n\nHowever, detectives are said to have ruled out robbery as a motive.\n\n3. A nearby campsite\n\nPolice are also tracing people who stayed at a campsite near the murder scene last weekend.\n\nDetective Andy Smith, who is leading the investigation, wants to speak to three men spotted near the murder scene who may be able to provide \"vital\" information:\n\nWhite man, aged over 50, of a slim build with pale skin with grey or white hair which is balding on top. It is believed he was wearing heavy rimmed glasses and light coloured trousers. He was seen in changing into a white t-shirt nearby. White man with a tanned complexion, aged 25-30 years, between 5'9'' and 5'11'' tall. He is of an athletic build with short dark wavy hair and dark eyes. It is believed he was wearing a grey or blue t-shirt and grey floppy gym style shorts above the knee and heavy duty flip flops. He was seen within the boundary of the murder scene.\n\nWhite man, aged 30 to 50 years old, of a medium build wearing dark coloured clothing. He was seen walking without a dog in the northern area of the heath.\n\n4. Was Mr Wrighton mistaken for a local paedophile?\n\nDetectives are also probing whether Mr Wrighton was the victim of mistaken identity because he shares a similar name to paedophile Peter Righton, a founder member of the Paedophile Information Exchange campaign group who died in 2007 and lived just 16 miles away.\n\n5. Rapist who attacked pensioner in same woods 23 years ago\n\nIt emerged on Tuesday that an elderly female dog walker was attacked at almost exactly the same spot as Mr Wrighton died decades ago.\n\nThe victim was raped and left for dead in West Harling Heath in 1994 and her teenage attacker has never been caught.\n\nThe sickening attack was featured in an ITV crime series in 2007 and remains an active cold-case for Norfolk Police.\n\nThe force said it is looking to see whether the two cases are linked.\n\n'We want to hear from you'\n\nDet Supt Smith added: \"On behalf of Peter's family, we continue to ask for information.\n\n\"We want to hear from you if you are someone who knows this area or frequents it, perhaps to walk or run.\n\n\"We want to hear from you if you know someone who has information but who is, for whatever reason, reluctant to come forward themselves.\n\n\"I am extremely grateful to those persons who have already engaged with us and provided valuable information.\n\n\"I would like to reassure those still thinking of coming forward that, if required, we are able to treat your information in confidence.\n\n\"We want to piece together Peter's final days so that we can understand what happened to him and why.\n\n\"We know that Peter's family and the people of the local area want to understand and we want to help them to do that.\"\n\nAn inquest was briefly opened and adjourned at Norfolk coroner's court in Norwich yesterday.\n\nMr Wrighton's distraught wife Ann, 76, of Banham, Norfolk, was being comforted by relatives after identifying her husband's body on Tuesday.\n\nShe said Peter, originally from North London, who volunteered for the Dogs Trust, was a \"lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather\".", "time": "03:52:00"}

man's life in terrible circumstances, surely rural Norfolk's genteel, sunlight-dappled woodlands would not make the shortlist.\n\nFor dog-walkers such as Peter Wrighton, this idyllic spot, between East and West Harling, offered a place of sanctuary and quiet.\n\nTree-lined pathways are hidden out of sight of the country roads that pass through this remote area of eastern England. On a typical day, the silence is interrupted only by the sound of birdsong and the wind whispering through the pine and oak trees.\n\nAnd yet it was here, a week ago today, that 83-year-old Mr Wrighton was hacked to death in a crime so brutal that detectives at first assumed he had been mauled by an animal.\n\nMr Wrighton was hacked to death in a crime so brutal that detectives at first assumed he had been mauled by an animal\n\nNo witnesses. No motive. Just the inexplicable murder of a much-loved father and grandfather -- a mild-mannered gentleman without an enemy in the world -- and a community left reeling in shock.\n\n'This was a brutal murder with no motive,' said Chief Superintendent Mike Fawcett of Norfolk Police. Not surprising, then, that those who regularly walk their dogs along the same footpath that Mr Wrighton followed last Saturday at around 10.30am, are afraid to return while his killer remains on the loose.\n\nHarling parish councillor Colin Forder said: 'I have two children and we often take the dog for a walk in the woods, so it's worrying.'\n\nHis colleague, parish council vice-chair Elizabeth Mould, added: 'I was there on my own last Friday, and there are quite a few ladies who also go alone. It's very unusual and scary what's happened.'\n\nThe pensioner was a much-loved father and grandfather -- a mild-mannered gentleman without an enemy in the world -- and a community left reeling in shock\n\nAnother dog walker, who asked not to be named, said the area had been 'blighted' by the murder.\n\n'We all feel unsafe knowing there is a killer on the loose,' he added. 'My wife is afraid to go out with our dog on her own.'\n\nLocals with longer memories, meanwhile, point out that this is not the first time the area has been the setting of a vicious, unsolved crime.\n\nScratch even deeper, and it appears this seemingly anonymous and urbane corner of England -- specifically West Harling wood -- has been fate's place of choice for some truly horrible goings-on.\n\nPolice at the scene near where an 83-year-old man was found dead at woods near East Harling\n\nTake the fact that the attack on Mr Wrighton was carried out just a stone's throw from where a 71-year-old pensioner was raped while walking her dog on June 7, 1994.\n\nWhile the crimes are unlikely to be linked, it seems curious that two examples of such brutality should occur in such a tiny pinprick of a map reference.\n\nThe woman had been walking her West Highland terrier in an area known as The Gallops, which once led to Berdewell Hall, a grand, castellated and moated house that was demolished in 1725.\n\nShe was approached by a youth who dragged her into the hedgerow and carried out a vicious, 20-minute sex attack, during which he attempted to strangle her before leaving her almost naked among stinging nettles, badly bruised and beaten. The perpetrator also attacked her dog before fleeing on a dark-coloured bicycle.\n\nIt is understood that the pensioner had gone to walk his dogs alone between 9am and 11am. While the crimes are unlikely to be linked, it seems curious that two examples of such brutality should occur in such a tiny pinprick of a map reference\n\nThis unsolved crime is the subject of an ongoing cold case review and was featured ten years ago on the ITV crime programme Reward: Catching The Criminals.\n\nWhile detectives managed to obtain a complete DNA profile of the rapist -- described as being tall and about 16 years old with dark brown hair shaved at the sides and straggly on top -- they have never managed to track him down, despite the offer of a \u00a310,000 reward.\n\nThe woman moved from the area shortly afterwards, and it's not known if she is still alive.\n\nThe pensioner died after he was repeatedly stabbed in the head and neck in Norfolk. It came after a pensioner was raped by a young man in 1994 but detectives have never managed to track him down, despite the offer of a \u00a310,000 reward.\n\nThe man had been in a popular area of woods bordering heathland near East Harling, Norfolk. In the year's after the rape, the village, which had just over 2,000 inhabitants at the 2011 census, has lost much of its innocence\n\nIn the ensuing 23 years, the sleepy Norfolk village, which had just over 2,000 inhabitants at the 2011 census, has lost much of its innocence.\n\nWhile residents have reported what they believe to be drug deals going on in the secluded woods, there have been complaints, too, of men of Eastern European appearance camping out in the area where Mr Wrighton was walking.\n\nDog-owner Terry Ransom, 73, from nearby Attleborough, who used to walk the same path as Mr Wrighton almost every day, said he had taken to carrying a stick since noticing suspicious behaviour in the area.\n\nPolice have admitted the motive for the killing of the married father-of-two remains unclear. Dog-owner Terry Ransom, 73: 'I would suggest that it is a well-known drugs exchange area'\n\n'There were two people hiding things in the wood about a month ago,' he said. 'One was keeping watch and the other one was in and out, and then they swapped around and they were in there for 40 minutes with their car door open.\n\n'Two days later, I was just coming back on the pathway and there was a young boy. He pulled up on his mountain bike, did a wheelie and flung his bike down. Then he was feeling about, picked up a package, smelt it and put it in his jacket.\n\n'I would suggest that it is a well-known drugs exchange area. I cannot see why a random attacker would attack an 83-year-old unless it's to do with drugs.'\n\nOnly five years ago, the village made national news again when the 52-year-old owner of a pig farm -- again, close to where Mr Wrighton's body was found -- shot himself in the head with a rifle while being investigated by the RSPCA over allegations of cruelty.\n\nStephen Brown took his own life after an animal rights group, Animal Equality, filmed workers at Harling Farm -- which had previously been approved by the Red Tractor food quality assurance scheme -- beating pigs with iron bars.\n\nA completely unrelated crime, but shocking in its brutality.\n\nTurn the clock back even further and the same farm was the scene of tragedy in 1945, when a U.S. Air Force Liberator aircraft, which had been converted into a flying fuel transporter, crashed into a barn shortly after take-off from nearby RAF base Snetterton Heath.\n\nThe man who died in Norfolk was said to have been a 'well liked member of the community'\n\nThe barn was rebuilt in 1948 and a plaque marks the spot where everyone on board was killed.\n\nNow, as police try to track down Mr Wrighton's cold-blooded killer, it seems the peace and isolation so loved by walkers has been shattered again. The remoteness of the scene is also hampering the evidence-gathering by police.\n\nThere are no houses near the place where he was killed -- only the pig farm, the remains of a Viking burial site and, further down the road, a private preparatory boarding school, Riddlesworth Hall, which was once attended by Princess Diana.\n\nWith no other walkers within sight or earshot at the time of the crime, the perpetrator appears to have been able to slip away unseen.\n\nThe man was found by another dog walker on Saturday, who also found his two pets unharmed\n\nThe murder has rocked the small community and residents have been left concerned\n\nNorfolk police insist there was no obvious motive for Mr Wrighton's killing. Nothing was stolen; his dogs -- a nine-year-old Scarteen harrier named Dylan and a 13-year-old trailhound cross, Gemma -- were found unharmed, waiting faithfully by their master's body.\n\nMr Wrighton had been happily married to his wife, Ann, for 59 years and the devoted couple, who lived seven miles from the murder scene in the village of Banham, doted on their two grown-up children, Andrew and Carol, and their families.\n\nAbove all, Mr Wrighton was regarded as a popular, kind-hearted member of the community -- certainly not the kind of man to have harboured secrets or, had he witnessed any wrongdoing, to have confronted or picked a fight with a stranger.\n\nThe man died as a result of 'multiple stab wounds to his head and neck', a post mortem found\n\nIt is impossible to imagine why anyone would have wanted to kill this straightforward, family-loving man, who spent his working life as an engineer for what was the General Post Office and then BT, before retiring to Norfolk from East London nearly 30 years ago.\n\nHe and his wife were known locally for their love of animals, as well as their charitable spirit. They regularly made donations to the food bank organised by the village church, St Mary The Virgin.\n\nCanon Stephen Wright, the church's vicar, said he had visited the grieving family to offer his condolences. 'It's obvious he stumbled into someone or something going on,' he said. 'No one knows, and the most difficult thing is not knowing.\n\n'People are feeling they have to lock up more than usual, and they feel worried about taking their dogs for a walk in a remote place.'\n\nThe man was 'a local, married man who was a well-liked member of the community', police said\n\nNearby residents have told how the Wrightons were active in many aspects of local life. Retired bookkeeper Mrs Wrighton is a former secretary of the Rex Cats Society, and both she and her husband were long-term committee members at Thetford and District Canine Society.\n\nThey were due to attend the group's annual show tomorrow, an event they helped to organise.\n\nNow, instead, a minute's silence will be held in Mr Wrighton's memory. The society's treasurer, Marilyn Clark, told the Mail this week: 'We cannot believe this could happen to such a wonderful man.\n\n'He was a lovely, gentle, kind person. We're just shell-shocked. Our hearts go out to Ann. Why someone would do that to such a nice person, I do not know.'\n\nThe woodland in Norfolk is managed by the Forestry Commission and borders a field of pigs\n\nPolice officers appear to be finding the investigation into this 'out of the ordinary' murder equally challenging.\n\nOver the past few days, torrential rain has fallen relentlessly across the area, further diminishing the chances of discovering any lingering clues that might help detectives solve the crime. With no obvious leads to find out the identity of the killer, all they can say is that whoever is responsible would have been drenched with Mr Wrighton's blood.\n\nThen there is the missing murder weapon. Police are remaining tight-lipped about what object was used to kill Mr Wrighton, but they have asked those living within a five-mile radius of The Street, a Roman road which runs parallel to the path where Mr Wrighton's body was found, to search their dustbins, garden sheds and outbuildings in case the killer disposed of it while fleeing from the scene.\n\nAround 400 items have been handed in already.\n\nBut above all, detectives working on what they have dubbed Operation Graduate are mindful that random, motiveless murders, where victim and killer are not known to each other, are rare.\n\nMr Wrighton and his two dogs had set off towards East Harling last Saturday morning in his red Skoda Fabia, stopping off briefly at the Post Office during the seven-mile journey, where he was captured on CCTV just after 10am, dressed in a black T-shirt and trousers.\n\nHe was killed around 30 minutes later, just moments after parking his car and setting off on his walk.\n\nThe area which borders a field full of pigs was cordoned off by police as officers stood guard\n\nNorfolk police say they are examining several potential motives, including the possibility that Mr Wrighton was embroiled in a 'dog rage' incident with another owner. One witness who came forward this week apparently told police he saw two elderly men involved in a heated discussion in the wood on Saturday morning.\n\nDetectives have also appealed for three men who were in the area at the time -- but who were not seen together -- to come forward.\n\nThe first was believed to have changed into a white T-shirt on the road where Mr Wrighton parked his car.\n\nHe was described as being over 50 and wearing light-coloured trousers and heavy-rimmed glasses. Yesterday, police said they had located him and would be interviewing him in due course.\n\nThe second man was aged 25-30, with a tanned complexion, an athletic build, between 5ft 9in and 5ft 11in tall and believed to have been wearing a blue or grey T-shirt, gym-style shorts and flip-flops.\n\nThe third man was aged between 30 and 50, of medium build and wearing dark-coloured clothing. He was seen in the northern area of the heathland without a dog.\n\nOfficers are also trying to track down guests who were staying at an upmarket 'glamping' campsite less than two miles from the murder scene.\n\nThey say that they have heard from 220 potential witnesses so far, and are using metal detectors and dogs over a 'considerable area' in their search for clues to this terrible crime.\n\nMeanwhile, the shadow that has been cast over this tranquil village will inevitably remain until the killer is found, with everyone left wondering what else fate might have in store.", "time": "22:13:00"}

He used to donate to the foodbank at the church.

I don't think he had the sort of mind where he would be expecting a horrible thing to happen.\n\n\"He wouldn't have had a grievance with anyone or anything, that's for certain. He was totally inoffensive. He wasn't an argumentative sort of man.\n\n\"I was absolutely horrified before they even released his name.

I've never had any feelings that this is a dangerous place to live. It makes you think twice about going out in the dark.\n\n\"These sort of crimes happen in the ghettos in the city. This shows it can happen anywhere.\"\n\nOf the media circus in the area at the moment, she said: \"We welcome anything that's going to help resolve it and find the perpetrator.\n\n\"If the interest and presence is there to try and find out more and trigger people's memories, it can't be a bad thing.

who was stabbed to death while walking his dogs have arrested a man in his 20s on suspicion of murder.\n\nPeter Wrighton, 83, was found in heavy undergrowth in woods near the village of East Harling, Norfolk, last Saturday with his loyal pets by his side.\n\nNorfolk Police said the suspect is from the local area and has been arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nOfficers detained the suspect this morning and he is being held in custody.\n\nA post-mortem examination by the Home Office found that Mr Wrighton, from Banham, died of wounds to his head and neck.\n\nDetectives investigating the \"horrendous\" murder said they would re-close The Street, close to where Mr Wrighton was found, later today for \"operational reasons\".\n\nMr Wrigthton, a retired BT engineer, was found by a passer-by among thick nettles and undergrowth who noticed his dogs standing guard over him.\n\nHis death was initially treated as unexplained with an \"animal attack\" considered as one of the possible explanations.\n\nDetectives were understood to be investigating whether Mr Wrighton had a row with another man moments before he was killed.\n\nThey confirmed a witness reported hearing two elderly men having a bust-up in the woods around the time the pensioner was murdered.\n\nYesterday CCTV footage of the victim was revealed showing him purchasing items in a Post Office half an hour before his body was found.\n\nEarlier in the week, Mr Wrighton's family paid tribute to him, describing him as a \"lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather\".\n\nThey told how he had a \"kind nature\" and talked of his \"love of walking his dogs and chatting with people to pass the time of day\".\n\nAnn, to whom Mr Wrighton was married to for 59 years, said: \"Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him.\n\n\"We are extremely thankful for all the people who have come forward to speak with the police and hope we will soon be able to understand why this has happened.\n\n\"When we think of Peter we remember him with with fond and happy memories that will stay with us always.\"\n\nDetectives are trying to trace three men they believe may be able to assist them with the investigation.\n\nThe first is a white male, aged over 50, of slim build with pale skin, heavy dimmed glasses and white coloured trousers.\n\nThe second is a white tanned male, between 5'9 and 5'11 tall, of athletic build, with short dark wavy hair, dark eyes and heavy duty flip flops.\n\nThe third is a white male, of medium build, who was wearing dark coloured clothing.\n\nMore than 100 officers are working on catching Mr Wrighton's killer and a dedicated phone line has been set up to deal with calls from members of the public who may have information which could help.\n\nAnyone with any information should call The Operation Graduate helplines on 0800 056 0944 or 0207 158 0010.\n\nFor the latest news on this story

week after Peter Wrighton was found stabbed to death near East Harling, Norfolk.\n\nPeter, described as a gentle husband, dad and grandfather, had been stabbed in the head and neck while walking his two dogs near East Harling, Norfolk.\n\nThe victim, from Banham, Norfolk, was found by another dog owner, 50 yards from where he had parked his red Skoda Fabia at Harling Woods.\n\nHis dogs, Dylan and Gemma, were found near his body.\n\nThe person who discovered Peter initially thought he had been attacked by his dogs.\n\nParamedics raced to the wood, but the retired BT engineer was declared dead at the scene.\n\nHis nine-year-old Scarteen Harrier and 13-year-old Trailhound cross, were found unharmed near the pensioner's body.\n\nA manhunt, involving more than 100 officers was launched on Sunday night after a pathologist ruled Peter had died from \"incised\" wounds.\n\nHis distraught wife Ann, 76, of Banham, Norfolk, was being comforted by relatives after identifying her husband's body on Tuesday.\n\nShe said Peter, originally from North London, who volunteered for the Dogs Trust, was a \"lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather\".\n\nHis family also paid tribute to the 83-year-old's \"kind nature\" and his \"love of walking his dogs and chatting with people to pass the time of day\".\n\nPeter had worked for British Telecom for 35 years and retired to the area 30 years ago where he enjoyed living a simple life with his family.\n\nHe had been married for 59 years.\n\nA family spokesman said: \"Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him.\n\n\"We are extremely thankful for all the people who have come forward to speak with the police and hope we will soon be able to understand why this has happened.\n\n\"When we think of Peter we remember him with with fond and happy memories that will stay with us always.\"\n\nEnquiries are continuing regarding the incident and detectives ask that anyone with information should contact Norfolk Police immediately on on 0800 056 0944 or 0207 158 0010, quoting Operation Graduate, visit the mobile police station or alternatively contact

almost a week since the body of Mr Wrighton from Banham was found in woodland close to the Fiveways junction near East Harling.\n\nThe case has attracted huge publicity but no arrests have yet been made.\n\nThe death had been treated as unexplained with an \"animal attack\" considered as one of the possible explanations.\n\nA murder investigation was launched on Monday, August 7 after a Home Office post-mortem examination revealed Mr Wrighton had been stabbed multiple times in the neck and head.\n\nLorne Green, Norfolk's police and crime commissioner, was asked about the delay in launching a murder probe and not publicly naming Mr Wrighton until Wednesday.\n\nPolice had said identification comes under the coroner's jurisdiction but permission had been given early as this would usually take place at the inquest which opened on Thursday.\n\nMr Green said he had been in \"close communication\" with the force and insisted he was \"satisfied\" the constabulary had acted appropriately.\n\nHe said: \"This tragic case is so rare to be practically unknown in our generally safe and peaceful county.\n\n\"Our first thoughts of course must be with the victim and the surrounding community.\n\n\"It's owing to all of Norfolk that the constabulary make every effort in tracking down the perpetrator of this horrendous crime and resources will not be an inhibiting factor in investigating this crime and bringing the perpetrators to justice.\"\n\nHe added: \"I do have a duty to the Norfolk community to hold the police to account.\n\n\"I will continue to seek to be updated as the investigation proceeds and I will be reviewing all these matters further with the chief constable as part of my duty to hold the constabulary to account.\n\n\"I personally am satisfied that the necessary procedures have been and are being followed and that this investigation is proceeding in a professional and intensive way.\"", "time": "13:11:00"}

were arguing in woods where 83-year-old Peter Wrighton's body was found, says a witness.\n\nPeter, described as a gentle husband, dad and grandfather , was stabbed in the head and neck while walking his two dogs near East Harling, Norfolk.\n\nThe sighting is understood to have taken place on Saturday morning, shortly before the killing. The witness said both men were walking their dogs.\n\nThe victim was found by another dog owner, 50 yards from where he had parked his red Skoda Fabia at Harling Woods. His dogs, Dylan and Gemma, were found near his body.\n\nThe person who discovered Peter initially thought he had been attacked by his dogs. Paramedics raced to the wood, but the retired BT engineer was declared dead at the scene.\n\nA manhunt, involving more than 100 officers was launched on Sunday night after a pathologist ruled Peter had died from \"incised\" wounds to the neck.\n\nPolice yesterday released CCTV images of Peter in a local store four miles from the woods, at 10.12am, half an hour before he was murdered.\n\nDet Supt Andy Smith said police were following several lines of inquiry, including the theory the pensioner was killed by someone known to him, possibly even a fellow dog walker.\n\nDetectives, who have ruled out robbery, are also probing whether he was the victim of mistaken identity because he shares a similar name to paedophile Peter Righton, a founder member of the Paedophile Information Exchange campaign group who died in 2007 and lived just 16 miles away.\n\nPolice are also tracing people who stayed at a campsite near the murder scene last weekend.\n\nDet Supt Smith said: \"It's a huge, challenging investigation. He was subjected to a particularly brutal attack.\"\n\nAn inquest was briefly opened and adjourned at Norfolk coroner's court in Norwich yesterday.\n\nHis distraught wife Ann, 76, of Banham, Norfolk, was being comforted by relatives after identifying her husband's body on Tuesday.\n\nShe said Peter, originally from North London, who volunteered for the Dogs Trust, was a \"lovely, gentle husband, dad and grandfather\".", "time": "23:32:00"}

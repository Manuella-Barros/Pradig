crashed into a shop sparking a major rescue operation after the driver allegedly blacked out at the wheel\n\nThe driver allegedly told passengers he had lost consciousness before the crash at about 7am, and emergency services said a total of ten patients had been treated.\n\nParamedics said two of these people were taken as a 'priority' to hospital in a stable condition, while another with minor injuries was also taken there for treatment.\n\nAbout a dozen passengers were on the bus at the time of the crash, and witnesses saw smoke coming from underneath - leading to fears that it might have

trapped on the top deck of the bus, adding that the passengers were 'both conscious and breathing'.\n\nOfficers were called just before 7am today to reports of a bus hitting a building on Lavender Hill, in an accident that sparked morning rush hour chaos.\n\nAndrew Matthews, 34, of Wandsworth Town, said he was one of around a dozen passengers on the bus, adding: 'I was on the top floor at the back, fortunately.\n\n'I noticed the bus drifting. I heard a smash and saw the roof of the shop going through (the bus) from the front left. It went to the fourth or fifth row.\n\n'I wedged myself in, bracing myself.

I looked up. I realised we were crashing. It was all happening in slow motion, it was very surreal.\n\n'I braced myself, thinking 'oh my God, I am going to die'.

About a quarter of the bus was in the building. If that had been a stone shop, like bricks, it would have been a problem.\n\n'But because it was glass, it gave way. And that's why those two people at the front of the bus, on the top deck, are still alive. All I remember is a really sharp turning and thinking, what's going on?'\n\nShe added: 'I could see it all happening. I didn't run towards the bus driver because people were going that way.\n\n'People were getting off the bus, there was a lot of commotion. My thinking was, I need to get up the stairs.\n\n'I went on the top of the stairs. There was a lady up there. I have got her blood all over me. She was bad. She was crushed to about her waist.\n\n'I couldn't see her legs - the bus was crushed in. I was with her, and she gave me her phone. There was a guy there.

She was in her 40s. She was quite badly injured, there was blood everywhere. She was conscious. She was panicking.\n\n'I can't remember her name. She was blonde, her hair was shoulder length.\n\n'I would have stayed with her regardless, but someone was shouting 'fire', and I could smell smoke. I could see smoke coming out underneath.\n\n'I started asking her questions about could she feel, was she in pain. I was trying to calm her down. And then someone said there is a fire on the bus, and took my hand and pulled me downstairs.\n\n'I saw them go towards the front, to the driver. We bashed the door in and pulled him out. He was conscious at that point.\n\n'And we took him to the side, and we pulled someone else out. He was in his 40s or 50s. He passed out. We think we had a fit.\n\n'He has gone to hospital, and so have the other two ladies. My speculation is he had a fit.

He got the biggest shock when he woke up. When people went over to him they thought he was dead because his eyes were rolled back in his head.\n\n'Someone told me that but I didn't see that. When I saw him he was dazed, and we pulled him out. We were helping to pull people out.\n\n'I didn't see the other victim, but apparently she had ducked under the seat, so that saved her life. Someone said they had to pull her out from underneath the seat. They were both right at the front.'\n\nShe added: 'I am pretty shaken up. I managed to crack my knee coming off the bus, so I am a bit sore. My blood pressure is through the roof. I am in shock. I was really impressed with the ambulance service, with the police.\n\n'People were breaking down the door to get people out. And people were offering us drinks and blankets. It's really amazing to see how people pull together, strangers, and the camaraderie.'\n\nWitnesses reported seeing smoke coming from under the bus. Solange Morin, 33, lives close to the scene and was hoping to catch the bus before she saw it crash.\n\nShe said: 'I saw this woman shouting and banging on the glass. Everybody shouted 'fire, fire'. I went on to the bus. I talked to her and was holding her hands.\n\n'She was pinned. I wouldn't have been able to get her out. She was so scared because people were shouting fire.

Fire and police department came very quick.\n\n'There was six people up the top and they were all helping each other.

But I suppose life is so much more important than a couple of customers. I hope everything gets cleared up soon, and everyone is okay.\n\n'The top of the bus looks really mangled.

Photographs showed the double-decker bus embedded in the side of a shop on Lavender Hill, near Clapham Junction station in Battersea. One passenger reported that the driver said he had \"blacked out\" before the collision. Another witness said he saw a trapped woman screaming and \"a lot of blood\" as smoke emerged from underneath the vehicle.\n\nThe bus mounted the pavement and hit the Poggenpohl Kitchen Design Centre, which was closed at the time, at about 7am on Thursday. Passengers described how a section of the shop's awning had pierced the front windows on the upper deck of the bus. Police cordoned off the scene and advised commuters to avoid the area.\n\nA London ambulance service spokeswoman said three people including the driver had been taken to hospital. Two were described as \"priority\" cases in a stable condition and one had minor injuries. Seven other people were treated at the scene.\n\nAndrew Matthews, 34, of Wandsworth Town, said he was one of about a dozen passengers on the number 77 bus, which was travelling towards London Waterloo. He told the Press Association: \"I was on the top floor at the back, fortunately. I noticed the bus drifting. I heard a smash and saw the roof of the shop going through [the bus] from the front left. It went to the fourth or fifth row.\n\n\"I wedged myself in, bracing myself. As soon as the bus came to a stop there was yelling, screaming. I noticed a lady wedged in the front right-hand side. She was screaming for help. There was a lot of blood.\" Amy Mullineux, 40, a nurse from Wandsworth Common, was also on the bus and said the driver told her he had lost consciousness before the crash.\n\n\"I spoke to him. He said he blacked out before the bus hit the shop. He doesn't remember hitting anything,\" she said. \"The paramedic told me they think he had some kind of fit.\" Solange Morin, 33, had been hoping to catch the bus before she saw it crash. \"I saw this woman [in the bus] shouting and banging on the glass. Everybody shouted 'fire, fire,'\" she told the Press Association. \"I went on to the bus. I talked to her and was holding her hands. She was pinned. I wouldn't have been able to get her out. She was so scared because people were shouting 'fire'. There was a lot of smoke.\"\n\nA Metropolitan police spokesman said: \"Police were called at approximately 6.55am on Thursday 10 August to reports of a bus in collision with a building on Lavender Hill at the junction with Altenburg Gardens, SW11. \"The driver has been taken to a south London hospital. A number of passengers were treated at the scene.\"\n\nMore than two hours after the crash, fire crews with cutting gear were still trying to rescue two women from the top deck. A spokeswoman said at the time: \"We were called at 7am to reports of a bus crashed into a shop front. The shop front has collapsed.

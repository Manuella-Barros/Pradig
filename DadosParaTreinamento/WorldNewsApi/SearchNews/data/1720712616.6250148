That's nothing new, Wylde noted, referencing a commuter tax that was eliminated decades ago at a time when Democratic seats were \"up for grabs\" in the state legislature. \"This is the same kind of situation,\" she said. \"It is a suburban backlash and concerns about candidates, and in particular, Democratic candidates. The politics of it are chronic and there is not a lot we can do about it from the business side.\" Wylde hopes the delay is temporary, and the MTA can move ahead with their plans for leveraging the increased funding. Everywhere that congestion pricing has been introduced globally, she said, it has worked, from London to Stockholm to Singapore. \"There's an opposition going in, and then when people see the results they're thrilled. Because your cost of doing business goes down substantially. ... The quality of life is much better after congestion pricing.\" A former colleague of congestion pricing pioneer Vickrey at Columbia University, Dr. Steven Cohen, Senior Vice Dean at Columbia, wrote in a recent post that unintended consequences and need for policy revision are implicit in any new undertaking, but the city and its commuters could look to big business for the proof that the concept is effective. \"There [undoubtedly] will be unanticipated negative impacts of the new policy. Every new policy and product have downsides you can't predict without experience. ... The point is we can adjust policies and products to address negative impacts. But congestion pricing's underlying policy design is sound. A congestion fee will generate revenue for mass transit and reduce traffic jams. Surge pricing works. It works for Uber and it works for JetBlue.\" Rep. Gottheimer hopes this is the end of the road for congestion pricing, and as far as it coming back after the upcoming elections are decided, \"I don't think so,\" he said. \"We got it done. ... indefinite pause, the word indefinite is key here,\" he said. \"I'm not saying any of this is easy. Things need to be fixed, but today we should focus on the fact that the answer is not just taxing people more.\" He views the issue as more fundamentally about the management of the MTA. In the meantime, congestion isn't getting any better. \"We are in gridlock in the city,\" Wylde said. \"The governor has said her concern is to make sure we are getting it right and not doing anything to damage the Manhattan economy. ... We would be in a lot better shape if we reduced gridlock.\" \u2014By Kaya Ginsky, CNBC News Intern", "summary": "New Yorkers love to complain about traffic.

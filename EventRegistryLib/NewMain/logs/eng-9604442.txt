The party's convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22.\n\nOhio lawmakers have moved the deadline in the past for candidates of both parties, although they had not done so yet for Biden this year and were called to a rare special session by Gov. Mike DeWine to address the issue.\n\nThe virtual proceedings will allow Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to get the party's formal nod and will be very similar to the process used in 2020, when the convention went virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe move also reduces the chances for an unscripted moment during the party's highly produced Chicago convention that could embarrass Biden -- who has faced discontent from some activist members of his party over his support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza -- on live television.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee on Tuesday did not say when the virtual roll call will take place, but it is expected in the weeks after the committee's rules and bylaws committee votes to propose changes to the roll call process. That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,\" Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nOhio lawmakers, meanwhile, were gathering Tuesday for the special session.\n\nNegotiations between the House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nAnd the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nThe Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the

State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen.

The Republican convention, in Milwaukee, is July 15-18, so it doesn't run afoul of Ohio's rules this year.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties.

That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio lawmakers gathered Tuesday for a rare special session called by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to pass legislation ensuring President Joe Biden appears on the state's fall ballot.\n\nLegislators have done this before for Republicans as well as Democrats, but the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nNegotiations between House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nThe legislation needs only to move Ohio's Aug. 7 ballot deadline so that it falls after the Democratic National Convention where Biden will be formally nominated, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-22, in Chicago. The Republican convention, in Milwaukee, is July 15-18, so it doesn't run afoul of Ohio's rules this year.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nBut the Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@maryvilleforum.com", "name": "Associated

The party's convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22.\n\nOhio lawmakers have moved the deadline in the past for candidates of both parties, although they had not done so yet for Biden this year and were called to a rare special session by Gov. Mike DeWine to address the issue.\n\nThe virtual proceedings will allow Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to get the party's formal nod and will be very similar to the process used in 2020, when the convention went virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe move also reduces the chances for an unscripted moment during the party's highly produced Chicago convention that could embarrass Biden -- who has faced discontent from some activist members of his party over his support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza -- on live television.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee on Tuesday did not say when the virtual roll call will take place, but it is expected in the weeks after the committee's rules and bylaws committee votes to propose changes to the roll call process. That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,\" Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nOhio lawmakers, meanwhile, were gathering Tuesday for the special session.\n\nNegotiations between the House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nAnd the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nThe Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.\n\nShipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio lawmakers gathered Tuesday for a rare special session called by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to pass legislation ensuring President Joe Biden appears on the state's fall ballot.\n\nLegislators have done this before for Republicans as well as Democrats, but the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nNegotiations between House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nThe legislation needs only to move Ohio's Aug. 7 ballot deadline so that it falls after the Democratic National Convention where Biden will be formally nominated, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-22, in Chicago. The Republican convention, in Milwaukee, is July 15-18, so it doesn't run afoul of Ohio's rules this year.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nBut the Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.\n\nMore from this section\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22 in Chicago.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree.

Mike DeWine to address the deadline issues. Since Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of the general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nNegotiations between House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep.

Mike DeWine to address the issue.\n\nThe virtual proceedings will allow Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to get the party's formal nod and will be very similar to the process used in 2020, when the convention went virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe move also reduces the chances for an unscripted moment during the party's highly produced Chicago convention that could embarrass Biden -- who has faced discontent from some activist members of his party over his support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza -- on live television.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee on Tuesday did not say when the virtual roll call will take place, but it is expected in the weeks after the committee's rules and bylaws committee votes to propose changes to the roll call process. That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,\" Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nOhio lawmakers, meanwhile, were gathering Tuesday for the special session.\n\nNegotiations between the House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nAnd the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nThe Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

The latter is a direct response to GOP objections to the \"Issue 1\" campaign last year when Swiss billionaire Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss helped fund a ballot measure that enshrined abortion rights in the Ohio Constitution.\n\nDemocrats have objected to Ohio Republicans' efforts to vote push the two issues through during the special session, arguing that the GOP has made a legislative fix to address ballot certification -- a measure that has been granted to both parties in previous election cycles -- a political one.\n\n\"This special session and the combination of these two bills is a political trade made to try and extract some price to be paid for President Biden being on the ballot,\" said House Democratic Whip Dani Isaacsohn during a House Government Oversight Committee meeting on Tuesday morning.\n\nOhio law mandates that political parties confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the general election -- on Aug. 7. Biden won't be the official nominee until the Democratic National Convention convenes on Aug. 19, after the deadline.\n\nSecretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, raised the \"apparent conflict in Ohio law\" to the Democratic Party in April. The legislation Ohio lawmakers are considering this week would extend the deadline to 74 days, which is Aug. 23, following the DNC.\n\nOhio is the only state where Biden would not qualify to be on the ballot this November. Alabama had also encountered conflicts between their ballot certification and Biden's official nomination, but their legislature unanimously passed a fix in May that was then signed by Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican.\n\nThe special session to fix the issue legislatively was urged by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, last week.\n\n\"Ohio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, the sitting president of the United States, on the ballot this fall. Failing to do so is simply not acceptable. This is a ridiculous -- this is an absurd situation,\" DeWine said during a news conference last week.\n\nDeWine also endorsed the GOP-led initiative to bar foreign money from issue campaigns, however.\n\n\"The purpose of this session will be for the General Assembly to pass legislation ensuring that both major presidential candidates will be on the Ohio ballot in November, as well as legislation that would prohibit campaign spending by foreign nationals,\" he said.\n\nAhead of DeWine's push, Ohio House leaders -- Speaker Jason Stephens and House Minority Leader Allison Russo -- both said during separate media gaggles that a legislative fix to Biden's access during the general election was very unlikely.\n\nThe GOP-controlled state Senate introduced and then passed in a party-line vote a bill earlier this month that would extend Ohio's ballot certification deadline so that Biden could still be formally nominated at the DNC. The bill included a portion on foreign money, too.\n\nBut the House then adjourned without considering that Senate version or its own, which just had the ballot fix.\n\nThe Biden campaign has maintained that the president will \"be on the ballot in all 50 states.\"\n\n\"Election after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot. And this election is no different -- Alabama, with full Republican support, and Washington State are already taking action to ensure that voters can exercise their right to vote for the candidate of their choice in November,\" Charles Lutvak, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement to ABC News.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"},

Mike DeWine to pass legislation ensuring President Joe Biden appears on the state\u00b4s fall ballot.\n\nLegislators have done this before for Republicans as well as Democrats, but the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nNegotiations between House and Senate on a solution to Biden\u00b4s ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nThe legislation needs only to move Ohio\u00b4s Aug. 7 ballot deadline so that it falls after the Democratic National Convention where Biden will be formally nominated, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-22, in Chicago. The Republican convention, in Milwaukee, is July 15-18, so it doesn't run afoul of Ohio's rules this year.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nBut the Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat\u00b4s after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio\u00b4s ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it\u00b4s possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The announcement came the same day the Ohio Legislature convened a special session at Gov. Mike DeWine's behest to get Biden on the ballot.\n\nA DNC committee will meet next week to greenlight virtual proceedings, and all members will vote on the change sometime after that. Democrats have not yet set a date for the roll call, which they also held virtually in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\" DNC chair Jaime Harrison said. \"But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own. Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nThe issue with Ohio's ballot surfaced in April when Secretary of State Frank LaRose told Democrats that the certification deadline is 12 days before the DNC. That left the party and Biden campaign with three options: Change convention procedures, sue Ohio or let state lawmakers move the deadline, as they have for past elections.\n\nAlabama and Washington faced the same problem and resolved it. The Alabama Legislature voted to change the deadline, while Washington's secretary of state agreed to provisionally certify Biden. Democrats also sought provisional certification in Ohio, but state officials struck down that idea.\n\nThe prospect of a legislative solution dimmed earlier this month when lawmakers deadlocked on a plan to change the certification date. While the Ohio House proposed a standalone Biden fix, Senate Republicans tacked on separate legislation to ban foreign citizens from contributing to state and local ballot issues. The House didn't vote on either bill.\n\nDemocrats contend the foreign money measure is a \"poison pill\" that will hinder citizen-initiated ballot campaigns. GOP lawmakers saw it as a tradeoff for helping the DNC and Biden campaign solve a problem of their own making. It's already illegal for foreign nationals give money to Ohio candidates or contribute to federal, state or local elections.\n\nFollowing inaction at the statehouse, a frustrated DeWine ordered lawmakers to return this week and address a Biden ballot fix and foreign campaign spending. But Democrats opted to pursue their own path in case lawmakers fail to reach a deal.\n\n\"In addition to being an unprecedented distraction, this petty partisanship is bound to fail,\" said Justin Levitt, a former Biden White House adviser and law professor at Loyola Marymount University. \"Both candidates will inevitably be on the ballot; the only real question is whether Ohio's legislators and secretary of state will feel any shame for lighting their constituents' tax dollars on fire in the meantime.\"\n\nHaley BeMiller is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio lawmakers gathered Tuesday for a rare special session called by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to pass legislation ensuring President Joe Biden appears on the state's fall ballot.\n\nLegislators have done this before for Republicans as well as Democrats, but the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nNegotiations between House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nThe legislation needs only to move Ohio's Aug. 7 ballot deadline so that it falls after the Democratic National Convention where Biden will be formally nominated, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-22, in Chicago. The Republican convention, in Milwaukee, is July 15-18, so it doesn't run afoul of Ohio's rules this year.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nBut the Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.\n\nWill 2024 voter turnout be the same as in the 2020 presidential election?

But will they solve Biden's ballot problem?", "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio state lawmakers are back in Columbus on Tuesday for the first day of a special session GOP Gov. Mike DeWine called to make sure Democratic President Joe Biden is on the November ballot.\n\nLast week, DeWine took the extraordinary step of ordering lawmakers back to Columbus after the two Republican-controlled chambers couldn't come to an agreement in regularly scheduled sessions on a legislative fix that threatens to keep Biden off the ballot.\n\nBut there are no guarantees that the special session will produce that solution. Already, lawmakers are at odds over whether existing legislation can be considered in the special session. If it cannot, new bills would need to have three days of public hearings before they could be put up for a floor vote. With only two days in the special session and a new Wednesday deadline looming, that could spell doom for an agreement that solves Biden's ballot problem.\n\nThe Ohio House and Senate have been at loggerheads for months because of a brewing fight for the House speaker's gavel next year. Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens will seek to retain his post, and Senate President Matt Huffman, term limited in the Senate, is running in a safe Republican House district with plans to challenge him.\n\nWhile both sides have said they favored fixing the law that could keep Biden off the ballot, the Republican supermajorities have failed to come to an agreement. The Senate has passed legislation that includes limits on foreign contributions to state ballot campaigns. The House has refused to take it up.\n\nDemocrats also have opposed the inclusion of the foreign contributions policy. Republicans took it up after they were dealt two defeats on ballot issues in 2023, blaming an infusion of cash from a Swiss billionaire.\n\nIf Biden fails to make the ballot in Ohio this fall, it would be the first time in modern presidential history that a major-party nominee has been unintentionally excluded from any state's ballot. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled two weeks after Ohio's deadline to certify candidates for the November ballot. Ohio lawmakers have adjusted that deadline on multiple occasions for both parties in past presidential cycles.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose sent a letter to Ohio Democrats in April spelling out the calendar problem. At the time, he said the deadline for a legislative fix was May 9. Democrats also could move party business up earlier in the calendar or take the issue to court, where Ohio leaders have said they think they would succeed in getting Biden put on the ballot.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stephens has scheduled a House Rules Committee meeting for 10 a.m. But the House isn't scheduled to convene for a floor session until Thursday. The full Senate is scheduled to meet at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nCleveland.com/The Plain Dealer will have updates to this developing story later today.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeWine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike DeWine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Stephens_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Stephens (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Term limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_LaRose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank LaRose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Rules"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Reflexology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Reflexology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/BO6YBGSUAVB7LP7STUVAC3VKW4.jpg?auth=57fa16c9ca459e59f67e1b3513406cc2407b93fe46add7fd3d889d2990154bd1&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604442", "eventUri": "eng-9604442", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2397, "textEnd": 2402}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The party's convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22.\n\nOhio lawmakers have moved the deadline in the past for candidates of both parties, although they had not done so yet for Biden this year and were called to a rare special session by Gov. Mike DeWine to address the issue.\n\nThe virtual proceedings will allow Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to get the party's formal nod and will be very similar to the process used in 2020, when the convention went virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSt. Louis alt-weekly Riverfront Times sold, lays off all staff Sisters, 8 and 10, who died in wreck on I-270 were best friends, family says The end of Riverfront Times brings shock, sense of loss.

It's time for Cardinals to swing trade for rotation help.\n\nThe move also reduces the chances for an unscripted moment during the party's highly produced Chicago convention that could embarrass Biden -- who has faced discontent from some activist members of his party over his support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza -- on live television.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee on Tuesday did not say when the virtual roll call will take place, but it is expected in the weeks after the committee's rules and bylaws committee votes to propose changes to the roll call process. That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,\" Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nOhio lawmakers, meanwhile, were gathering Tuesday for the special session.\n\nNegotiations between the House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nAnd the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nThe Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.\n\nShipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

State lawmakers return this week to find a solution", "body": "Calling it ridiculous that Ohio has yet to find a fix to make sure President Joe Biden is on the November ballot, Gov. Mike DeWine ordered lawmakers to return to Columbus this week and get it done.\n\nOhio law requires candidates to be added to the ballot 90 days before an election, but the Democratic National Convention meets to nominate Biden after that deadline.\n\nEarlier this month, Ohio lawmakers hit a stalemate and failed to pass a law to change the deadline.\n\nThe Senate passed a fix but tacked on a provision to ban foreign money going to ballot issue campaigns. Democrats called the add-on a \"poison pill\" and a \"sore-loser\" provision. They voted no and the House opted not to take up the bill.\n\nCurrently, Ohio is the only state in the country facing the prospect that voters won't be able to vote for one of the two major party candidates for president.\n\nThe Ohio Senate is scheduled to be in session Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. The House is scheduled to be in session Thursday at 10 a.m.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said the language goes beyond just blocking foreign nationals from contributing money to state or local ballot campaigns. The bill, as written, would add more hurdles for citizen-led efforts to put questions before voters statewide, she said.\n\nLast year, Ohioans rejected a GOP-backed plan to raise the threshold for constitutional amendments and then voted in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana and protecting abortion access.\n\nAntonio said those losses are prompting the Republicans to change the rules.\n\n\"If you lose, you can train harder, you can improve your skill set or you can try to change the rules,\" Antonio said. \"And in the state of Ohio, right now, the supermajority is trying to change the rules.\"\n\nDemocrats also point out that dark money organizations, that don't have to disclose their donors, were instrumental in the biggest public corruption case in state history. The former speaker of the Ohio House, Larry Householder, and former Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges are in prison, two others pleaded guilty and two other men died by suicide in the case that has spanned nearly four years. Despite that, state lawmakers have left reform bills on the table.\n\nEarlier this month, the Ohio Senate voted 24-7 along party lines for House Bill 114. It includes a provision to move the deadline for certifying Biden to the ballot to align with the Democratic National Convention dates. And it bans foreign nationals from raising or spending money in state or local ballot issues.\n\nIt's already illegal for foreign citizens to give money to candidates in Ohio. And federal law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing directly or indirectly to any federal, state or local election.\n\nHere is what else the bill would do:\n\nAccording to the Legislative Service Commission bill analysis, if an organization had two branches and one branch received foreign donations that were later co-mingled in an account accessed by the other branch for a ballot campaign, they'd be violating the law.\n\nCatherine Turcer, a campaign finance expert with Common Cause Ohio, said banning foreign money in ballot campaigns sounds easy but the bill raises questions about how it would work.\n\nIn November, the Catholic Church spent money against the abortion rights ballot issue. Turcer said the proposed bill would prohibit any foreign money - from church plate collections to money raised overseas - going toward a ballot issue.\n\nOhio has three co-equal branches of government: the executive, judicial and legislative branches. The Ohio Constitution has a seldom used provision that authorizes the governor to call a special legislative session. Basically, he can order lawmakers to meet on a specific topic.\n\nIn December 2004, then Gov. Bob Taft used the provision to bring state lawmakers back to Columbus to deal with a campaign finance issue. The House and Senate voted along party lines to increase political contribution limits, require more disclosures, prohibit contributions by children under age 7 and make other changes.\n\nTo be determined. Just because the governor tells them to get to work, doesn't mean lawmakers will do what he wants.\n\nIn December as Ohio's new recreational marijuana law took effect, DeWine publicly urged the House to adopt regulations that the Senate supported. The House declined.\n\nOn Thursday, the governor laid blame on the House for failing to fix the issues and ordered lawmakers back to Columbus on Tuesday to pass legislation that would put Biden on the November ballot and ban foreign money in ballot campaigns.\n\nHouse Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, indicated a compromise could be in the works over the foreign campaign money.\n\n\"We have language that has input from campaign finance experts and important interested parties to deal with the issue,\" he said in a statement. \"This is language that squarely and directly bans foreign influence in Ohio's issue campaigns, while not also inadvertently limiting the rights of citizens to have their voices heard.\"\n\nThis story will be updated", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

This is ridiculous; this is an absurd situation.\"\n\nDeWine is using his executive authority to force the lawmakers to get it together and do their jobs.\n\nOH House agrees to compromise on Biden ballot fix if 'anti-democratic' Senate provisions taken out of bill\n\nRELATED: OH House agrees to compromise on Biden ballot fix if 'anti-democratic' Senate provisions taken out of bill\n\nWho are the major players to focus on this week?\n\nThe relationship between House Speaker Jason Stephens (R-Kitts Hill) and Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) is always one to watch at the Statehouse, as the pair are rivals and do not like each other. This debacle has exacerbated the GOP infighting. Click here to learn more.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo (D-Upper Arlington) and Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio (D-Lakewood) will also be involved in the process. Negotiating will likely be between House Majority Floor Leader Bill Seitz (R-Cincinnati) and Senate Majority Floor Leader Rob McColley (R-Napoleon).\n\nThe governor and Sec. of State Frank LaRose may also provide insight during the week.\n\nWhat is the problem?\n\nRight now, Biden, the presumptive nominee for the Democratic party, wouldn't be on the ballot. He will \"100% be\" on the ballot, every lawmaker has said, but this is just a whole mess right now.\n\nOhio requires parties to confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the Nov. election, which would be Aug. 7. But Biden won't be the official nominee until the Democratic National Convention, which is on Aug. 19.\n\nThe little-known law was passed in a major omnibus bill in 2010. In 2012 and 2020, exemptions were passed for those years -- impacting both parties. In 2016, both the DNC and the RNC held their conventions before the deadline.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine calls lawmakers into special session to fix Biden ballot debacle\n\nRELATED: Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine calls lawmakers into special session to fix Biden ballot debacle\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nHere is a timeline.\n\nApril 5: LaRose's legal team emailed Statehouse Democratic leadership and Ohio Democratic Party Chairperson Liz Walters that there was \"an apparent conflict\" between the nominating deadline and the DNC event, according to an email I obtained.\n\nApril 6-16: For the following weeks, lawmakers went back and forth on what to do.\n\nApril 17: Ultimately, Republicans agreed to actively help the Democrats by making sure Biden was on the ballot.\n\nMay 7: A House committee passed their bipartisan ballot fix proposal out of committee.\n\nThey completely stripped and amended Senate Bill 92 making it a clean bill. It changed the nomination deadline to 74 days, which is Aug. 23. This would likely be a permanent fix. It also allowed for less formal declarations of candidate nomination.\n\nThe main reason why lawmakers often choose to amend bills at the last minute is due to timing. By revising an already passed piece of legislation, one that typically is ready to be passed by the second chamber, the lawmakers fast-track the process of getting it to the governor.\n\n\"It enables the notification to be a lot more flexible, whether it's email or whatever,\" Stephens said about his bill. \"This gives the flexibility.\"\n\nThis doesn't just help the Democrats, Stephens added.\n\n\"Just four years ago, we had this issue,\" the speaker said. \"The party in power in the White House usually goes last for the convention, so hopefully this will take care of that issue.\"\n\nRusso, who has a good relationship with Stephens, was pleased.\n\n\"I think everyone agreed this is good for democracy,\" Russo said. \"We want people to have full access to the ballot, and that's good for both parties.\"\n\nMay 8: The Senate passed H.B. 114 out of the chamber. It changed the nominating deadline from Aug. 7 to Aug. 23 -- but only for 2024, so it wasn't a permanent fix.\n\nThe lawmakers also added in S.B. 215, a campaign finance bill. In early March, Republican senators passed legislation meant to stop foreign donations to state and local ballot-issue campaigns. This could be by directly donating from outside the country or by donating to an entity, like a political action committee (PAC).\n\n\"Most Ohioans would agree that we shouldn't have foreign dollars affecting our ballot initiatives,\" Huffman said. \"Foreign money needs to be out of these statewide elections.\"\n\nThis addition was unacceptable to the Democrats, Antonio said.\n\n\"The language that has been embedded into 114 is yet another attempt to try to silence the voters of Ohio when they disagree with the supermajority of Republicans and go on their own to put together a ballot initiative,\" Antonio said.\n\nIt has provisions that could make it harder for grassroots movements to get on the ballot -- even with U.S. dollars.\n\nBiden ballot debacle continues in Ohio Statehouse as deadline passes\n\nRELATED: Biden ballot debacle continues in Ohio Statehouse as deadline passes\n\nIt would require all groups rallying for a cause that is receiving donations and spending money to register as a PAC. This means that groups would have to file disclosures with the government, and it could make it more difficult to collect signatures to get a proposal on a township ballot.\n\nThe bill also prohibits a lawful permanent U.S. resident, also known as a green card holder, from making contributions or expenditures regarding ballot issues or candidates.\n\nAll the Democrats voted no because of S.B. 215. Still, it passed 24-7.\n\n\"Republicans in both the House and the Senate aren't going to vote for a standalone Biden bill,\" Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said, defending why he put the bills all together.\n\nAcross the Statehouse, the House \"informally passed\" its version of the Biden fix, S.B. 92. This means it stays on the calendar but doesn't actually pass and isn't put up for a vote. It can be brought up for a vote at a later date.\n\nThe Senate sent over their bill to the House, who ignored it.\n\n\"We had those conversations and ended up not doing it today,\" Stephens said about not concurring.\n\nMay 20: House lawmakers introduced H.B. 609. The bill prohibits the committee in charge of a statewide initiative or referendum petition from asking for or knowingly accepting money from a foreign entity or person. It also declares the bill as an emergency.\n\nThis bill has bipartisan support, as it doesn't have significant negative impacts on local community members, House Minority Whip Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinnati) said.\n\nMay 22: When the Senate saw that the House wasn't taking their bait with H.B. 114, they amended yet another bill to further their elimination of foreign contributions in state ballot campaigns.\n\nH.B. 305, when it comes to campaign finance, does relatively the same as S.B. 215 and H.B. 114.\n\nMay 23: DeWine staged a surprise evening press conference, calling for a special session.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary situation when we have [a] ridiculous situation that we have not taken action to deal with a problem,\" DeWine said.\n\nSession will last from Tuesday through the special voting session on Thursday.\n\nSiding with the Senate, the governor urged the House to take up any of their three bills. However, his proclamation did state that legislators can also consider S.B. 92. He did not include H.B. 609, but the document states that lawmakers can review \"other similar legislation effectuating this purpose.\"\n\nWe agree with the Governor. It is time to protect Ohio's elections by outlawing foreign campaign contributions, while at the same time fixing the Democratic Party's error that kept Joe Biden off the November ballot. We encourage the Speaker and Minority Leader to allow a vote on House Bill 114 which does both.\n\nThe House leaders -- both Democrats like Isaacsohn and Republicans like Stephens -- continue to say that it isn't the foreign interference ban that they are rejecting; it is the new restrictions to access to the ballot for citizens.\n\nStephens says he is willing to compromise -- by making sure that a bill doesn't \"limit the rights of citizens to have their voices heard.\"\n\n\"For weeks, we have been pushing to find a legislative solution to having President Biden on the ballot. Ultimately, the will to do so wasn't there in the Republican caucus.\n\nEveryone agrees that we need to ban foreign political contributions from ballot issue campaigns in Ohio, and we have been driving towards a solution.\n\nWe have language that has input from campaign finance experts and important interested parties to deal with the issue. This is language that squarely and directly bans foreign influence in Ohio's issue campaigns, while not also inadvertently limiting the rights of citizens to have their voices heard.\n\nWe look forward to real solutions that will actually pass both chambers next week and solve problems.\"\n\nWhat happens if the lawmakers don't find a compromise by the end of the legislative session?\n\nNothing, actually. All the proclamation does is force the lawmakers to \"consider\" his pleas, according to Seitz. Also, this situation is now much more complicated than the governor made it out to be, Seitz seemed to suggest.\n\n\"These are snap decisions that have to be made sort of in a big hurry,\" he said about DeWine's surprise presser. \"Our original plan in the House was to have session on June 12 -- We wanted to give everybody plenty of notice so that they could rearrange their plans and rearranged to be in Columbus on June 12.\"\n\nFor an emergency clause, two-thirds of the representatives must vote yes. That is easily done in the Senate, considering that there would be 22 members and there are 26 Republicans in the chamber. In the House, one in which the GOP is fractured, an emergency would need 66 votes. There are 67 Republicans, and at least four refuse to vote for anything that helps Biden at all, according to Seitz. He doesn't think the Democrats would vote in favor of the foreign money ban, so he has to make sure that 66 Republicans not only show up but also support the bill.\n\n\"We do not think there is a ghost of a chance of getting an emergency clause on any bill that would put Biden on the ballot,\" he said. \"We don't think that's even feasible.\"\n\nBut there are significant challenges with this. Bills must be heard on three separate days, and with the governor calling the session on Tuesday, that means the bill needs to be done and in committee the same day and then continued on Wednesday and Thursday. They must be done by then when their legal team advises them they must be done by Wednesday, and they don't even have the vehicle to get this done.\n\nClick here to read more from Seitz.\n\nOther options?\n\nThe DNC can announce early. Or the lawmakers can do something within a tight time frame that even Seitz seems nervous about.\n\nLawmakers have been suggesting Democrats can go to court to get the president on the ballot.\n\nCase Western Reserve University law professor Jonathan Entin said no court case would work. Learn more about his analysis here.\n\n\"What seems to be going on reflects yet again how dysfunctional the Ohio government is,\" Entin said. \"There's plenty of faults to be laid on just about everybody.\"\n\nYou can fault the Democrats for not knowing the law, the entire legislative leadership for being uncooperative and constantly bickering and LaRose for \"waiting until virtually the last minute to raise the issue,\" the professor added.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that anybody could go broke underestimating the irresponsibility of Ohio officials dealing with this situation,\" Entin sighed.\n\nFollow WEWS statehouse reporter Morgan Trau on Twitter and Facebook.", "source": {"uri": "wcpo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCPO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_trau@wcpo.com",

The party's convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22.\n\nOhio lawmakers have moved the deadline in the past for candidates of both parties, although they had not done so yet for Biden this year and were called to a rare special session by Gov. Mike DeWine to address the issue.\n\nThe virtual proceedings will allow Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to get the party's formal nod and will be very similar to the process used in 2020, when the convention went virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,\" Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nOhio lawmakers, meanwhile, were gathering Tuesday for the special session.\n\nNegotiations between the House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nAnd the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nThe Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.\n\nShipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.\n\nWill 2024 voter turnout be the same as in the 2020 presidential election?

The latter was a direct response to GOP objections to the \"Issue 1\" campaign last year that constitutionally protected abortion in the state. The move came without Democratic support, however, with members seemingly empowered to vote against the legislation following the DNC announcement.\n\n\"We don't need your fix. The DNC just released a statement several minutes ago that says we're going to hold a virtual vote of our delegates across the country and nominate President Biden to the ballot,\" State Sen. Bill DeMora said on Tuesday. \"We don't want a legislative fix that holds the voters and their rights to the whim of the majority.\"\n\nBiden's ballot access had been uncertain in Ohio because of a conflict over the president's official party nomination and state election certification deadlines. The DNC's move to hold virtual nominations bypasses the ballot access concerns in the state.\n\nOhio law mandates that political parties confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the general election -- on Aug. 7. While Biden wouldn't have been the official nominee until the DNC convenes on Aug. 19, after the deadline -- however the virtual nomination helps ensure that Biden is nominated before the Aug. 7 deadline.\n\nThe legislation Ohio Senators passed Tuesday extended the deadline to 74 days, which is Aug. 23, following the DNC. The House still needs to take up the bill.\n\nThe Ohio Senate on Tuesday considered just one bill that combined both the ballot issue fix for Biden and also the banning of foreign contributions to issue campaigns. Democrats had objected to Ohio Republicans' efforts to vote push the two issues through during the special session, arguing that the GOP has made a legislative fix to address ballot certification -- a measure that has been granted to both parties in previous election cycles -- a political one.\n\n\"This special session and the combination of these two bills is a political trade made to try and extract some price to be paid for President Biden being on the ballot,\" said House Democratic Whip Dani Isaacsohn during a House Government Oversight Committee meeting on Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublicans have denied the assertion that they were being \"partisan\" in trying to combine the issues.\n\n\"Which side is really being partisan? Because if we all agree that foreign election interference and foreign contributions into our elections are a problem, then why would somebody vote no on this bill?\" said Republican Sen. Rob McColley.\n\nOhio is the only state where Biden would not qualify to be on the ballot this November. Alabama had also encountered conflicts between their ballot certification and Biden's official nomination, but their legislature unanimously passed a fix in May that was then signed by Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican.\n\n\"The fact that we couldn't -- like Alabama and any other state that had to deal with the issue this time -- just pass a clean bill and put Biden on the ballot and deal with all the other issues ... separately. But to put them together has been the thing of heartburn for all of us,\" said Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, a Democrat, Tuesday on the floor.\n\nThe special session to fix the issue legislatively was urged by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, last week.\n\nDeWine also endorsed the GOP-led initiative to bar foreign money from issue campaigns, however.\n\nThe Biden campaign has maintained that the president will \"be on the ballot in all 50 states.\"\n\n\"Election after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot. And this election is no different -- Alabama, with full Republican support, and Washington State are already taking action to ensure that voters can exercise their right to vote for the candidate of their choice in November,\" Charles Lutvak, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement to ABC News.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [],

Again. Turns out underhanded, undemocratic schemes to consolidate unilateral power are a feature, not a bug of Ohio's one-party tyranny in the state. You and I are being systemically disempowered as an electoral check on imperious partisans who seek to rule not represent.\n\nOhio Republicans, who control every branch of state government and have gerrymandered themselves into unaccountable Statehouse supermajorities, have outdone themselves with their latest stunt: a twisted legislative maneuver to exploit a state ballot issue affecting the sitting president of the United States. Yep. That's where we are, Ohio.\n\nThe ballot question involving candidate certification deadlines has come up twice before in presidential election years (2012, 2020) and been resolved by bipartisan consensus without pre-conditions. Not in 2024. Ohio Senate Republicans made a minor deadline extension for President Biden conditional on partisan gain. Forget bipartisan comity for the sake of democracy.\n\nOhio Senate President Matt Huffman is a control freak. The Lima Republican didn't hesitate to draft a plan that would subvert the sovereignty of voters (and direct democracy) and roll it into a simple ballot fix. Huffman's nemesis, Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens, didn't hesitate to crater the Senate legislation and ditch a clean ballot resolution to certify Biden for the general election because \"why create a stir that's not necessary.\" Why??\n\nWhy allow Ohioans a choice of major party candidates for the presidency? \"There's just not the will to do that from the legislature,\" said Stephens. \"Republicans in both the House and the Senate aren't going to vote for a stand-alone Biden bill,\" said Huffman after inserting his unrelated amendments (into what should have been a stand-alone ballot measure) as the GOP's price for allowing a fair election in the fall.\n\nIt's the one-party-price-or-else plan for disenfranchising nearly 500,000 Ohioans who handed Biden an overwhelming primary win in March and the millions who may vote for him in November. Sadly, holding democracy hostage to devious legislative riders is emblematic of the self-serving, anti-democratic party presiding over Ohio with a pronounced disdain for voters.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine is no outlier in his party's political sabotage machine. And he is no hero for ordering a special session of the General Assembly this week to get Biden on the general election ballot by legislative fiat. It was a cunning performance by the governor to appear as though he had a spine regarding Statehouse Republicans.\n\nDeWine played the unconvincing role of adult in the room corralling misbehaving children. Straighten up and put the prospective Democratic nominee for president on the ballot, he thundered. His \"moderate\" role-playing was also a gambit to mitigate the bad national publicity Ohio has been receiving for shamelessly trying to leverage ballot placement of a major party candidate for partisan points.\n\nBut DeWine's guise about giving a damn over the basic principle that Ohioans should be able to vote for either major party candidate seeking the presidency was blown when he embraced partisan legislation as leverage. He sided with Huffman's ploy to score political paybacks as a condition to grant Biden ballot access.\n\nThe Senate leader is still smarting over his smackdown in two statewide referendums last year. So Senate Republicans came up with a red herring designed to prevent what happened in 2023 (with both Issue 1s) from happening again. No more citizen revolt at the polls to circumvent an extremist legislature. No siree. Not if Huffman et al have their way.\n\nInstead of sending a no-strings-attached bill to the Ohio House to ensure Biden gets on the ballot in the fall, the Senate larded the legislation with a provision to ban foreign spending on state ballot issues. The add-on is a smokescreen to throw a wrench into future citizen ballot initiatives -- like the one advancing to end gerrymandering in Ohio.\n\nThe devil is in the details of this disingenuous move which goes beyond banning foreign nationals (already barred from contributing to candidates and campaigns) with new requirements and hurdles intended to stop grassroots groups in their tracks. It is Huffman's way to make it even more difficult for ordinary citizens to launch a ballot initiative -- especially one opposed by the ruling class.\n\nAlso slyly folded into the compromised ballot bill embraced by DeWine was another \"poison pill\" that is also related to last year's successful citizen initiative to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution. This one attempts to short-circuit the legal process governing lower courts that temporarily block enforcement of state law while it is being challenged as unconstitutional -- like Ohio's abortion law. It was put on hold pending resolution of lawsuits that argue it in violation of the Ohio Constitution after passage of Issue 1.\n\nRepublicans aim to leap-frog over temporary restraining orders from county courts straight up to the partisan, Republican-majority state supreme court with an expedited appeal to overrule the common-pleas court judges blocking state law enacted by Republicans. Sound on the up-and-up to you? Me, neither. But there it is, along with the bogus foreign nationals ban tucked into Huffman's outrageous tradeoff to put Biden on the ballot.\n\nDeWine endorsed the crass charade in his proclamation calling the legislature into special session.

The party's convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22.\n\nOhio lawmakers have moved the deadline in the past for candidates of both parties, although they had not done so yet for Biden this year and were called to a rare special session by Gov. Mike DeWine to address the issue.\n\nThe virtual proceedings will allow Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to get the party's formal nod and will be very similar to the process used in 2020, when the convention went virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPeople are also reading... 2 men killed in early morning shooting at southwest Lincoln strip club Amie Just: Friday night football at Memorial Stadium is bound to be a logistical nightmare Tornado hits Lake McConaughy; trees damaged in Lincoln by overnight storms Nebraska wins its first Big Ten baseball tournament championship Owners of ex-Railyard restaurant ordered to pay $471K for back rent Nebraska football hosting Big Ten Friday night game on Fox Former Lincoln radio host Jack Riggins sues successor Dan Parsons for defamation 'Lincoln was really lucky' -- Beloved longtime child care center closes its doors Nebraska baseball punches ticket to Big Ten tournament championship game Lincoln singer Bryan Olesen takes third on 'The Voice' City of Lincoln ordered to pay $727K in attorney fees, costs in settled discrimination lawsuit Nebraska softball addresses roster holes with commitments from Camenzind twins Nebraska football notes: Former NU staffer named in lawsuit, ex-Huskers on the move Lincoln teen charged with first-degree murder of 16-year-old boy Amie Just: Nebraska's challenge, Greg Sharpe's call, Bolt's bonuses and more baseball thoughts\n\nThe move also reduces the chances for an unscripted moment during the party's highly produced Chicago convention that could embarrass Biden -- who has faced discontent from some activist members of his party over his support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza -- on live television.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee on Tuesday did not say when the virtual roll call will take place, but it is expected in the weeks after the committee's rules and bylaws committee votes to propose changes to the roll call process. That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,\" Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nOhio lawmakers, meanwhile, were gathering Tuesday for the special session.\n\nNegotiations between the House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nAnd the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nThe Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.\n\nShipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.\n\nWill 2024 voter turnout be the same as in the 2020 presidential election?

The committee's vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\nThe decision to move ahead with the nomination came after Republican state lawmakers in Ohio repeatedly failed to shift the ballot access date, as has been done in the past for both parties.

The party's convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22. Ohio lawmakers have moved the deadline in the past for candidates of both parties, although they had not done so yet for Biden this year.\n\nThe virtual proceedings will allow Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to get the party's formal nod, and will be very similar to the process used in 2020, when the convention went virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee on Tuesday did not say when the virtual roll call will take place, but it is expected in the weeks after the committee's rules and bylaws committee votes to propose changes to the roll call process. That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\nPeople are also reading...

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio lawmakers gathered Tuesday for a rare special session called by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to pass legislation ensuring President Joe Biden appears on the state's fall ballot.\n\nLegislators have done this before for Republicans as well as Democrats, but the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nNegotiations between House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe legislation needs only to move Ohio's Aug. 7 ballot deadline so that it falls after the Democratic National Convention where Biden will be formally nominated, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-22, in Chicago. The Republican convention, in Milwaukee, is July 15-18, so it doesn't run afoul of Ohio's rules this year.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nBut the Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.\n\nWill 2024 voter turnout be the same as in the 2020 presidential election?

The announcement came the same day the Ohio Legislature convened a special session at Gov. Mike DeWine's behest to get Biden on the ballot.\n\nA DNC committee will meet next week to greenlight virtual proceedings, and all members will vote on the change sometime after that. Democrats have not yet set a date for the roll call, which they also held virtually in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\" DNC chair Jaime Harrison said. \"But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own. Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nThe issue with Ohio's ballot surfaced in April when Secretary of State Frank LaRose told Democrats that the certification deadline is 12 days before the DNC. That left the party and Biden campaign with three options: Change convention procedures, sue Ohio or let state lawmakers move the deadline, as they have for past elections.\n\nAlabama and Washington faced the same problem and resolved it. The Alabama Legislature voted to change the deadline, while Washington's secretary of state agreed to provisionally certify Biden. Democrats also sought provisional certification in Ohio, but state officials struck down that idea.\n\nThe prospect of a legislative solution dimmed earlier this month when lawmakers deadlocked on a plan to change the certification date. While the Ohio House proposed a standalone Biden fix, Senate Republicans tacked on separate legislation to ban foreign citizens from contributing to state and local ballot issues. The House didn't vote on either bill.\n\nDemocrats contend the foreign money measure is a \"poison pill\" that will hinder citizen-initiated ballot campaigns. GOP lawmakers saw it as a tradeoff for helping the DNC and Biden campaign solve a problem of their own making. It's already illegal for foreign nationals give money to Ohio candidates or contribute to federal, state or local elections.\n\nFollowing inaction at the statehouse, a frustrated DeWine ordered lawmakers to return this week and address a Biden ballot fix and foreign campaign spending. But Democrats opted to pursue their own path in case lawmakers fail to reach a deal.\n\n\"In addition to being an unprecedented distraction, this petty partisanship is bound to fail,\" said Justin Levitt, a former Biden White House adviser and law professor at Loyola Marymount University. \"Both candidates will inevitably be on the ballot; the only real question is whether Ohio's legislators and secretary of state will feel any shame for lighting their constituents' tax dollars on fire in the meantime.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.dispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Columbus

Mike DeWine to resolve the issue.\n\nThe Democratic convention -- where the party traditionally nominates its candidates for president and vice president -- is scheduled after Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for certifying candidates. Ohio GOP lawmakers, who hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate, have been been reluctant to pass a bill relaxing that deadline for Biden without a vote on unrelated campaign finance legislation that Democrats have described as a \"poison pill.\"\n\nDemocrats \"will land this plane on our own,\" DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nThe DNC's rules and bylaws committee is expected to vote June 4 on a resolution to allow for the virtual roll call. DNC members will vote on the resolution in the following weeks and, once adopted, a virtual nomination process can proceed. Party officials are likening the approach to the virtual convention held in 2020 during the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign and DNC had for weeks resisted going forward with such plans. Ohio's certification deadlines have come before both parties' nominating conventions in the past, and in those instances, both parties resolved the issue cleanly, without rancor.\n\nBut in calling for the special session, DeWine requested that lawmakers tackle both a Biden ballot fix and a measure to ban foreign money in state ballot issue campaigns. The latter measure had been attached to a previous state Senate version of the Biden-related bill, but the state House never voted on it, triggering the scramble and DeWine's call for a special session.\n\n\"Once again, Republican politicians at the statehouse are playing politics with our democracy by trying to prevent Ohio voters from choosing who they want to be president, but Democrats will not trade Ohioans' ability to hold their government accountable for presidential ballot access,\" Liz Walters, the Ohio Democratic Party chair, said in a statement.\n\nNickie Antonio, the Democratic leader in the Ohio Senate, announced the change in strategy at a news conference Tuesday.\n\n\"The first thing we've done is we have asked the Biden campaign to issue a statement, which they will do today, assuring the people in the state of Ohio that Joe Biden will be on the ballot because they are going to go in an alternative direction to find a solution that does not include the Ohio Legislature,\" Antonio said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_j_gomez@nbcnews.com", "name": "Henry J.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)\n\nThey're playing dirty. Again. Turns out underhanded, undemocratic schemes to consolidate unilateral power are a feature, not a bug of Ohio's one-party tyranny in the state. You and I are being systemically disempowered as an electoral check on imperious partisans who seek to rule not represent.\n\nOhio Republicans, who control every branch of state government and have gerrymandered themselves into unaccountable Statehouse supermajorities, have outdone themselves with their latest stunt: a twisted legislative maneuver to exploit a state ballot issue affecting the sitting president of the United States. Yep. That's where we are, Ohio.\n\nThe ballot question involving candidate certification deadlines has come up twice before in presidential election years (2012, 2020) and been resolved by bipartisan consensus without pre-conditions. Not in 2024. Ohio Senate Republicans made a minor deadline extension for President Biden conditional on partisan gain. Forget bipartisan comity for the sake of democracy.\n\nOhio Senate President Matt Huffman is a control freak. The Lima Republican didn't hesitate to draft a plan that would subvert the sovereignty of voters (and direct democracy) and roll it into a simple ballot fix. Huffman's nemesis, Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens, didn't hesitate to crater the Senate legislation and ditch a clean ballot resolution to certify Biden for the general election because \"why create a stir that's not necessary.\" Why??\n\nWhy allow Ohioans a choice of major party candidates for the presidency? \"There's just not the will to do that from the legislature,\" said Stephens. \"Republicans in both the House and the Senate aren't going to vote for a stand-alone Biden bill,\" said Huffman after inserting his unrelated amendments (into what should have been a stand-alone ballot measure) as the GOP's price for allowing a fair election in the fall.\n\nIt's the one-party-price-or-else plan for disenfranchising nearly 500,000 Ohioans who handed Biden an overwhelming primary win in March and the millions who may vote for him in November. Sadly, holding democracy hostage to devious legislative riders is emblematic of the self-serving, anti-democratic party presiding over Ohio with a pronounced disdain for voters.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine is no outlier in his party's political sabotage machine. And he is no hero for ordering a special session of the General Assembly this week to get Biden on the general election ballot by legislative fiat. It was a cunning performance by the governor to appear as though he had a spine regarding Statehouse Republicans.\n\nDeWine played the unconvincing role of adult in the room corralling misbehaving children. Straighten up and put the prospective Democratic nominee for president on the ballot, he thundered. His \"moderate\" role-playing was also a gambit to mitigate the bad national publicity Ohio has been receiving for shamelessly trying to leverage ballot placement of a major party candidate for partisan points.\n\nBut DeWine's guise about giving a damn over the basic principle that Ohioans should be able to vote for either major party candidate seeking the presidency was blown when he embraced partisan legislation as leverage. He sided with Huffman's ploy to score political paybacks as a condition to grant Biden ballot access.\n\nThe Senate leader is still smarting over his smackdown in two statewide referendums last year. So Senate Republicans came up with a red herring designed to prevent what happened in 2023 (with both Issue 1s) from happening again. No more citizen revolt at the polls to circumvent an extremist legislature. No siree. Not if Huffman et al have their way.\n\nInstead of sending a no-strings-attached bill to the Ohio House to ensure Biden gets on the ballot in the fall, the Senate larded the legislation with a provision to ban foreign spending on state ballot issues. The add-on is a smokescreen to throw a wrench into future citizen ballot initiatives -- like the one advancing to end gerrymandering in Ohio.\n\nThe devil is in the details of this disingenuous move which goes beyond banning foreign nationals (already barred from contributing to candidates and campaigns) with new requirements and hurdles intended to stop grassroots groups in their tracks. It is Huffman's way to make it even more difficult for ordinary citizens to launch a ballot initiative -- especially one opposed by the ruling class.\n\nAlso slyly folded into the compromised ballot bill embraced by DeWine was another \"poison pill\" that is also related to last year's successful citizen initiative to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution. This one attempts to short-circuit the legal process governing lower courts that temporarily block enforcement of state law while it is being challenged as unconstitutional -- like Ohio's abortion law. It was put on hold pending resolution of lawsuits that argue it in violation of the Ohio Constitution after passage of Issue 1.\n\nRepublicans aim to leap-frog over temporary restraining orders from county courts straight up to the partisan, Republican-majority state supreme court with an expedited appeal to overrule the common-pleas court judges blocking state law enacted by Republicans. Sound on the up-and-up to you? Me, neither. But there it is, along with the bogus foreign nationals ban tucked into Huffman's outrageous tradeoff to put Biden on the ballot.\n\nDeWine endorsed the crass charade in his proclamation calling the legislature into special session. Shame on him. Shame on them all. Playing dirty. Again.\n\nThe post Ohio Senate Republicans make Biden ballot fix conditional on attacking voter ballot initiatives appeared first on Ohio Capital Journal.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

This is Biden's last State of the Union address before the general election this coming November. Biden was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA). (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine wants Ohio lawmakers to get it together and has called a special session Tuesday to get them to do their jobs -- fix an obscure law so President Joe Biden can be on the November ballot. Now, the two chambers must scramble to compromise on each of their proposals. The House, which has been holding up the progress, said it will compromise with the Senate, but only if the \"anti-democratic\" provisions are taken out of the bill.\n\n\"Ohio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, sitting president of the United States, on the ballot this fall,\" DeWine said during a Thursday evening surprise press conference. \"Failing to do so is simply not acceptable. This is ridiculous; this is an absurd situation.\"\n\nRight now, Biden, the presumptive nominee for the Democratic party, wouldn't be on the ballot. He will \"100% be\" on the ballot, every lawmaker has said, but they've also been skeptical whether it would happen through lawmakers or another avenue.\n\nOhio requires parties to confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the Nov. election, which would be Aug. 7. But Biden won't be the official nominee until the Democratic National Convention, which is on Aug. 19.\n\nDemocratic leaders were unaware of this, and plenty of other lawmakers across the aisle also didn't know. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose didn't remind Dems until April.\n\nIn theory, both the House and the Senate have similar fixes to the ballot problem -- but they have failed to get the legislation done and signed into law.\n\nThe House version was a clean bill that changed the nomination deadline to 74 days, which is Aug. 23. This would likely be a permanent fix.\n\nBut the Senate passed a separate bill. It changed the nominating deadline from Aug. 7 to Aug. 23 -- but only for 2024, so it wasn't a permanent fix.\n\nWhile the House version simply changes the nominating deadline, state Rep. Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinnati) said the Senate's version has unacceptable additions.\n\n\"The Senate Republicans decided, 'You know what? We want to extract a cost to get the president on the ballot,'\" Isaacsohn said.\n\nThis is \"anti-democratic,\" Isaacsohn, as well as dozens of other Democrats have said.\n\nThe lawmakers added in Senate Bill 215, a campaign finance bill. In early March, Republican senators passed legislation meant to stop foreign donations to state and local ballot-issue campaigns. This could be by directly donating from outside the country or by donating to an entity, like a political action committee (PAC).\n\nSenate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) explains this helps prevent interference.\n\n\"Most Ohioans would agree that we shouldn't have foreign dollars affecting our ballot initiatives,\" Huffman said.\n\nThat is a red herring, Isaacsohn argued, because the Senate proposal also has provisions that could make it harder for grassroots movements to get on the ballot -- even with U.S. dollars.\n\nIt would require all groups rallying for a cause that is receiving donations and spending money to register as a PAC. This means that groups would have to file disclosures with the government, and it could make it more difficult to collect signatures to get a proposal on a township ballot.\n\nThe bill also prohibits a lawful permanent U.S. resident, also known as a green card holder, from making contributions or expenditures regarding ballot issues or candidates.\n\n\"All of it is an attempt to make it harder to pass ballot initiatives in Ohio, which as you know, are the way in which voters -- in the most pure sense -- make their voice heard because it is direct democracy,\" Isaacsohn said.\n\nDemocrats in both the House and the Senate say that the Republicans who introduced this measure are just mad about their 2023 losses.\n\nAll three ballot proposals that passed last year were started because voters weren't happy with the state legislature and didn't feel like their voices were being heard. The August special election was proposed by lawmakers because they didn't want abortion to become legal -- a direct result of the angry voices of citizens.\n\nS. B. 215's bill sponsor, state Sen. Rob McColley (R-Napoleon), said in a previous interview that this wouldn't negatively impact the local advocates trying to get a stop sign.\n\n\"If you're going to collect and spend money in support of signature gathering, in support of a ballot initiative, you got to report your money,\" McColley said.\n\nLegislation like this is already in effect federally, and it also applies to candidates in Ohio -- just not ballot initiatives, so this is catching the law up, he added.\n\nDeWine agreed.\n\n\"I don't find it a very controversial issue,\" DeWine said. \"We should not have foreign nationals interfering and spending money in Ohio ballot races.\"\n\nThe governor is urging the House to concur on it, seemingly calling them irresponsible for their lack of action in the process.\n\n\"The House of Representatives has failed to do this -- the legislature had session yesterday and again failed to take any action,\" the governor said. \"This is simply unacceptable.\"\n\nHuffman also took a shot at the House in a statement:\n\nThe Senate President's spokesperson seemingly suggests that Minority Leader Allison Russo is preventing the bill from hitting the floor -- despite Stephens having a supermajority of Republicans. Stephens has been accused of being too close with the Democrats and allowing Russo to make decisions. The speaker has denied this, and so has Russo.\n\nThe House leaders -- both Democrats like Isaacsohn and Republicans like House Speaker Jason Stephens (R-Kitts Hill) -- continue to say that it isn't the foreign interference ban that they are rejecting; it is the new restrictions to access to the ballot for citizens.\n\nSpeaker Jason Stephens says he is willing to compromise -- by making sure that a bill doesn't \"limit the rights of citizens to have their voices heard.\"\n\nThe speaker is referencing H.B. 609, a new bill regarding foreign money, one without significant negative impacts on local community members, Isaacsohn said.\n\nIntroduced by state Reps. Brett Hillyer (R-Uhrichsville) and Adam Holmes (R-Nashport), the bill prohibits the committee in charge of a statewide initiative or referendum petition from asking for or knowingly accepting money from a foreign entity or person. It also declares the bill as an emergency.\n\nIn a conference call with state Rep. Bill Seitz (R-Cincinnati), who seems to be the negotiating entity between the House and the Senate, he said that DeWine gave an hour and a half heads up to him about the special session order.\n\n\"These are snap decisions that have to be made sort of in a big hurry,\" Seitz said. \"Our original plan in the House was to have session on June 12 -- we wanted to give everybody plenty of notice so that they could rearrange their plans and rearranged to be in Columbus on June 12.\"\n\nFor an emergency clause, two-thirds of the representatives must vote yes. That is easily done in the Senate, considering that there would be 22 members and there are 26 Republicans in the chamber. In the House, one in which the GOP is fractured, an emergency would need 66 votes. There are 67 Republicans, and at least four refuse to vote for anything that helps Biden at all, according to Seitz. He doesn't think the Democrats would vote in favor of the foreign money ban, so he has to make sure that 66 Republicans not only show up but also support the bill.\n\n\"A number of our colleagues, quite a number of our colleagues, said that they would categorically refuse to vote for a bill that simply put Mr. Biden's name on the ballot,\" Seitz said. \"They're afraid of being tarred and feathered as loving Democrats if they do so.\"\n\nBut there are significant challenges with this. Bills must be heard on three separate days, and with the governor calling the session on Tuesday, that means the bill needs to be done and in committee the same day and then continued on Wednesday and Thursday. They must be done by then when their legal team advises them they must be done by Wednesday, and they don't even have the vehicle to get this done.\n\nThere is no way to suspend House rules since that would also require a two-thirds vote from the chambers, the lawmaker said.\n\n\"The fundamental difference between so far what the Senate wants to do and what we want to do is with the amount of words that the Senate is taking to do it, as opposed to a simpler strategy that that our legal counsel is recommending,\" he said. \"I keep urging both sides, 'Let's get past this argument over who gets to draft the bill.'\"\n\nIt is an understatement to say that Stephens and Huffman are political foes. Click here to learn more about the GOP infighting.\n\nWhen asked if the rivalry was playing into the debacle. Seitz said no. All the Democrats and every Republican spoken to -- other than Seitz, Stephens and Huffman -- said it is.\n\n\"Wouldn't it make more sense politically for the Republicans to want Biden to be on the ballot because if Biden isn't on the ballot, that could slow turnout for Trump?\" I asked Seitz.\n\n\"You're 100% correct,\" the Republican responded, noting that former President Donald Trump, U.S. Senator J.D. Vance, U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno and all Ohio GOP leaders want Biden to be on the ballot.\n\nThe special session should begin in the afternoon on Tuesday.\n\nThe DNC can announce early. Or the lawmakers can do something within a tight time frame that even Seitz seems nervous about.\n\nLawmakers have been suggesting Democrats can go to court to get the president on the ballot.\n\nCase Western Reserve University law professor Jonathan Entin said no court case would work. Learn more about his analysis here.\n\n\"What seems to be going on reflects yet again how dysfunctional the Ohio government is,\" Entin said. \"There's plenty of faults to be laid on just about everybody.\"\n\nYou can fault the Democrats for not knowing the law, the entire legislative leadership for being uncooperative and constantly bickering, and LaRose for \"waiting until virtually the last minute to raise the issue,\" the professor added.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that anybody could go broke underestimating the irresponsibility of Ohio officials dealing with this situation,\" Entin sighed.\n\nFollow WEWS statehouse reporter Morgan Trau on X and Facebook.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In 2020, the DNC's national convention was moved into an almost completely virtual format amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,\" DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nThe state legislature has since been deadlocked on moving to push the state deadline back, with the Ohio Senate convening for a special session to address it on Tuesday.\n\nA measure introduced by Senate Republicans, and called for by LaRose, to \"prohibit campaign spending by foreign nationals\" is at the center of the stalemate between the two chambers, which are held by Republicans.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nConcerns over foreign spending in Ohio's elections have grown after a ballot measure to enshrine abortion in the state's constitution received a boost from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss last year. The ballot measure passed and was a huge loss for Republicans as they continue to grapple with the issue following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nHowever, Republican state House Speaker Jason Stephen looked to pass a \"clean\" bill to allow Biden to be on the ballot by moving the ballot deadline to Aug. 23. Stephens refused to hold a vote on the Senate bill, and the House version stalled after it was informally passed, deadlocking both bills earlier this month.\n\n\"There's one person at this point who's responsible for keeping Joe Biden off the ballot in Ohio, and it's a Swiss billionaire you've probably never heard of,\" LaRose said in a statement on May 9. \"Democrats would rather protect Hansjorg Wyss than get Joe Biden on the statewide ballot, and their motives are clear. They've become dependent on Wyss's dark money to fund everything from their ballot campaigns to their fake news operations.\"\n\nCami Mondeaux contributed to this report.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Mike DeWine to come up with a state legislative solution to a deadline problem Biden faces with the DNC taking place after Ohio's candidate certification deadline.

The GOP-controlled Ohio House and Senate hit an impasse on a legislative solution that would have pushed back the deadline, as lawmakers have done for presidential candidates from both parties in the recent past.\n\nAntonio said legislative Democrats have tried in vein to negotiate a \"clean bill\" that does nothing more than allow Biden on the ballot. However, she said, Statehouse Republicans have continued to put \"poison pills\" in their proposals to do that, mostly focusing on tightening restrictions on ballot-issue campaigns.\n\nWithout a legislative solution, the issue appeared headed to court, where Republicans conceded that the Biden campaign was likely to succeed.

That committee vote is scheduled for June 4.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,\" Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee chairman, said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nOhio lawmakers, meanwhile, were gathering Tuesday for the special session.\n\nNegotiations between the House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nAnd the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nThe Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.\n\nShipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.\n\nWill 2024 voter turnout be the same as in the 2020 presidential election?

There is a precedent for this. A virtual roll call was held in 2020 because of the pandemic.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\" said Harrison, \"but when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.\"\n\nThis comes as the lawmakers in Ohio entered their first day of a special session called by the governor to fix this problem.\n\nWhat to know ahead of Ohio's special session to fix Biden ballot debacle\n\nRELATED: What to know ahead of Ohio's special session to fix Biden ballot debacle\n\nOhio requires parties to confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the Nov. election, which would be Aug. 7. But Biden won't be the official nominee until the Democratic National Convention, which is on Aug. 19.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nHere is a timeline.\n\nApril 5: LaRose's legal team emailed Statehouse Democratic leadership and Ohio Democratic Party Chairperson Liz Walters that there was \"an apparent conflict\" between the nominating deadline and the DNC event, according to an email I obtained.\n\nApril 6-16: For the following weeks, lawmakers went back and forth on what to do.\n\nApril 17: Ultimately, Republicans agreed to actively help the Democrats by making sure Biden was on the ballot.\n\nMay 7: A House committee passed their bipartisan ballot fix proposal out of committee.\n\nThey completely stripped and amended Senate Bill 92 making it a clean bill. It changed the nomination deadline to 74 days, which is Aug. 23. This would likely be a permanent fix. It also allowed for less formal declarations of candidate nomination.\n\nThe main reason why lawmakers often choose to amend bills at the last minute is due to timing. By revising an already passed piece of legislation, one that typically is ready to be passed by the second chamber, the lawmakers fast-track the process of getting it to the governor.\n\n\"It enables the notification to be a lot more flexible, whether it's email or whatever,\" Stephens said about his bill. \"This gives the flexibility.\"\n\nThis doesn't just help the Democrats, Stephens added.\n\n\"Just four years ago, we had this issue,\" the speaker said. \"The party in power in the White House usually goes last for the convention, so hopefully this will take care of that issue.\"\n\nRusso, who has a good relationship with Stephens, was pleased.\n\n\"I think everyone agreed this is good for democracy,\" Russo said. \"We want people to have full access to the ballot, and that's good for both parties.\"\n\nMay 8: The Senate passed H.B. 114 out of the chamber. It changed the nominating deadline from Aug. 7 to Aug. 23 -- but only for 2024, so it wasn't a permanent fix.\n\nThe lawmakers also added in S.B. 215, a campaign finance bill. In early March, Republican senators passed legislation meant to stop foreign donations to state and local ballot-issue campaigns. This could be by directly donating from outside the country or by donating to an entity, like a political action committee (PAC).\n\n\"Most Ohioans would agree that we shouldn't have foreign dollars affecting our ballot initiatives,\" Huffman said. \"Foreign money needs to be out of these statewide elections.\"\n\nThis addition was unacceptable to the Democrats, Antonio said.\n\n\"The language that has been embedded into 114 is yet another attempt to try to silence the voters of Ohio when they disagree with the supermajority of Republicans and go on their own to put together a ballot initiative,\" Antonio said.\n\nIt has provisions that could make it harder for grassroots movements to get on the ballot -- even with U.S. dollars.\n\nBiden ballot debacle continues in Ohio Statehouse as deadline passes\n\nRELATED: Biden ballot debacle continues in Ohio Statehouse as deadline passes\n\nIt would require all groups rallying for a cause that is receiving donations and spending money to register as a PAC. This means that groups would have to file disclosures with the government, and it could make it more difficult to collect signatures to get a proposal on a township ballot.\n\nThe bill also prohibits a lawful permanent U.S. resident, also known as a green card holder, from making contributions or expenditures regarding ballot issues or candidates.\n\nAll the Democrats voted no because of S.B. 215. Still, it passed 24-7.\n\n\"Republicans in both the House and the Senate aren't going to vote for a standalone Biden bill,\" Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said, defending why he put the bills all together.\n\nAcross the Statehouse, the House \"informally passed\" its version of the Biden fix, S.B. 92. This means it stays on the calendar but doesn't actually pass and isn't put up for a vote. It can be brought up for a vote at a later date.\n\nThe Senate sent over their bill to the House, who ignored it.\n\n\"We had those conversations and ended up not doing it today,\" Stephens said about not concurring.\n\nMay 20: House lawmakers introduced H.B. 609. The bill prohibits the committee in charge of a statewide initiative or referendum petition from asking for or knowingly accepting money from a foreign entity or person. It also declares the bill as an emergency.\n\nThis bill has bipartisan support, as it doesn't have significant negative impacts on local community members, House Minority Whip Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinnati) said.\n\nMay 22: When the Senate saw that the House wasn't taking their bait with H.B. 114, they amended yet another bill to further their elimination of foreign contributions in state ballot campaigns.\n\nH.B. 305, when it comes to campaign finance, does relatively the same as S.B. 215 and H.B. 114.\n\nMay 23: DeWine staged a surprise evening press conference, calling for a special session.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary situation when we have [a] ridiculous situation that we have not taken action to deal with a problem,\" DeWine said.\n\nSession will last from Tuesday through the special voting session on Thursday.\n\nSiding with the Senate, the governor urged the House to take up any of their three bills. However, his proclamation did state that legislators can also consider S.B. 92. He did not include H.B. 609, but the document states that lawmakers can review \"other similar legislation effectuating this purpose.\"\n\nWe agree with the Governor. It is time to protect Ohio's elections by outlawing foreign campaign contributions, while at the same time fixing the Democratic Party's error that kept Joe Biden off the November ballot. We encourage the Speaker and Minority Leader to allow a vote on House Bill 114 which does both.\n\nThe House leaders -- both Democrats like Isaacsohn and Republicans like Stephens -- continue to say that it isn't the foreign interference ban that they are rejecting; it is the new restrictions to access to the ballot for citizens.\n\nStephens says he is willing to compromise -- by making sure that a bill doesn't \"limit the rights of citizens to have their voices heard.\"\n\n\"For weeks, we have been pushing to find a legislative solution to having President Biden on the ballot. Ultimately, the will to do so wasn't there in the Republican caucus. Everyone agrees that we need to ban foreign political contributions from ballot issue campaigns in Ohio, and we have been driving towards a solution. We have language that has input from campaign finance experts and important interested parties to deal with the issue. This is language that squarely and directly bans foreign influence in Ohio's issue campaigns, while not also inadvertently limiting the rights of citizens to have their voices heard. We look forward to real solutions that will actually pass both chambers next week and solve problems.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\nFollow WEWS statehouse reporter Morgan Trau on Twitter and

Mike DeWine to resolve the issue.\n\nThe Democratic convention -- where the party traditionally nominates its candidates for president and vice president -- is scheduled after Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for certifying candidates. Ohio GOP lawmakers, who hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate, have been reluctant to pass a bill relaxing that deadline for Biden without a vote on unrelated campaign finance legislation that Democrats have described as a \"poison pill.\"\n\nDemocrats \"will land this plane on our own,\" DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement. \"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nThe DNC's rules and bylaws committee is expected to vote June 4 on a resolution to allow for the virtual roll call. DNC members will vote on the resolution in the following weeks and, once adopted, a virtual nomination process can proceed. Party officials are likening the approach to the virtual convention held in 2020 during the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign and DNC had for weeks resisted going forward with such plans. Ohio's certification deadlines have come before both parties' nominating conventions in the past, and in those instances, both parties resolved the issue cleanly, without rancor.\n\nBut in calling for the special session, DeWine requested that lawmakers tackle both a Biden ballot fix and a measure to ban foreign money in state ballot issue campaigns. The latter measure had been attached to a previous state Senate version of the Biden-related bill, but the state House never voted on it, triggering the scramble and DeWine's call for a special session.\n\n\"Once again, Republican politicians at the statehouse are playing politics with our democracy by trying to prevent Ohio voters from choosing who they want to be president, but Democrats will not trade Ohioans' ability to hold their government accountable for presidential ballot access,\" Liz Walters, the Ohio Democratic Party chair, said in a statement.\n\nNickie Antonio, the Democratic leader in the Ohio Senate, announced the change in strategy at a news conference Tuesday.\n\n\"The first thing we've done is we have asked the Biden campaign to issue a statement, which they will do today, assuring the people in the state of Ohio that Joe Biden will be on the ballot because they are going to go in an alternative direction to find a solution that does not include the Ohio Legislature,\" Antonio said.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person",

Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nDemocrats in both the House and the Senate want what they call a clean bill from the special session that deals only with changing state law to allow Biden to be on the ballot. Senate Republicans plan to stand on the recently passed Senate Bill 114, which puts Biden on the ballot but also takes action against foreign campaign contributions.\n\nThe House has not voted on SB114.\n\n\"We agree with the governor\" Senate Republican caucus spokesman John Fortney wrote on a blog \"It is time to protect Ohio's elections by outlawing foreign campaign contributions, while at the same time fixing the Democratic Party's error that kept Joe Biden off the November ballot. We encourage the Speaker and Minority Leader to allow a vote on House Bill 114 which does both.\"\n\nRepublican House leadership said they expect bills to be introduced Tuesday, hear public testimony Wednesday and likely vote Thursday. The House scheduled a session for 10 a.m. on Thursday.\n\nHouse Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, said there is an agreement to ban foreign political contributions and the House is moving toward a solution.\n\n\"For weeks, we have been pushing to find a legislative solution to having President Biden on the ballot,\" Stephens said. \"Ultimately, the will to do so wasn't there in the Republican caucus. We have language that has input from campaign finance experts and important interested parties to deal with the issue. This is language that squarely and directly bans foreign influence in Ohio's issue campaigns, while not also inadvertently limiting the rights of citizens to have their voices heard.\"\n\nLast month, Secretary of State Frank LaRose said state law and the timing of the Democratic National Convention were at odds. Ohio's deadline to certify candidate names is Aug. 7; the convention is Aug. 19-22 in Chicago.\n\nBiden clinched enough pledged delegates for the Democratic nomination in early March.", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@ktbs.com", "name": "Center Square", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_d_davidson@ktbs.com", "name": "J.D.

The Democratic convention is taking place August 19-22.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\" DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement Tuesday. \"But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.\"\n\nThe decision by the DNC comes after Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine last week called for a special session starting Tuesday to pass legislation to fix the ballot issue.\n\nThe DNC's plans were first reported by the Columbus Dispatch and the Washington Post.\n\nA virtual roll call would resolve an ongoing struggle between the Biden campaign and GOP officials in the Buckeye State. Last month, legal counsel for Ohio's Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose warned the campaign that the convention, when the party is expected to formally nominate Biden, will occur after the state's certification deadline.\n\nDemocrats held a remote vote before the convention during the pandemic in 2020. Under that process, delegates were sent individualized ballots, with all votes cast and counted before the convention officially began. During the convention, the party played a virtual roll call which featured videos and live shots from around the country.\n\nThe party is planning to formally introduce a resolution to allow for a virtual roll call next week, before sending the measure for a vote by the whole committee.\n\nIn previous cycles, early certification deadlines were resolved without much fanfare. States have either accepted provisional certification from the parties ahead of their conventions or passed legislation to move back the deadline to accommodate late conventions.\n\nEarlier this month, Alabama's Republican-led legislature moved back the deadline to clear the way for Biden to make the ballot there. Officials in Washington, which also has an earlier deadline than most states, said they would accept a provisional certification.\n\nOhio officials declined to accept a provisional certification and efforts to resolve the issue legislatively failed. State lawmakers in Ohio voted to move back the deadline ahead of the 2012 and 2020 party conventions.\n\nHolding a virtual roll call is one of several options Democrats weighed to keep Biden on the ballot. While holding part of the convention virtually could distract from the in-person activities, it is less contentious than a possible legal challenge. Legislative efforts failed after Ohio Republicans sought to extract concessions from Democrats.\n\nAnd while Ohio is no longer a presidential swing state - former President Donald Trump won there in 2020 by 8 points - Biden's presence on the ballot could be decisive in down ballot races, including Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown's reelection bid.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio lawmakers gathered Tuesday for a rare special session called by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to pass legislation ensuring President Joe Biden appears on the state's fall ballot.\n\nLegislators have done this before for Republicans as well as Democrats, but the ability of voters to speak directly through the ballot initiative process on questions such as abortion has made reaching a solution more difficult in both chambers, where the GOP has lopsided majorities.\n\nNegotiations between House and Senate on a solution to Biden's ballot conundrum began Friday. State Rep. Bill Seitz told reporters during a conference call that he and state Sen. Rob McColley, both Republicans, are leading the talks, with no resolution announced as of Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe legislation needs only to move Ohio's Aug. 7 ballot deadline so that it falls after the Democratic National Convention where Biden will be formally nominated, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-22, in Chicago. The Republican convention, in Milwaukee, is July 15-18, so it doesn't run afoul of Ohio's rules this year.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nBut the Senate sent its version of the ballot fix to the House after attaching a prohibition on foreign nationals donating to Ohio ballot campaigns, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDeWine urged legislators to pass the combination measure during the special session, but Democrats have balked, saying the proposal goes beyond the foreign nationals ban to add requirements intended to make it more difficult to mount future ballot campaigns in the state.\n\nThat's after Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved three ballot measures last year, including a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortions that Republicans opposed and an initiated statute legalizing adult-use marijuana.\n\nA \"clean\" House bill containing only the adjustment to Ohio's ballot deadline may also be considered.\n\nDue to differing interpretations of the proclamation DeWine issued Thursday, the Ohio Senate scheduled a single day of activity for Tuesday, while the Ohio House plans to begin with two days of committee hearings before taking its vote Thursday.\n\nA Senate spokesman has said it's possible the upper chamber can convene Tuesday and then recess to wait for the House.\n\nWill 2024 voter turnout be the same as in the 2020 presidential election?

Foreign money lie a power grab.", "body": "Ohio House of Representatives Minority Leader Allison Russo is serving her third term representing House District 7 which includes Upper Arlington, Grandview Heights, and portions of Columbus.\n\nAll of this discussion of whether President Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio or not makes for a juicy headline.\n\nBut, let's be clear: come November, Joe Biden will be on the ballot.\n\nWhat Ohioans need to be equally clear on is that extremist Republicans don't think that the average voter is very smart. They've shown over and over that they don't care what your values are and that they don't care what direction you think our great state should go.\n\nOhio Senate President Matt Huffman admitted that reality when he said the gerrymandered supermajority can, \"kind of do what we want.\"\n\nOnce you see it and, trust me, Ohioans have seen it a few times the past year, the playbook for extremists is obvious.\n\nThey use coded language and dog-whistle tactics as weapons to scare us. They did it last year with an August special election taxpayers had to pay for in the fight for abortion rights and the fundamental freedom for Ohioans to determine their own future.\n\nThey're doing it again using the so-called \"foreign money\" issue as a bargaining chip for the legislative fix to getting President Biden on the ballot.\n\nLETTERS: Republicans should be ashamed of their representatives and demand Biden be allowed on ballot\n\nFirst, let's get their \"foreign money\" lie out of the way. The truth is, any contribution of foreign money in our elections is already illegal under federal law, and these federal restrictions also apply to state campaigns.\n\nIt will likely surprise few who've been paying close attention to our Statehouse, that the urgency and intent of Gov. Mike DeWine's recent call for a special session have almost nothing to do with what should be an easy, bipartisan ballot fix or \"foreign money.\"\n\nInstead, these power-hungry politicians are once again attacking our fundamental freedoms and the people's right to hold their government accountable.\n\nThere was an agreed-upon plan by Democrats and Republicans for a clean, straightforward fix to getting Biden on the ballot, just as previous general assemblies have done in 2012 and 2020.\n\nWhen, some Senate and House Republicans saw an opportunity to use their gerrymandered power as a weapon to get what they want despite what the people want. Rep. Brian Stewart said the quiet part out loud tweeting that, \"any legislative fix for Biden should be paired with a GOP policy priority.\"\n\nThat \"priority\" is another attack on the people's right to challenge the government when the government is not responsive to what the people want. Citizen-led ballot initiatives are one of Ohio's most powerful democratic tools we have, and extremists are scared silly by it.\n\nThese sore losers-still licking their wounds after last November's Issue 1-are using the so-called \"foreign money\" lie to put a stranglehold on grassroots citizen-led ballot initiatives. Underneath that lie is a plan to take every group that ever tried to organize a ballot initiative and treat the group as a candidate for public office.\n\nThis ignores federal constitutional law, and it targets the voice of the people. For every citizen-led ballot initiative, extremist politicians are scheming to harass grassroots organizers and to use legal jujitsu to derail any citizen-led, Ohio organization before it can get going.\n\nIt's a giant scare tactic to target the citizen-led initiatives these politicians don't like.\n\nThe real truth: their plan is a preemptive strike against this year's citizen-led ballot initiative to reform the redistricting process in Ohio.\n\nGOP politicians know that the Citizens, Not Politicians reform, which is on-track to come before voters in November, will begin dismantling their gerrymandered, supermajority grip on power.\n\nThe same politicians embroiled in their own corrupt, dark money allegations will do anything to prevent accountability. That includes lying to you, changing the rules of the game, and attacking your basic fundamental freedoms.\n\nBlinded by power, Ohio's Statehouse extremists treat voters like naive children.\n\nDon't let them.\n\nThe people's fundamental freedoms are never open for negotiations. They tried to fool us before, and they failed. Let's make sure they fail again.\n\nOhio House of Representatives Minority Leader Allison Russo is serving her third term representing House District 7 which includes Upper Arlington, Grandview

The announcement came the same day the Ohio Legislature convened a special session at Gov. Mike DeWine's behest to get Biden on the ballot.\n\nA DNC committee will meet next week to greenlight virtual proceedings, and all members will vote on the change sometime after that. Democrats have not yet set a date for the roll call, which they also held virtually in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\" DNC chair Jaime Harrison said. \"But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own. Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.\"\n\nThe issue with Ohio's ballot surfaced in April when Secretary of State Frank LaRose told Democrats that the certification deadline is 12 days before the DNC. That left the party and Biden campaign with three options: Change convention procedures, sue Ohio or let state lawmakers move the deadline, as they have for past elections.\n\nAlabama and Washington faced the same problem and resolved it. The Alabama Legislature voted to change the deadline, while Washington's secretary of state agreed to provisionally certify Biden. Democrats also sought provisional certification in Ohio, but state officials struck down that idea.\n\nThe prospect of a legislative solution dimmed earlier this month when lawmakers deadlocked on a plan to change the certification date. While the Ohio House proposed a standalone Biden fix, Senate Republicans tacked on separate legislation to ban foreign citizens from contributing to state and local ballot issues. The House didn't vote on either bill.\n\nDemocrats contend the foreign money measure is a \"poison pill\" that will hinder citizen-initiated ballot campaigns. GOP lawmakers saw it as a tradeoff for helping the DNC and Biden campaign solve a problem of their own making. It's already illegal for foreign nationals give money to Ohio candidates or contribute to federal, state or local elections.\n\nFollowing inaction at the statehouse, a frustrated DeWine ordered lawmakers to return this week and address a Biden ballot fix and foreign campaign spending. But Democrats opted to pursue their own path in case lawmakers fail to reach a deal.\n\n\"In addition to being an unprecedented distraction, this petty partisanship is bound to fail,\" said Justin Levitt, a former Biden White House adviser and law professor at Loyola Marymount University. \"Both candidates will inevitably be on the ballot; the only real question is whether Ohio's legislators and secretary of state will feel any shame for lighting their constituents' tax dollars on fire in the meantime.\"\n\nHaley BeMiller is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves

Mike DeWine, also a Republican, had summoned the legislators to the special session last week, calling their inability to end the legislative gridlock \"ridiculous\" and \"absurd.\"\n\nOnly last week, the speaker of the Ohio House, Representative Jason Stephens was blunt about his inability to enact a quick fix for Mr. Biden's ballot problem.\n\n\"There's just not the will to do that from the legislature,\" he told reporters on Wednesday. \"It's a hyper-political environment at this time of year. And there are some Republicans who just didn't want to vote on it.\"\n\nThe chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Jaime Harrison, issued a statement on Tuesday denouncing the Republican lawmakers for their inaction. \"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\" he said. \"But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential nominating convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeWine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike DeWine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Stephens_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Stephens (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/28/multimedia/28nat-ohio-vclf/28nat-ohio-vclf-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604442", "eventUri": "eng-9604442", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-07", "textStart": 341, "textEnd": 347}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-19", "textStart": 465, "textEnd": 472}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Foreign money lie a power grab.", "body": "Ohio House of Representatives Minority Leader Allison Russo is serving her third term representing House District 7 which includes Upper Arlington, Grandview Heights, and portions of Columbus.\n\nAll of this discussion of whether President Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio or not makes for a juicy headline.\n\nBut, let's be clear: come November, Joe Biden will be on the ballot.\n\nWhat Ohioans need to be equally clear on is that extremist Republicans don't think that the average voter is very smart. They've shown over and over that they don't care what your values are and that they don't care what direction you think our great state should go.\n\nOhio Senate President Matt Huffman admitted that reality when he said the gerrymandered supermajority can, \"kind of do what we want.\"\n\nOnce you see it and, trust me, Ohioans have seen it a few times the past year, the playbook for extremists is obvious.\n\nThey use coded language and dog-whistle tactics as weapons to scare us. They did it last year with an August special election taxpayers had to pay for in the fight for abortion rights and the fundamental freedom for Ohioans to determine their own future.\n\nThey're doing it again using the so-called \"foreign money\" issue as a bargaining chip for the legislative fix to getting President Biden on the ballot.\n\nLETTERS: Republicans should be ashamed of their representatives and demand Biden be allowed on ballot\n\nFirst, let's get their \"foreign money\" lie out of the way. The truth is, any contribution of foreign money in our elections is already illegal under federal law, and these federal restrictions also apply to state campaigns.\n\nIt will likely surprise few who've been paying close attention to our Statehouse, that the urgency and intent of Gov. Mike DeWine's recent call for a special session have almost nothing to do with what should be an easy, bipartisan ballot fix or \"foreign money.\"\n\nInstead, these power-hungry politicians are once again attacking our fundamental freedoms and the people's right to hold their government accountable.\n\nThere was an agreed-upon plan by Democrats and Republicans for a clean, straightforward fix to getting Biden on the ballot, just as previous general assemblies have done in 2012 and 2020.\n\nWhen, some Senate and House Republicans saw an opportunity to use their gerrymandered power as a weapon to get what they want despite what the people want. Rep. Brian Stewart said the quiet part out loud tweeting that, \"any legislative fix for Biden should be paired with a GOP policy priority.\"\n\nThat \"priority\" is another attack on the people's right to challenge the government when the government is not responsive to what the people want. Citizen-led ballot initiatives are one of Ohio's most powerful democratic tools we have, and extremists are scared silly by it.\n\nThese sore losers-still licking their wounds after last November's Issue 1-are using the so-called \"foreign money\" lie to put a stranglehold on grassroots citizen-led ballot initiatives. Underneath that lie is a plan to take every group that ever tried to organize a ballot initiative and treat the group as a candidate for public office.\n\nThis ignores federal constitutional law, and it targets the voice of the people. For every citizen-led ballot initiative, extremist politicians are scheming to harass grassroots organizers and to use legal jujitsu to derail any citizen-led, Ohio organization before it can get going.\n\nIt's a giant scare tactic to target the citizen-led initiatives these politicians don't like.\n\nThe real truth: their plan is a preemptive strike against this year's citizen-led ballot initiative to reform the redistricting process in Ohio.\n\nGOP politicians know that the Citizens, Not Politicians reform, which is on-track to come before voters in November, will begin dismantling their gerrymandered, supermajority grip on power.\n\nThe same politicians embroiled in their own corrupt, dark money allegations will do anything to prevent accountability. That includes lying to you, changing the rules of the game, and attacking your basic fundamental freedoms.\n\nBlinded by power, Ohio's Statehouse extremists treat voters like naive children.\n\nDon't let them.\n\nThe people's fundamental freedoms are never open for negotiations. They tried to fool us before, and they failed. Let's make sure they fail again.", "source": {"uri": "cantonrep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canton Repository"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden",

Mike DeWine has recalled state legislators for a special session this week to try to change state ballot requirements. Talks between Democrats and Republicans before the regularly scheduled session ended in Columbus failed to reach a deal.\n\n\"Ohio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, the sitting president of the United States, on the ballot this fall,\" DeWine said last week. \"Failing to do so is simply unacceptable. This is ridiculous.

Here's the latest", "body": "The special session is a rarity in Ohio's history that is expected to last the duration of this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Ohio House unveiled two bills that curried favor among Republican leadership and dissent from Democrats. One of those bills would ban foreigners from contributing to statewide ballot initiatives (such as last year's Issue 1 campaign that enshrined abortion access into the state constitution) and another would make a temporary solution to allow Biden to get on the ballot.\n\nThe entire legislature is confined to these two topics alone for the remainder of this special session.\n\nThe Biden ballot topic has been a pressing issue for over a month now following Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose's message to the national Democratic Party that the incumbent president and Democratic nominee would be officially certified too late to comply with the state's election laws.\n\nState legislation needs only to move Ohio's Aug. 7 ballot deadline so that it falls after the Democratic National Convention where Biden will be formally nominated, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-22, in Chicago. The Republican convention, in Milwaukee, is July 15-18, so it doesn't run afoul of Ohio's rules this year.\n\nSince Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both leading parties. Each change was only temporary.\n\nState lawmakers tried making the necessary tweaks to state law that would ensure that Ohioans will get their choice between Biden and former President Donald Trump this November. But progress came to an abrupt halt over a week ago when Senate Republicans opted to roll in GOP priority legislation that would limit the impact foreign nationals could have in statewide ballot initiatives.\n\nState legislative leaders were at least lightly comforted by the idea that there were several other avenues to get Biden on the ballot. National Democrats could merely certify him within the window, or a federal lawsuit could be filed arguing that Ohio not including Biden on the ballot would be disenfranchising to millions of Democratic voters.\n\nDespite those safety nets, DeWine opted to force the issue by publicly reprimanding the legislature for passing the buck. He called it \"unacceptable\" that Biden wouldn't be on the ballot under current law and said his patience had run out.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nEditor's note: This is a developing story.

But the convention, in which Biden will be nominated, is scheduled for Aug. 9.\n\n\"As Ohio's chief elections officer, I refuse to bend the rules to benefit a candidate,\" LaRose wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. \"Critics allege that my decision to uphold the law will deprive Ohio voters of the opportunity to choose their president. Never mind that I didn't create this problem, nor do I wish for that outcome.\"\n\nGov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) called a special legislative session to get Biden on the ballot. The Ohio Legislature has until Thursday to approve an exemption to the rule.\n\n\"Ohio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, sitting president of the United States, on the ballot this fall,\" DeWine said. \"Failing to do so is simply not acceptable. This is ridiculous; this is an absurd situation.\"\n\nLaRose said a similar problem has happened twice with convention scheduling occurring before the Ohio deadline, but the legislature passed a temporary extension of the deadline for then-President Barack Obama and Sen. Mitt Romney in 2012 and then-President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nHe said it was Democrats who were in control of the Ohio House over a decade ago when they passed the election law, and he was frustrated that Republicans, who are now in control, must deal with the problem in the special session.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Unable so far to get a legislative fix to the problem they created, Democrats have flipped the script. They used to say refusing to enforce election rules was a threat to democracy; now refusing to bend the rules is a threat,\" LaRose wrote.\n\nLaRose remained firm that his hands were tied in the situation.\n\n\"I believe it's in voters' best interest to have a choice in the race for president, from Donald Trump in Colorado to Joe Biden in Ohio. But I'm also duty-bound to follow Ohio election law,\" LaRose wrote.\n\n\"For now, the law requires me to uphold a deadline the Democratic Party appears willing to miss. If as a result the Democratic candidates for U.S. president and vice president aren't on the statewide ballot, that's the party's choice, not mine,\" LaRose concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nEarlier this month, a similar situation occurred in Alabama, which has one of the earliest deadlines in the country. The Republican-controlled Alabama House unanimously voted to ensure Biden would be on the ballot.\n\n\"This is nothing new. We just need to fix this so the president can be on the ballot, just like our nominee can be on the ballot,\" Alabama House Speaker Pro Tem Chris Pringle, a Republican, said during the brief debate.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The DNC's move to hold virtual nominations bypasses the ballot access concerns in the state.\n\nThe Ohio Senate on Tuesday is considering two separate bills -- one to address Biden's ballot access and one introduced by Ohio Senate Republicans that would bar foreign sources from funding ballot issue campaigns. The latter is a direct response to GOP objections to the \"Issue 1\" campaign last year when Swiss billionaire Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss helped fund a ballot measure that enshrined abortion rights in the Ohio Constitution.\n\nDemocrats have objected to Ohio Republicans' efforts to vote push the two issues through during the special session, arguing that the GOP has made a legislative fix to address ballot certification -- a measure that has been granted to both parties in previous election cycles -- a political one.\n\nRead more: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ohio-lawmakers-convene-special-session-ensure-biden-2024/story?id=110608254", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansj\u00f6rg_Wyss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604442", "eventUri": "eng-9604442", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

They used to say refusing to enforce election rules was a threat to democracy; now refusing to bend the rules is a threat,\" LaRose wrote.\n\nLaRose remained firm that his hands were tied in the situation.\n\n\"I believe it's in voters' best interest to have a choice in the race for president, from Donald Trump in Colorado to Joe Biden in Ohio. But I'm also duty-bound to follow Ohio election law,\" LaRose wrote.\n\n\"For now, the law requires me to uphold a deadline the Democratic Party appears willing to miss. If as a result the Democratic candidates for U.S. president and vice president aren't on the statewide ballot, that's the party's choice, not mine,\" LaRose concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nEarlier this month, a similar situation occurred in Alabama, which has one of the earliest deadlines in the country. The Republican-controlled Alabama House unanimously voted to ensure Biden would be on the ballot.\n\n\"This is nothing new. We just need to fix this so the president can be on the ballot, just like our nominee can be on the ballot,\" Alabama House Speaker Pro Tem Chris Pringle, a Republican, said during the brief debate.",

The action was taken in spite of Ohio's special legislative session this week, which Governor Mike DeWine (R) claimed would address the matter.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\" DNC chair Jaime Harrison stated. \"But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.

Dani Isaacsohn (D-Cincinnati) said the Senate's version has unacceptable additions.\n\n\"The Senate Republicans decided, 'You know what? We want to extract a cost to get the president on the ballot,'\" Isaacsohn said.\n\nThis is \"anti-democratic,\" Isaacsohn, as well as dozens of other Democrats have said.\n\nThe lawmakers added in Senate Bill 215, a campaign finance bill. In early March, Republican senators passed legislation meant to stop foreign donations to state and local ballot-issue campaigns. This could be by directly donating from outside the country or by donating to an entity, like a political action committee (PAC).\n\nSenate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) explains this helps prevent interference.\n\n\"Most Ohioans would agree that we shouldn't have foreign dollars affecting our ballot initiatives,\" Huffman said.\n\nThat is a red herring, Isaacsohn argued, because the Senate proposal also has provisions that could make it harder for grassroots movements to get on the ballot -- even with U.S. dollars.\n\nIt would require all groups rallying for a cause that is receiving donations and spending money to register as a PAC. This means that groups would have to file disclosures with the government, and it could make it more difficult to collect signatures to get a proposal on a township ballot.\n\nThe bill also prohibits a lawful permanent U.S. resident, also known as a green card holder, from making contributions or expenditures regarding ballot issues or candidates.\n\n\"All of it is an attempt to make it harder to pass ballot initiatives in Ohio, which as you know, are the way in which voters -- in the most pure sense -- make their voice heard because it is direct democracy,\" Isaacsohn said.\n\nDemocrats in both the House and the Senate say that the Republicans who introduced this measure are just mad about their 2023 losses.\n\nAll three ballot proposals that passed last year were started because voters weren't happy with the state legislature and didn't feel like their voices were being heard. The August special election was proposed by lawmakers because they didn't want abortion to become legal -- a direct result of the angry voices of citizens.\n\nS. B. 215's bill sponsor, state Sen. Rob McColley (R-Napoleon), said in a previous interview that this wouldn't negatively impact the local advocates trying to get a stop sign.\n\n\"If you're going to collect and spend money in support of signature gathering, in support of a ballot initiative, you got to report your money,\" McColley said.\n\nLegislation like this is already in effect federally, and it also applies to candidates in Ohio -- just not ballot initiatives, so this is catching the law up, he added.\n\nDeWine agreed.\n\n\"I don't find it a very controversial issue,\" DeWine said. \"We should not have foreign nationals interfering and spending money in Ohio ballot races.\"\n\nThe governor is urging the House to concur on it, seemingly calling them irresponsible for their lack of action in the process.\n\n\"The House of Representatives has failed to do this -- the legislature had session yesterday and again failed to take any action,\" the governor said. \"This is simply unacceptable.\"\n\nHuffman also took a shot at the House in a statement:\n\nThe Senate President's spokesperson seemingly suggests that Minority Leader Allison Russo is preventing the bill from hitting the floor -- despite Stephens having a supermajority of Republicans. Stephens has been accused of being too close with the Democrats and allowing Russo to make decisions. The speaker has denied this, and so has Russo.\n\nThe House leaders -- both Democrats like Isaacsohn and Republicans like House Speaker Jason Stephens (R-Kitts Hill) -- continue to say that it isn't the foreign interference ban that they are rejecting; it is the new restrictions to access to the ballot for citizens.\n\nSpeaker Jason Stephens says he is willing to compromise -- by making sure that a bill doesn't \"limit the rights of citizens to have their voices heard.\"\n\nThe speaker is referencing H.B. 609, a new bill regarding foreign money, one without significant negative impacts on local community members, Isaacsohn said.\n\nIntroduced by state Reps. Brett Hillyer (R-Uhrichsville) and Adam Holmes (R-Nashport), the bill prohibits the committee in charge of a statewide initiative or referendum petition from asking for or knowingly accepting money from a foreign entity or person. It also declares the bill as an emergency.\n\nIn a conference call with state Rep. Bill Seitz (R-Cincinnati), who seems to be the negotiating entity between the House and the Senate, he said that DeWine gave an hour and a half heads up to him about the special session order.\n\n\"These are snap decisions that have to be made sort of in a big hurry,\" Seitz said. \"Our original plan in the House was to have session on June 12 -- we wanted to give everybody plenty of notice so that they could rearrange their plans and rearranged to be in Columbus on June 12.\"\n\nFor an emergency clause, two-thirds of the representatives must vote yes. That is easily done in the Senate, considering that there would be 22 members and there are 26 Republicans in the chamber. In the House, one in which the GOP is fractured, an emergency would need 66 votes. There are 67 Republicans, and at least four refuse to vote for anything that helps Biden at all, according to Seitz. He doesn't think the Democrats would vote in favor of the foreign money ban, so he has to make sure that 66 Republicans not only show up but also support the bill.\n\n\"A number of our colleagues, quite a number of our colleagues, said that they would categorically refuse to vote for a bill that simply put Mr. Biden's name on the ballot,\" Seitz said. \"They're afraid of being tarred and feathered as loving Democrats if they do so.\"\n\nBut there are significant challenges with this. Bills must be heard on three separate days, and with the governor calling the session on Tuesday, that means the bill needs to be done and in committee the same day and then continued on Wednesday and Thursday. They must be done by then when their legal team advises them they must be done by Wednesday, and they don't even have the vehicle to get this done.\n\nThere is no way to suspend House rules since that would also require a two-thirds vote from the chambers, the lawmaker said.\n\n\"The fundamental difference between so far what the Senate wants to do and what we want to do is with the amount of words that the Senate is taking to do it, as opposed to a simpler strategy that that our legal counsel is recommending,\" he said. \"I keep urging both sides, 'Let's get past this argument over who gets to draft the bill.'\"\n\nIt is an understatement to say that Stephens and Huffman are political foes. Click here to learn more about the GOP infighting.\n\nWhen asked if the rivalry was playing into the debacle. Seitz said no. All the Democrats and every Republican spoken to -- other than Seitz, Stephens and Huffman -- said it is.\n\n\"Wouldn't it make more sense politically for the Republicans to want Biden to be on the ballot because if Biden isn't on the ballot, that could slow turnout for Trump?\" I asked Seitz.\n\n\"You're 100% correct,\" the Republican responded, noting that former President Donald Trump, U.S. Senator J.D.

Because it's a computer-generated transcript, it contains many errors and misspellings.\n\nChris (00:01.996)\n\nAnd we're back on the Tuesday after Memorial Day with another episode of Today in Ohio. It's the news podcast discussion from cleveland .com and the Plain Dealer. I'm Chris Quinn here with Leila Tassi, Lisa Garvin and Laura Johnston. And Lisa today brings us an unprecedented moment. Mike DeWine's use of emergency powers in the Ohio constitution to call a special session of the legislature.\n\nIt's humiliating for the legislature because DeWine had to call a session to get them to do their job and fix the Ohio ballot, something these childish lawmakers refuse to do. Jeremy Pelser looked at the challenges of the next few days. What are they?\n\nLisa (00:44.23)\n\nYeah, there are several hurdles to easy passage of this law to put Biden on the ballot and you'd think it would be easy, but it won't be. Chief among them is disagreement between the House and Senate on whether they can consider existing laws in special session, which starts today, or do they have to start all over? The Ohio Constitution allows an emergency clause to make bills take effect immediately, but it's doubtful that there's the required two -thirds support in either chamber for this.\n\nThere's also an untested legal theory. A ballot fix would take effect 90 days after the new certification deadline, not the current deadline. But Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Governor DeWine says this could be challenged in court. There's also that poison pill or a couple of poison pills. There's one of them is to restrict foreign contributions to ballot issue campaigns. Republicans say this is a logical extension on the current ban for foreign money for candidate.\n\nraces. The Democrats say that this poison pill will affect future ballot issues. There's also a proposal that's added to this that would make it easier to appeal statewide temporary restraining orders issued by common police judges. We talked to a Republican from Cincinnati, Bill Seitz. He says lawmakers really have to take three days to pass a bill in a special session, but this current session is only today and tomorrow.\n\nBut if it's extended to Thursday, it would still be past the secretary of state deadline of passing a ballot fix by this Wednesday. Cite says there's a ghost of a chance to use the emergency clause. He says, because some Republicans will refuse to put Biden on the ballot, they're afraid of being tarred and feathered as loving Democrats.\n\nChris (02:29.932)\n\nYeah, that's the part that throws me is that they're willing to have a ridiculous unfair situation because they think it helps Democrats when really all it does is ensure democracy. Putting Biden on the ballot doesn't mean you support Biden or Democrats. You're doing the right thing. Ohio deserves the same choice as everybody else. But they're so wackadoodle because of gerrymandering. That's the way they think. Well, if I vote for this, I'm helping Democrats.\n\nLisa (03:18.534)\n\nWell, that quote from Seitz is really what threw me. It's like this is really showing how ludicrous this has become. It was an easy fix in 2010 and again in 2012 for both parties. Just fix it. Come on.\n\nChris (03:33.132)\n\nThey should shame anybody who votes against it. And actually we've talked about having a huge graphic, both online and in print after they vote with pictures showing exactly how everybody in this legislature votes, because anybody that votes against this clearly does not believe in democracy and they ought to be outed for the fools that they are. This should be unanimous. Everybody should vote for it. It should be a single issue. No games, no playing around, extend the deadline and do the right thing.\n\nWe'll see if they can do it. I'm betting that they can't because with Matt Huffman and Jason Stevens leading this, those guys have proven themselves completely incapable of getting their jobs done and they work against the citizens of Ohio with every breath they take. So I don't see it. I think this will fail and Mike DeWine will condemn them when it's over. You're listening to Today in Ohio.\n\nMore news about childish elected leaders. Jim Jordan is ranked as the least bipartisan member of Congress because of his constant prioritizing of his party over Ohioans. Who did the ranking? Laura and how does some others fare on this list?\n\nlaura (04:42.516)\n\nI bet you were super surprised that Jim Jordan was the least bipartisan, right? No, no. And Jim Jordan is proud of it. He says he didn't go to Congress to make laws. He went to fight bureaucracy and stand up for the freedom of Americans. So this comes from the Lugar Center and Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy. They've been doing their bipartisan index rankings since 2014. They look at both senators and House of Representatives and they...\n\ncount how they work across party lines on legislation, how often they introduce bills that attract co -sponsors from the other party, and how often they co -sponsor a bill on the other side of the aisle. Sherrod Brown ranked 39th for bipartisan in the Senate compared to JD Vance, 77th. So I mean, Vance is in the latter half of that. But of our good bipartisanship folks, it's Dave Joyce, South Russell in the US House.\n\nranked 15th nationally out of the 436 members. Mike Turner of Dayton was 26th. And I really like what Joyce said. He said, you know, you're elected by a party, you know, you're elected on a party. You run as a Republican, but he represents everyone in his district, whether or not they voted for him. So he wants to do the right thing for his district, which I really wish a lot of politicians followed that idea, ideal really of government.\n\nChris (06:08.108)\n\nThe idea that he's proud of never really working with the other side, it's called Congress for a reason. You come together to get things done and him saying, I'm here to fight for the people. You don't get anything done if you don't talk to others and work together on compromise. It's completely lost. It's just, I mean, we've had our own columnist write about it. I don't want them to compromise. I don't want them to pound their fists on the table. You'll have to compromise. That's the whole purpose of a Congress.\n\nlaura (06:37.076)\n\nRight. Otherwise, it's just super majority wins and that's not compromise and they're not representing all Ohioans and that's what we're sorry, all Americans in this case. But that's what we talk about in Ohio all the time, that they're not ruling for the people. They're doing what is best for their campaigns and their party. It can go through. There's a long list of how we got we went up from, you know, we talked about Joyce and then 61 Brad Wenstrup, Cincinnati Republican, not bad, all the way to 334.\n\nChantelle Brown as a Democrat is the second worst in Ohio for bipartisanship.\n\nChris (07:14.764)\n\nYou're listening to Today in Ohio. What is this organization that has state granted permission to take untold numbers of students out of the public schools for Bible studies and instruction on traditional values? Well, how does it fit into the state's requirements for hours spent in classrooms?\n\nLeila (07:33.262)\n\nNow, this is a Christian education nonprofit called LifeWise Academy that's based in suburban Columbus. And it has managed to get a growing handful of public schools to agree to let them take students off site to a Bible study program. Students, mostly in elementary school, leave school once a week for about 55 minutes during periods like music, art, physical education, and library classes.\n\nBut now Ohio lawmakers are considering changing the law to increase life -wise programs and others that are similar to it. An Ohio House bill would require school districts to adopt policies that allow students to leave for religious instruction. That's a change from the current law that permits school districts to pass such policies. This is apparently perfectly legal. The US Supreme Court has ruled that it doesn't violate the separation of church and state.\n\nbut a lot of parents and teachers are protesting this. There's a concern that if tons of kids are leaving the building for religious instruction, they're missing out on the important learning that happens in music, art, and physical education. LifeWise Academy has supporters who believe that this is an opportunity for kids to become grounded in the Bible and traditional values. But the detractors say that the program conflicts with many families' values in these more secular times.\n\nThey say it's a very exclusionary program. It doesn't accept modern families and LGBTQ plus people. It's too conservative and it robs kids of time that they should be spending learning in a regular classroom. And they see this bill as eroding the boundary between church and state.\n\nChris (09:12.524)\n\nYou know, I have a before you eviscerate me from about to say, hear me out. I have a different perspective than this. When I was a kid, I went to Catholic school for 12 years, so I didn't have to go to Sunday school. But many of my friends who went to public school every Sunday had to go to Sunday school and study the Bible and do all the stuff they did there. This group is arguing that in a modern world where parents are running around hither and yon because everybody's working and and.\n\nThey have limited time. Sports leagues like Laura's consume all of their weekends. That this is a way to get those values into their kids during the school day. And a parent has to sign off on this before a student can go. So I don't quite understand the furor about this. If a parent says, I'd rather my kid be in the religious class than in art or phys ed or what have you, shouldn't the parent be able to make that choice?\n\nLeila (10:09.55)\n\nI'm not going to eviscerate you on that point, actually. I actually don't care if other people want to take their kids out of school for whatever purpose. But I see the slippery slope. I think that there could be a risk that this turns into proselytizing the kids whose parents have opted out of this or that kids are going to feel excluded because they think something really fun is happening in these places. And I also do take issue with with kids being indoctrinated with intolerance.\n\nLisa (10:11.334)\n\nI actually don't care if other people want to take their kids out of school for whatever purpose. But I see the slippery slope. I think there's a severe risk that this is going to cross -validize the kids who have been out of this, or that kids are going to feel excluded because they do something really fun that's happening in these places. I also do take issue with kids being indoctrinated and intolerant for the LGBTQ community. If that's what you're saying,\n\nLeila (10:39.246)\n\nfor the LGBTQ community if that's what's happening. People can feel however they want, but the beauty of this youngest generation is that they're by and large are really loving and accepting one. And I would hate for a program to undo that on a large scale. It's the kind of thing that makes living in the world so much harder for a lot of people. And I'm also uncomfortable sending kids to some stranger's house for this, because it sounds like that is one of the options in some communities that kids go to somebody's home.\n\nLisa (10:41.24)\n\nwhat's happening. People can feel however they want, but the beauty of this youngest generation is that they're by and large a bit of nothing and accepting one. So I would make sure programming to undo that.\n\nIt's the kind of thing that makes the human world so much harder for a lot of people. And I'm also uncomfortable sending kids to some stranger in this house for this, because it sounds like that is one of the options in sub -unities, that kids go to somebody's home to learn stuff. Is the school district vouching for these people by allowing them to run the program?\n\nLeila (11:06.926)\n\nlearn stuff? Is the school district vouching for these people by allowing them to run the program? Is the district liable for anything that might happen to kids while they're offsite during the school day? So I have some unanswered questions like that. But I mean, as long as my child is not forced into this, as long as my tax dollars aren't paying for it, I don't have a true objection to this. And as long as we don't get to a point where one day they're asking us, like the next step better not be\n\nLisa (11:12.894)\n\nI mean, as long as my child is not forced into this, as long as my tax dollars are paying for it, I don't have a true objection to this. And then as long as we don't get to a point where one day they're asking us, like the next step better not be, the new laws that our tax dollars do have to pay for it, then I will take this.\n\nthe new law is that our tax dollars do have to pay for it, then I would take issue.\n\nChris (11:39.276)\n\nYeah, but that's, you know, that's not where it is. And I got to tell you, I never felt excluded from Sunday school. I was really grateful I didn't have to go.\n\nlaura (11:44.34)\n\nBecause it was on a weekend. Can I chime in? So this is coming, this came up because it's happening at my alma mater at Revere. And I want to be totally transparent that my sister's kids go there and she's been vocal in opposing it. And there's a petition out there with, I think about a thousand signatures, could be hundreds of signatures, people opposing it. I think the real issue is what Leila touched on, this plot.\n\nproselytizing and this exclusion, this idea that they have pizza parties and ice cream parties to get kids to want to go. So parents who are maybe ambivalent will give in to their kids and then they come back and they parrot what they've heard there and they are preaching intolerance. What they've said in their own literature is that they believe, you know, marriage is between a man and a woman and that they want these kids to go out and send that message. And, you know, school is hard enough.\n\nLisa (12:12.486)\n\nThis idea that they have pizza parties and ice cream parties to get kids to want to go so parents who are maybe ambivalent will give in to their kids and then they come back and they care what they've heard there and they are preaching intolerance. What they've said in their own literature is that they believe in marriages between a man and a woman and that they want these kids to go out and send that message. School is hard enough.\n\nlaura (12:40.916)\n\nwithout an outside organization causing fracture amongst the kids. And even though they're taking them out of music or art or whatever, that is going to create a huge headache for teachers and administrators, I would think, in trying to make logistics of elementary kids happen. It's already hard enough to get through a school day.\n\nLisa (12:41.062)\n\nwithout an outside organization causing fractures among the kids. And even though they're taking them out of music or art or whatever, that is going to create a huge headache for people who are administrators, I would think. And trying to make logistics and elementary kids happen, it's already hard enough to get to it.\n\nwant to defend that art and music are very important. And I don't want to diminish the importance of physical education, that too. But particularly those are critical, critical. They're not just throwaway classes or extra bonus periods. They're important.\n\nBut if the parent chooses that they'd rather their kid not do that and go to this, and Laura, if you put your kid in this because they wanted the ice cream, and they came home spouting off stuff that violated your family's values, you take them out. I mean, the parent is still the supreme on these things, and it's the family values that prevail. Go ahead, Lisa.\n\nLisa (13:40.518)\n\nNo, I just think for me, the litmus test would be if there are other programs like Lifewise that maybe preach the Torah or the Quran. I mean, are they going to accept those programs as well? I mean, they do say, well, you know, because they were accused of saying, well, you're just preaching the Bible, but they're saying, well, other groups can join. But can they really?\n\nIt feels like the way the law is written, it should, because it's for religious instruction. So it really should be for any religion.\n\nlaura (14:08.628)\n\nI agree, but they've been doing like, you know, I had to go to PSR as a kid. That's what we call CCD for Catholic education in Northeast Ohio. I, that was it's Monday nights. My kids go Sunday mornings. I mean, you know, plenty of kids that go to Hebrew school or whatever. It's never been taking them out of a public school where you, you know, you're putting your kids to go to school for the taxpayer public education.\n\nThe other thing I'm asking, so you mentioned Chris, how busy people's lives are and blah, blah, blah. Okay, so what's the busy part of the weekend? Like Laura, you said that your kids have done PSR and things, like that's all the weekend stuff. Are we saying then that their sports and all the soccer and all that stuff, that that's more important than religion, that you'd rather take them out of their school day for that?\n\nYou're questioning the parents' judgment, Leila. If the parent, if a\n\nLeila (15:00.302)\n\nNo, because I'm saying that you're trying to subordinate arts and music and all of those classes so that parents can plan out their weekend and have some fun.\n\nLisa (15:01.862)\n\nthat you're saying you're trying to subordinate arts and music and all of those classes so that parents can plan out their weekend and have some fun.\n\nChris (15:06.22)\n\nNo, I again, you're I'm saying I'm saying that a parent is choosing in a busy time of a parent says my schedule is too hectic to get them to Sunday school on the weekends. But if I have this option during the week, I'll take it because it's important to me. Who are you to say that art is more important to that parent? If that parent believes these values are the most important.\n\nthey can figure out something else. I don't understand the outrage about it because it's not costing anything. A parent has to sign off. A parent can always pull their kids out. There's no evidence that the schools are pushing it. So what's the harm of a parent making a choice for their child that you disagree with?\n\nLeila (15:54.35)\n\nI don't care. That's the only thing I'm concerned about. Okay, at the moment, this all seems cool. Do what you want. I don't care. But the second it becomes there's another foot in the door, then that all bets are off, man. I'm not giving any money. I don't wanna see these people at the school trying to recruit kids. That's it.\n\nOkay, you are listening to Today in Ohio. I knew that was going to be a good discussion. Are hospitals in Northeast Ohio and across the state violating laws about transparency and the cost of surgery? Lisa, one of the hardest things is when you learn you have to get surgery for something bad, trying to judge all the decisions you have to make on it. And if you can't get the dollars, you don't even know what it's going to cost you.\n\nLisa (16:42.79)\n\nYeah, there was a 2021 federal rule that required all hospitals to publicize the cost of 300 common surgical procedures, either using a user -friendly estimation tool or offering a computer readable file, I guess, similar to a PDF that researchers can use. But US PERG Educational Fund issued a report that found several Cleveland hospitals are non -compliant in offering these tools.\n\nAnd nationwide, only about 34 % of hospitals are fully compliant. So PIRG used an Ohio State student and a PIRG intern as a test patient looking for the cost of a complete knee replacement. They found that much of the information offered was incomplete. A lot of them didn't include physician or anesthesiologist charges in some of the hospitals, or they're not listing the prices at each location, which can vary widely via location.\n\nBut Metro Health and SUMA, which only offered one price across all their locations says, well, that's the same price everywhere. So Metro Health, the self -pay price for a knee replacement is $26 '324. That was the lowest. Cleveland Clinic, $65 ,000. Akron General Medical Center was only $3 ,000 in their machine readable file, but it was more money in the...\n\nestimator tool, but they say they're compliant. University hospitals in Beechwood, they said it was $42 '000 in the estimator tool, but only $12 ,000 in the machine readable file. So there's a whole bunch of discrepancies going on.\n\nChris (18:22.476)\n\nAnd I don't think any of that confusion is an accident. I think the hospitals try to get as much as they can in every case and keeping the prices confusing allows them to do that. It's the idea of let's push until it hurts and giving different prices if you have insurance versus not having insurance. The whole thing's a mess and you would have thought this law would have fixed it, but it's not fixed. And it really, you hear from people all the time.\n\nOne of our colleagues has been shopping around for services he needs and the price differences are astounding.\n\nLisa (18:56.294)\n\nAnd claims they're unaware of discrepancies between the tool and the machine readable file, but they also found in the report that physician costs were left off the calculator and that can add up to $10 '000 to the original price.\n\nChris (19:09.064)\n\nYeah, let's just leave pieces and parts off and confuse people even more. You're listening to Today in Ohio. We've got two courts now saying it flatly, but will the Ohio Supreme Court be the typical party hacks they've become and overturn it? How have two courts ruled that Ohio lawmakers broke their law with their sleazy budget bill shenanigans where they put a bucket list of new laws into the books without debate by adding them to the budget? Laura.\n\nlaura (19:38.356)\n\nRight. The idea is that it's illegal in Ohio to just cram all sorts of unrelated bills together. But I feel like we see it all the time. And what we're talking about specifically here is restricting the ability of health care facilities to solicit people involved in car crashes. So a three -judge panel at the 8th District Court of Appeals ruled that these are illegal riders that ran afoul of the state's one -subject rule, and that was the budget.\n\nAnd the Ohio Constitution says the bill can only address one subject and courts have previously held that the budget must be concerned only with the balancing of the state's expenses against its revenues. But three chiropractic clinics from across Ohio, including one in Cleveland, Allied Health and Chiropractic and a referral service that was contracted by the clinics filed this lawsuit. They first filed it in US District Court as well as in Cuyahoga Common Pleas Court.\n\nSo Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost argues that any defects in the law were fixed when lawmakers passed amendments to the budget. But the court's saying, no, the base rule was legal because it was a rider, and therefore you can't fix it with anything following that.\n\nChris (20:48.812)\n\nYeah, they've been doing this for years. I mean, we've talked about it and talked about it. It's odd that in just this one case, because somebody challenged it, it's become a big thing. Every budget bill is loaded with legislation that doesn't get debated. And it's usually pretty sleazy what they're trying to do. It's like a lame duck session where they pass a ton of stuff and you can figure out what it is. It's good to see the courts trying to hold it up as an example of that. I bet the Supreme Court...\n\noverturns it and comes up with some hocus pocus reasoning where it's loud.\n\nlaura (21:22.356)\n\nWhat's interesting is the court referred to the fact that they tried and failed to pass this before in 2018. It was less stringent restrictions on these ability to solicit potential customers, which sounds like something you'd want to do to protect Ohioans. But instead of just debating it and passing a law that everyone could agree on, they just shoved a more stringent version into the budget. And that's what the court's pointing to is like, clearly, you did this to get around.\n\nThey broke the law. That's that's what our legislators love to do is break the law. You're listening to Today in Ohio. Reporter Molly Wallace took a look at the strange journey this year's college graduates have been on and it is remarkable. Leila, what have they seen during their short four years?\n\nLeila (22:13.326)\n\nThese are the young people who came of age as the pandemic was taking hold in 2020. Their senior year in high school was interrupted. They missed out on the traditions of prom and graduation. They experienced a lot of isolation and loss. And during those years, the world just seemed to erupt. And while the pandemic continued to rage, we saw the Black Lives Matter movement take hold and the very important and consequential 2020 presidential election.\n\nand the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. And now as they're graduating from college, their own campuses are seeing protests over the Israeli Hamas war. So Molly spoke to some of these graduates. One of them shared how she had wanted to attend Otterbein University after graduating from St. Joseph Academy in Cleveland. But because of the pandemic, she stayed home with her mom and sisters and attended CSU. And she found it difficult to make friends until she joined a sorority her junior year.\n\nAnd then she lost her grandmother, the family's matriarch, to COVID. And so just a lot of heartache, but also just jubilance in her graduation. Another graduate spoke about how she had moved into her dorm on the Kent State campus in 2020 after graduating from Olin Tangie Orange High School in Delaware County. And she had one in -person class. And she was so grateful for it because nobody was in the dorm. She had no friends until...\n\nuntil classes started to open up and she feels like all of these experiences have really united the generation and have helped put a premium on friendship and relationship. And that seems to be the universal theme of these stories. They've come of age in the crucible amidst a great deal of social upheaval and it's really made them tough and less likely to take anything or anyone for granted.\n\nChris (24:01.004)\n\nI think previous college classes have seen social people, but not in a century has anybody seen what the pandemic did. I just, the pandemic is such a game changer for our lifestyles in this country that I can't imagine any other class will have a similar experience unless we have another pandemic and even then probably wouldn't be the same. It's interesting to take a look at the everything they've been through in the four years though.\n\nYou're listening to Today in Ohio. The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District just released some of its plans for Lower Lake, which is no longer a lake because of a failing dam. Lisa, what does Steve Litt think of what he has seen so far and what warnings does he offer for the rest of the planning?\n\nLisa (24:47.974)\n\nI think the take home message from Steve's article is that this planning requires serious consideration of urban design and aesthetics, landscaping and everything else in addition to civil engineering. As we know from the draining of Horseshoe Lake, people are highly emotional about the Shaker Lake, so they have to proceed with caution. But again, they do have to, you know, mitigate flooding from Doanbrook, which floods a lot.\n\nSo the sewer district presented preliminary plans for replacing the 177 year old earthen dam at Lower Lake in an online presentation in two public meetings. And the next round of feedback will be in September. And again, this is part of a larger effort to prevent surface runoff flooding in the Dome Brook watershed. So the Lower Lake dam is an 18 acre basin in a very heavily developed area with a lot of impermeable services.\n\nand that sends sheets of water into Dome Brook. One of the worst flooding incidents was in 1959. And fun fact, I was a witness to that, but I was less than two years old, so I don't remember it. But we've had flooding as recently as 2018 and 2021 in University Circle, because that water just runs right down the hill. So the plans call for the current spillway to rebuild.\n\nbe rebuilt in historical style. And then they're proposing a second spillway with a concrete structure that will extend into the lake. They're talking about erecting flood walls near the dam to control flows. And there's no detailed design on these walls yet, but they're envisioning eight feet above ground level at the lowest point. And then it would include a gate to accommodate the loop trail that would go through that area that would close during a heavy flood. So.\n\nAnd there's talk about, you know, the aesthetics, the view will change. They're going to try and squeeze it into a tight corner by North Park Boulevard. So there are a lot of things to consider.\n\nChris (26:41.612)\n\nSteve rightly criticizes the idea of walls that would block the view of this natural area. I hope that the redesign gets rid of that. If you suddenly have walls blocking your view of that whole expanse, then I think the aesthetics fall apart. That was a surprise in Steve's look, and I think it's part of the reason for his alarm.\n\nLisa (27:06.086)\n\nAnd there are a lot of questions that are still unresolved. Did they have to dredge the lake? Will they include canoe kayak launch points? How are they going to replace the parking that will be lost along Brook Road when the dam is taken out? And a whole bunch of other stuff. But they are listening. They're having a second round of feedback. So it'll be interesting to see what people say and how they react.\n\nChris (27:26.604)\n\nYou're listening to Today in Ohio. Amid all the discussion about a renovate or new Brown Stadium as well as a proposal for a publicly owned stadium for women's professional soccer, report Courtney Astoffi looked at the traditional funding sources and how locked up they are just to create a baseline. Layla, what do we know?\n\nLeila (27:46.318)\n\nYeah, we wanted to take a look at all our local tax revenues to see what could possibly be available for these teams. And it looks like we're pretty much maxed out. Cleveland has a 3 % bed tax and a $6 car rental tax. They can't go any higher under Ohio law. Likewise, the county's voter approved excise tax on alcohol and cigarettes. We know this as the syntax. That's also maxed out under state law. This is the only source of local revenue that's exclusively set aside for\n\nCleveland's three professional sports teams, but these can't even cover the current expenses that they're earmarked for. We have a Cleveland has a parking tax. It's 8 % for public paid parking lots. This was set up in the nineties by city council and it was a pretty big piece of the puzzle in funding the construction of the existing stadium. An Ohio law passed that same year that placed a cap at 8 % which remains in place today. So that's maxed out. We have the county bed tax at six and a half percent. It's also\n\npretty much maxed out under state limitations. The generic state imposed cap is 6%. Kyga County can't exceed the cap because of a vote by the commissioners in the 90s that took advantage of a brief window to impose a one and a half percent increase for the rock hall. State law requires most bed tax proceeds to be set aside for convention centers and visitor bureaus, though a portion of the money flows to the general funds for the county and cities and can be used for capital upgrades. So in other words,\n\nCounty bed tax as it stands is stretched thin, accounted for. So we do have a little bit of wiggle room in Cleveland's 8 % admissions tax for theater performances, professional sports games and other events. State law limits that tax at 10%. So Cleveland could increase that with a vote of city council, but that is pretty unlikely in Cleveland. And there's also an 8 % county sales tax. Of that, 5 .75 goes to the state.\n\n1 % feeds routine county services and RTA gets 1%. There's also that quarter percent baked in there that's supposed to pay for the jail construction. Cuyahoga County could raise the sales tax an additional quarter percent under current state law, but good luck convincing the county to do that for stadiums. Cuyahoga County already has the highest sales tax in the state.\n\nChris (30:10.188)\n\nYeah, this really does demonstrate that the current system that we use is tapped out and doesn't really work. I do want to say we're weeks away from publishing a thought exercise that will change the way people think about this and may offer some solutions or at least get a conversation started, but I'm going to be cryptic and say no more. You're listening to Today in Ohio. That's it for the Tuesday episode. Thanks, Leila. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Laura. Thank you for listening.

party will now virtually nominate Mr Biden ahead of the convention.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.\"\n\nHeld in a presidential election year, party conventions take place during the summer over three days of pomp and pageantry.\n\nA party convention typically culminates with an in-person roll call of every US state and territory nominating their choice of candidate, which is determined by how many votes the individual earned in a preceding primary contest.\n\nThe candidate is formally certified as the party nominee on the final day.\n\nIn 2020, the Democratic and Republican conventions were largely virtual affairs because of Covid-19 restrictions on social gatherings.\n\nEach party had planned to return to a more extravagant format this year.\n\nRepublicans will gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from 15 to 18 July to re-nominate former President Donald Trump, while Democrats will meet in Chicago, Illinois from 19 to 22 August to select Mr Biden again.\n\nThe party that holds the White House - in this case the Democrats - typically holds its convention after the opposing party's event, but Ohio's Republican elections chief had warned in April that the DNC event falls foul of state election laws.\n\nOhio requires political parties to officially confirm their presidential and vice-presidential nominees to the elections chief 90 or more days before the early November general election.\n\nIn a letter earlier this month to state Democrats, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said he was \"duty-bound to instruct boards of elections to begin preparing ballots\" that did not include the names of Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\nSuch conflicts have been resolved with little drama in the past, with Ohio itself making exceptions for Mr Trump in 2020 and Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee.\n\nThis year, Democrats in Washington state and Republicans in Alabama made the provisional changes necessary to exempt Mr Biden from ballot deadlines.\n\nBut Republicans in the Ohio state legislature expressed opposition to such a solution this year, with the House Speaker quoted as saying \"there's just not the will do that\".\n\nLawmakers were called into a special legislative session at the state capitol on Tuesday by Governor Mike DeWine, a moderate Republican who has urged an end to the \"absurd situation\".\n\nBut as the session began, doubts remained over whether the body would implement its own fix, and Democrats told US media they were taking matters into their own hands.\n\n\"Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice,\" Mr Harrison said in his Tuesday statement.\n\nIt remains unclear when the roll call will take place and whether it will involve every single state and territory.\n\nOhio, once viewed as a swing state, has become increasingly conservative.\n\nMr Trump won Ohio in both 2016 and 2020, defeating Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden by roughly 8% margins on each occasion.\n\nThe fight over Ohio's ballot comes after another partisan clash earlier this year - one that threatened Mr Trump's ballot appearance.\n\nOfficials in Colorado, Illinois and Maine ruled that the Republican was barred from returning to the White House under a Civil War-era insurrection clause in the US Constitution.\n\nThe US Supreme Court ultimately knocked down that decision in March, ruling that Mr Trump must be placed on the three states' presidential ballots.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Lima Republican didn't hesitate to draft a plan that would subvert the sovereignty of voters (and direct democracy) and roll it into a simple ballot fix. Huffman's nemesis, Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens, didn't hesitate to crater the Senate legislation and ditch a clean ballot resolution to certify Biden for the general election because \"why create a stir that's not necessary.\" Why??\n\n*snip*", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One-party state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerrymandering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Stephens_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Stephens (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Direct democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604442", "eventUri": "eng-9604442", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

It has the full-throated support of that state's GOP-controlled legislature -- and now, apparently, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.\n\nStung by their failed attempt last August to stymie the ability of Ohio citizens to pass a referendum enshrining abortion rights in the state's constitution, and still smarting at the subsequent success of Ohioans in passing a ballot initiative that did exactly that, Ohio Republicans are now employing a strategy designed to prevent a repeat.\n\nThey are attempting to draft a new law restricting citizen initiatives such as the 2023 abortion referendum, in exchange for allowing President Joe Biden to be listed on Ohioans' ballot this November. They are also attempting to condition Biden's access to the ballot on passage of a law that would allow the Ohio Supreme Court to more swiftly impose new abortion restrictions. This is foisted by the state's Republican legislature, despite the passage of that pro-choice constitutional amendment last fall.\n\nNot coincidentally, what they are proposing is the work of Christian activist organizations who see an opportunity to reinstate their anti-abortion agenda on unsuspecting Ohio citizens. Their efforts are also being championed by the state's Republican senator, J.D. Vance, and his colleague, Bernie Moreno, who is challenging Democrat Sherrod Brown for the state's other Senate seat. Last week, DeWine signed onto these efforts by his GOP colleagues, calling for a special session of the Ohio legislature, set to begin on Tuesday, with a vote expected later this week.\n\nhttps://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/5/28/2242997/-Ohio-GOP-will-only-let-Biden-on-the-ballot-if-they-can-restrict-abortion", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeWine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike DeWine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Ohio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Ohio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classes of United States senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on their own,' Harrison said.\n\n'Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice,' the DNC chair also offered.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden participate in the 2020 Democratic National Convention that was held almost completely virtually. He'll again be nominated virtually due to in-person convention scheduled for after Ohio's ballot deadline\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said Tuesday that a 'virtual roll call' vote would take place to nominate Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over fears that GOP 'incompetence or partisan tricks' could keep the Democrats off the ballot in Ohio\n\nIn the past, Ohio state legislators have moved the deadline to accommodate candidates of both parties.\n\nOhio's Republican Gov. Mike DeWine had called a special session of the state House and Senate this week to address the issue, but so far lawmakers remained at an impasse.\n\nFour years ago, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the Democratic National Convention was held virtually.\n\nLargescale plans to take over Milwaukee, Wisconsin were scrapped with Biden instead accepting the party's nomination from his adopted hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nThis year, Republicans are having their convention in Milwaukee while Democrats will host their convention in Chicago.\n\nA roll call vote on the convention floor will still occur but it will be held symbolically.\n\nPresident Joe Biden lost Ohio to former President Donald Trump in 2020 but still won enough Electoral College votes to win the presidency. The last Democrat to win the Buckeye State was former President Barack Obama. Biden served as Obama's running mate\n\nThe virtual roll call vote is expected to take place after June 4, when the DNC's rules and bylaws committee will meet and vote to make changes to the roll call process - allowing the virtual roll call plan to go forward.\n\nFor years Ohio was a key battleground state during presidential elections, but it's become more GOP-friendly in recent cycles.\n\nDemocratic President Barack Obama won Ohio in 2012, helping clinch his reelection bid.\n\nBiden was Obama's running mate.\n\nTrump has been victorious in the state two times since.\n\nIn 2020, Ohio went 53 percent for Trump and 45 percent for Biden.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A second video, exclusively obtained by the Manchester Evening News, showed violent scenes which erupted in the moments before the incident - with Mr Amaaz and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, 25, appearing to throw punches at a male police officer.\n\nThe family allege that the brothers' mum, Shameem Akhtar, 56, was also left bruised after being hit in the face with a Taser. The IOPC says it is making 'progress' with its investigation into the incident, and the latest complaint will form part of its probe into GMP's actions.\n\nAn IOPC spokesperson said: \"These [complaints] relate to the level of care provided to a woman who reported she received an injury during the arrests and a young child present at the time; the language and level of force used by police towards two of the men who were arrested; and the men's subsequent detention in custody.\"\n\nThe watchdog has obtained body-worn video footage from officers and CCTV from the airport, as well as footage shared by the public. As part of the investigation, the IOPC says it is considering:\n\nthe force used against three members of the public, two men and a woman, who were part of an initial incident near the car park pay machines, during which the two men were arrested the force used by officers in relation to three other members of the public during an incident shortly afterwards, during which two men were arrested and one of the individuals was PAVA sprayed whether the response, actions and decisions made by the officers were in line with local and national police policies and procedures.\n\nIt will also give 'due regard' to any indication that discriminatory behaviour may have influenced the treatment received by those involved - plus the allegations raised in complaints. Another GMP officer was informed they were under criminal investigation for assault on July 26, in connection with the first arrests made at Manchester Airport on the same day.\n\nThe IOPC's spokesperson added: \"The serving of notices does not necessarily mean criminal charges or misconduct proceedings will follow. At the end of our investigation we will decide whether to refer the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision and decide whether the officer should face disciplinary proceedings.\n\n\"We have met with family members of some of the men present during the incident to explain our role and gather information. And earlier this week, we met with members of the local community to better understand their concerns and share what information we can about the investigation so far.\"\n\nAt a press conference this week, lawyer Aamer Anwar said the family involved in the altercation had been racially abused on a Qatar Airways flight back from Pakistan moments earlier. A man sitting in the row behind had subjected her to a 'tirade of alleged racist abuse' and called her a 'P*** b****', he claimed.\n\nMs Akhtar asked the man to calm down, but he continued to abuse and 'bully' her for several hours, Mr Anwar alleged. When she left the aircraft, Mr Anwar alleged the man 'used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her'. The M.E.N. has approached Qatar Airways for comment.\n\nGMP previously stated that three officers were subject to a violent assault and punched to the ground, while a female officer suffered a broken nose, during the Manchester Airport incident. It also claimed there was a 'clear risk' of firearms being taken from officers.\n\nA spokesperson for GMP said: \"Investigations into incidents that occurred at Manchester Airport on July 23 are ongoing, we are fully cooperating with the independent investigation reviewing police conduct, whilst actively pursuing lines of enquiry into three incidents. We have obtained all relevant CCTV footage and are continuing to appeal for witnesses.\n\n\"If you have any information or footage to support the police investigation, submit it through GMP's public

These investigations are separate, and we are liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service to establish how they can progress in parallel.\n\n\"We are grateful to those who have assisted our investigation so far and we continue to gather and review substantial amounts of evidence. We are aware that more evidence is in the public realm and we continue to encourage people to contact our incident line with any relevant information.\"\n\nWe have obtained body-worn video footage from officers in attendance, and reviewed a substantial amount of CCTV footage from inside and outside the airport terminal. We are also reviewing footage shared by the public via our dedicated reporting line, as well as on social media.\n\nOur investigation will consider all of the circumstances of the incident including:\n\nDuring the course of this investigation, due regard will be given to whether there is an indication that discriminatory behaviour may have influenced the treatment received.\n\nAs part of the investigation, we will also consider the allegations raised in complaints from those affected. These relate to the level of care provided to a woman who reported she received an injury during the arrests and a young child present at the time; the language and level of force used by police towards two of the men who were arrested; and the men's subsequent detention in custody.\n\nAny further referrals will be assessed in the usual way and could be included in our investigation.\n\nOn Friday 26 July we announced that a GMP police constable was under criminal investigation for assault in connection with the first arrests made at Manchester Airport on the same day.\n\nA second GMP officer has since been advised they are under criminal investigation for assault relating to an incident in which two other men were arrested. They are also being investigated for potential gross misconduct for alleged breaches of police professional standards including their use of force.\n\nThe serving of notices does not necessarily mean criminal charges or misconduct proceedings will follow. At the end of our investigation we will decide whether to refer the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision and decide whether the officer should face disciplinary proceedings.\n\nWe have met with family members of some of the men present during the incident to explain our role and gather information.

Four men were subsequently arrested in connection with the incident.\n\nAlso, a CT scan after he was kicked in the head by a police officer revealed that Fahir was found to have a cyst on his brain.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Office_for_Police_Conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent Office for Police Conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use of force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urdu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/08/09/thumbs_b_c_72e9c273e09712f9a60b0f7463bea06b.jpg?v=075508", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801508", "eventUri": "eng-9801508", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The Manchester Evening News can now reveal new details of two separate inquiries.\n\nThe first involves five officers and stems from alleged 'canteen' banter. One element of that investigation includes recordings of alleged behaviour.\n\nFive officers have been suspended. The police watchdog - the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) - is taking the lead on that inquiry. Two others officers are on restricted duties for other matters.\n\nREAD MORE: Police issue update after man 'chases car with hedge trimmer' at petrol station\n\nIn a second investigation, relating to alleged incidents while off duty, eight officers have been suspended. That case is being investigated internally by GMP's Professional Standards Directorate.\n\nIn a statement issued last July in relation to the first inquiry, Greater Manchester Police said: \"We've suspended five officers and put two officers on restricted duties on the Bury district following a report made of racial discrimination.\n\n\"GMP has a zero tolerance on discriminatory behaviour from any of our officers and staff. We are deeply concerned by the allegations and will not hesitate to take any action necessary. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) are independently investigating following our referral.\"\n\nIn relation to that case, the IOPC said it had begun an investigation 'following a referral regarding the conduct of Greater Manchester Police officers who are alleged to have engaged in conversations of a discriminatory nature'.\n\nIt added: \"We will investigate allegations that these officers openly engaged in conversations and either used, or failed to challenge, offensive language. We began an independent investigation on Thursday 4 July following a conduct referral from the force the day before. We are reviewing the available material and will notify the officers of their status in our investigation.\"\n\nIOPC regional director, Catherine Bates, said: \"Officers are expected to maintain exemplary standards of conduct and professionalism. This type of behaviour has the potential to undermine the public's confidence and trust in policing, in addition to the impact it has on officers who conduct themselves with integrity.\n\n\"We will conduct a thorough investigation to establish the evidence and ensure any discriminatory behaviour is dealt with appropriately. This does not necessarily mean conduct proceedings or criminal charges will follow and the status of all officers will remain under review throughout the investigation.''\n\nIn the second inquiry, GMP has suspended eight of its officers after a 'racial discrimination' report was made. Another officer was put on restricted duties. The force said it has temporarily relocated officers to Bury to 'cover operational duties and minimise disruption within the district'.\n\n\"Today (Monday 29 July 2024), we have suspended eight officers and restricted one officer following a report made of racial discrimination,\" a statement read. \"This follows the force suspending five officers and placing two officers on restricted duties; all from the Bury district on 17/07/2024.\"\n\nHead of GMP's professional Standards Directorate Detective Chief Superintendent Mike Allen said: \"The reports we have received are deeply concerning and I hope to reassure the community of Bury, the wider public, and the GMP workforce that a full and thorough investigation is being conducted into these matters.\"\n\nCommenting on the second inquiry the IOPC said: \"We received a mandatory conduct referral from Greater Manchester Police on 18 July relating to allegations of discriminatory behaviour, We determined an investigation was required and instructed GMP to carry this out.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neal_keeling@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Neal Keeling", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racial discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Office_for_Police_Conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent Office for Police Conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bury,_Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bury, Greater Manchester"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_metropolitan_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gross metropolitan product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_superintendent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief superintendent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27716955.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS310948950.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801508", "eventUri": "eng-9801508", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1851, "textEnd": 1857}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 3689, "textEnd": 3696}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

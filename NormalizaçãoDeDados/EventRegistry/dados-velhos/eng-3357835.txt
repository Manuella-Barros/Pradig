bootcamp for youth offenders at the country's main army camp, training alongside regular soldiers.\n\nMaking the announcement in Auckland, Bill English said the ruling National Party would crack down on the most serious young offenders and hold \"negligent parents\" to account.\n\n\"It's become clear that there is a small group of around 150 very serious young offenders for whom our youth justice system in its current form just doesn't work,\" Mr English said.\n\n\"These are 14- to 17-year-olds who've committed very serious offences with sentences up to 14 years - that is serious assault, sexual assaults, aggravated robbery and murder.\n\n\"The kind of offences that have made people feel unsafe in their [shops], in their workplaces and that's not good enough for us or for New Zealand.\"\n\nIn a move to reaffirm National as the \"law and order party\", Mr English announced a $NZ60m ($43m) package to deal with the most violent and recidivist young offenders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Justice Minister, Amy Adams, laid out the details of the proposal.\n\n\"We will introduce a Young Serious Offender (YSO) classification which will see this very small group of the most hardened young offenders dealt with in ways that better reflect the seriousness of their crimes and help ensure fewer people are victimised.\n\nYou will now receive updates

The academy will support YSOs to address problems like addiction or a lack of literacy and numeracy skills, helping them lead better lives while keeping the public safe.\n\n\"Those who fail to complete their time at the academy will serve a commensurate adult sentence of imprisonment instead,\" she said.\n\n\"These are young people who have been in and out of youth court but have shown no willingness or ability to change their behaviour. We are not prepared to just sit back and allow their victims to keep racking up until they reach adulthood.\"\n\nNational estimated about 50 serious youth offenders per year, would be sent to the bootcamp. That scheme would cost about $NZ30 million over four years.\n\nOther changes under the YSO classification would include tightening bail requirements, increasing the use of electronic monitoring, and removing the ability for the most serious young offenders to be released early from any youth justice custodial sentences.\n\nA new National government would also look at the role parents played in their children's spiral to an early life of crime.\n\n\"In many cases, young people who offend have few good role models or are given the freedom to commit crimes,\" Ms Adams said.\n\n\"We will make changes to hold their parents to account, including by allowing police to issue instant infringement notices to parents of children under 14 walking the streets without supervision between 12am and 5am.\n\n\"In addition, any breaches of court orders directed at a young person's parent will be recorded on that parent's criminal record.

year off to a boot camp at Waiouru where the army can drum some discipline into them.\n\nThe \"Junior Training Academy\" will be part of $30 million spent over four years on a new class of criminal the party wants to call \"Young Serious Offender\".\n\n\"There remains a small group of around 150 young people who continue to commit large numbers of serious offences,\" justice spokeswoman Amy Adams, who is also justice minister, said.\n\n\"These are young people who have been in and out of Youth Court but have shown no willingness or ability to change their behaviour.\"\n\nJudges would be able to send the worst young offenders to Waiouru for one year to deal with problems like addiction or a lack of literacy and numeracy skills.\n\nThose who failed to complete their time at Waiouru Military Camp would serve the balance in jail.\n\nThe YSO classification would come with tightened bail requirements, increased electronic monitoring and removing any early release from custodial sentences.\n\nIt was estimated that 50 youths would be sent to Waiouru each year and the scheme would need about $30m over four years.\n\nOther law changes would \"hold their parents to account\", Ms Adams said.\n\nPolice would be allowed to issue instant infringement notices to parents of children under 14 walking the streets without supervision between 12am and 5am.\n\nBreaches of court orders directed at a young person's parent would be recorded on that parent's criminal record, closing a current loophole, Ms Adams said.\n\nNational would also set up a contestable $30m fund for community groups to support programmes to reduce offending.\n\n\"We know local solutions are often the best, and we want to give smaller or rural communities the opportunity to take further action,\" Ms Adams said.\n\nThe Government has funded boot camps for young people since the 1980s, including some operated by private providers.\n\nIn an interview with TVNZ's SUNDAY programme on 25 July, Social Development Minister Anne Tolley acknowledged that state-funded boot camps often haven't worked.\n\n\"There are some cases where the idea that you take young people and you give them a short, sharp jolt about what life is really like hasn't actually been particularly effective,\" she said.\n\n\"And if you haven't got sufficient oversight, then children can actually suffer physical harm, or certainly emotional harm, as a result.\"\n\nHundreds of young people were sent to the Whakapakari boot camp on Great Barrier Island, which operated until 2004. For 16 years prior to that, allegations of abuse and violence were ignored by welfare bosses in Wellington.\n\nIn a 2011 report, the Government's chief science adviser Sir Peter Gluckman concluded that evidence for \"boot camps and military style training\" programmes was \"limited or lacking\".\n\nThe Government has now acknowledged that there was abuse at Whakapakari. It faces claims from 80 former residents of the camp, some of whom have received financial settlements.", "time": "04:08:00"}

serious assault, sexual assaults, aggravated robbery and murder.\n\nThose who failed to complete their time at the military academy would have to serve out their sentence in an adult prison.\n\nYouth justice group JustSpeak said the Waiouru Army camp would become just another route to jail for those offenders.\n\nJustSpeak director Katie Bruce said it was a \"terrible idea\" and was \"not a route we want to go down\".\n\n\"It's been floated here for a few years, it's been tried and tested, both here and overseas... The evaluation found the young people commited more serious crimes on their release than those who had attended other institutions, or undertaken other programmes.\"\n\nSuccessive governments have funded various types of training-style programmes since the 1980s, including two initiatives set up by the current government.\n\nIn 2010 it launched a nine-week camp for the most serious, young recidivist male offenders in Christchurch.\n\nThat same year, Fresh Start camps - a court-supervised programme, providing up to ten days in adventure camp activities - was also started.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Paula Bennett said those programmes had worked.\n\n\"Actually they did lower offending for that hard group.\n\n\"But this is very different, when you are looking at a suspended sentence for up to a year.\"\n\nHowever, the Prime Minister's own chief science adviser Sir Peter Gluckman warned about the training in a 2011 report, saying there was no evidence it was working.\n\nKatie Bruce said the policy assumed the teenagers involved were lacking in discipline, \"but most have been failed by our society\".\n\nThe government said the militiary training academies would not be like a prison - but neither would they be a holiday.\n\nIf the young offender completed the year-long training, they could avoid their full court sentence, providing they did not reoffend within a year of being back in the community.\n\nNational also said it would introduce $200 spot fines police could issue to the parents of under-14 year-olds found walking the streets between midnight and 5am.\n\nJustice Minister Amy Adams said while police would have some discretion in issuing those fines, parents would be made to step up and take responsibility.", "time": "17:22:00"}

People have long been concerned about youth offenders going to prison. The SST do understand that and agree it was not the place for them, but that we needed a Military style camp for the offenders to be sentenced to attend. There they will learn there are consequences for their actions, they will learn to respect others; something lacking in many of the youth today.\"\n\nJustice Minister Amy Adams today also announced Police will have the power to issue infringement notices to parents of children under the age of 14 found walking the streets between 12am and 5am without supervision. Jess says she hopes this will help to break the cycle for when youth first start offending. \"Now if kids are caught tagging, or just wandering the streets looking for trouble, the parents will be held to account for not teaching their kids right from wrong.\"\n\nMost New Zealanders have long been wondering what has gone so wrong with all the youth offending that is happening at the moment - it starts at home. Parents not knowing where their kids are in the middle of the night; parents not teaching their kids that there will be consequences for their actions. With the new infringement notices that will be issued, parents will hopefully start concentrating more on showing their children the right path, and focus on teaching their kids respect and accountability - instilling the A, B, C, D's Accountability, Boundaries, Consequences and Discipline.\n\n$30 million over four years has been allocated to fund the YSO scheme with an estimated 50 youth offenders per year being sent to the training camp.\n\nJess said this is a win for the country. \"Yes $30 million is a lot of money, but the long-term benefits of having this bootcamp programme in place will we hope, see the decrease in the youth crime rate. The youth offenders that get sent to the bootcamp will all hopefully leave the Academy with a fresh outlook on life, with goals for a better future and remorse for their offending, rather than starting a career in serious offending.\"\n\n\"This programme will get them off the streets and out of the situations that are causing them to offend.\" Jess says.\n\nThe programme will support the youths to address problems like addiction, or lack of literacy and numeracy skills and teach them how they can better live their lives while keeping the public safe.\n\n\"Finally, we will be spending money that will be focused on the safety of the public. It will hopefully see the crime rate drop going forward and that in turn will mean less victims.\"\n\nJess says she is excited about this announcement \"This will now give the youth of New Zealand better opportunities to improve their future, it is a massive step in the right direction and an exciting opportunity for New Zealand.\"", "time": "07:05:00"}

She said this with a mother\u2019s tender words: \u201cA sign from Heaven.\u201d The Pope will canonize the youth, on a date to be made known on July 1, 2024, after approving a miracle attributed to his intercession. The Holy See announced that the person who was cured by Carlo Acutis\u2019 intercession is a young girl from Costa Rica: in 2022 she suffered a cyclist accident, which left her with a severe cranioencephalic trauma. The doctors gave her up for dead and she remained with assisted breathing. The young girl\u2019s mother visited Assisi and stayed kneeling before Carlo Acutis\u2019 tomb for a whole day. She left a letter and returned to her daughter, who began to breathe spontaneously. Carlo was proclaimed Blessed on October 10, 2020 in the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, after the miracle was confirmed of little Matheus, a Brazilian boy from Campo Grande do Sul, who suffered from annular pancreas, a congenital malformation which impeded his eating and made him vomit when he ate. His mother, Luciana Vianna, said: \u201cAt three and a half years old, he weighed 9 kilos. He was fed with a substance called milk, but which was pure protein and broken vitamins, as his body was unable to absorb them and only stayed minutes in his stomach.\u201d Luciana learnt that a relic of Carlo Acutis would be taken to her church; she witnessed the presentation of the relic during the Mass, and prayed for a miracle. \u201cThe priest said that anyone who needed a miracle should pray to Carlo because, to become a Saint, such a request was needed. It was the only thing that was lacking.\u201d Antonia Salzano, mother of the so-called \u201cCyber Apostle of the Eucharist,\u201d said recently she was certain that her son was a great intercessor before God. \u201cHe has a way of convincing the Lord so that Jesus cannot say no. And this gives me a little tenderness.\u201d She also said that she receives daily news of cures, of unexpected help, of small extraordinary things that many people receive through her son\u2019s intercession. She expressed an important focus of her son\u2019s life, who has \u201can important mission, especially among young people, to whom he left an exemplary witness of life in the simplicity of the daily (. . .). Carlo transmits an essential message: the importance of the Sacraments and of the sanctification of daily life.\u201d Moreover, he is \u201ca sign of hope, because he is a youth of today, who evolved in the world itself, peopled by the same dangers as all young people face, such as pornography, alcohol and drugs.\u201d In face of these traps, Carlo is a tranquilizing example, because he was able to remain unharmed without falling into to them.\u201d And she adds: \u201cNow the Lord has fulfilled the desire of the many who prayed for Carlo\u2019s canonization. We see it, obviously, as a sign from Heaven. It will surely enable him to carry out an even greater work than he is doing.\u201d Antonia said that her son loved God above all, and was able to make people change, even before his death in 2006. \u201cSo he also changed his mother, who wasn\u2019t in fact an example of holiness.\u201d Carlo Acutis had the mission to show many the importance of the Sacraments, effective signs of God to give the grace of sanctification, as his mother recalls. \u201cCarlo would say it to everyone, to young Internet users, to those far from the faith, to all.\u201d She also pointed out that his life was concentrated before its time. \u201cAt three months, he already said his first word. He started talking at five months, it was also thus with the faith: when we passed by a church he wanted to go in to greet Jesus. He would stay there and I would say to him that it was already late; he was only three years old.\u201d He made his First Communion when he was seven and then went to Mass every day, frequently to Eucharistic Adoration, to pray the Rosary. One could tell there was something within him and I believe people even approached him because of that.\u201d His behaviour since he was little manifested uncommon conduct. \u201cWhat I never thought was that Jesus would take him from me so soon. But God\u2019s plans are always greater. We accept Carlo\u2019s death, although it was premature, with faith and with the certainty that God does all that is best. And today, more than ever, we feel it so.\u201d * * * We offer, translated into English, the official ration of intercession to the forthcoming Saint approved by Bishop Domenico Sorrentino of Assisi: Oh God, our Father, thank you for having given us Carlo, a model of life for young people and a message of love for all. You made him fall in love with your Son Jesus, making of the Eucharist his \u201cpath to Heaven.\u201d You gave him Mary as his beloved Mother and with the Rosary You made her a singer of her tenderness. Accept his prayer for us. Look especially at the poor, those he loved and helped. Through his intercession, grant to me also the grace I need. And make our joy full by placing Carlo among the Blessed of your Holy Church, so that his smile shines before us again for the glory of your Name. Amen.", "summary": "<p>She adds: \u201cNow the Lord has fulfilled the desire of the many who prayed for Carlo\u2019s canonization.

Rights groups say over 300 people were killed but N'Djamena puts the toll of the October 2022 protests against the military rule at about 50.\n\nThe 40-year-old junta leader is seen as a favourite to easily win the polls after his main political rivals were either killed or barred from contesting.\n\nProminent opposition figure, Yaya Dillo Djerou Betchi, the president of the Socialist Party

disqualified at least ten candidates including Nassour Ibrahim Neguy Koursami, Rakhis Ahmat Saleh and Ahmat Hassaballah Soubiane, well-known vocal critics of the N'Djamena regime from competing.\n\nDeby's main challenger at Monday's vote, transitional prime minister, Succes Masra is largely seen as a stooge of the N'Djamena regime being used to legitimize the Deby dynasty.\n\nA former fierce critic of the N'Djamena regime, Masra was appointed Prime Minister of the transition government in January following his return from exile.\n\nThe International Crisis Group,(ICG), had said \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThe heavily criticised new constitution of the country, which gave Deby the son the leverage to run for Monday's election also allows the poll management body to publish only regional tallies instead of results at each polling station.\n\nThis, according to the ICG, \"will prevent observers from verifying results by adding up the numbers at polling stations\".\n\nDespite the fears, the junta leader and his main challenger have hailed the Chadian people for their massive participation in the election with both expressing confidence for a first-round victory.\n\nIn a message on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday, the junta leader paid a \"well-deserved tribute to the Chadian people who went to the polls en masse, and peacefully to elect their leader\".\n\nDeby said the serenity that characterized the process \"wonderfully crystallizes the democratic maturity of the sovereign people of Chad\".\n\nMasra on his part in a message the same day also hailed Chadians who he said came out massively, \"in a patriotic momentum\" to vote so and wished that \"the counting continues in calm and serenity\", the prime minister also wrote of on his official Facebook page.\n\nThough described as largely peaceful, the election was marred by the killing of a voter at a polling station in what authorities described as \"an isolated incident\".\n\nProvisional results are expected on May 21 and the outcome on June 5.\n\nA second round will be held on June 22, in case no candidate wins with more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round.", "source": {"uri": "nation.africa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The latter's party, The Transformers, on Wednesday (8 May) condemned violence and threats against 40-year-old economist, who was allegedly under \"surveillance\" and faced \"threats to his safety\". The party also reported threats against Masra's supporters, and alleged electoral fraud. Masra had, however, ramped up considerable support in recent weeks and could force a second round of voting, scheduled for 22 June.\n\nMeanwhile, some observers reportedly faced accreditation challenges, with no explanation given for the refusals, according to the Citizens' Alliance for Elections, a monitoring platform. Brussels on Tuesday (7 May) condemned the failure by Chad's junta-controlled authorities to allow nearly 3,000 civil society members financed by the EU to observe the presidential election. The opposition had called for a boycott, dismissing Monday's ballot as fixed, while international rights groups had warned that the vote was not expected to be free or fair after a crackdown on the opposition. Four civil society associations have slammed Deby-appointed electoral commission for refusing to accredit 2,900 of their representatives as voting observers. \"The EU in Chad condemns the non-accreditation of these civil society organizations,\" the EU said on Facebook.

Deby's main challenger, Prime Minister Succes Masra, is asking for international assistance, saying he is under surveillance and faces threats to his safety after at least two people were killed in the election.\n\nMasra says there has been persistent violence and threats against him and his supporters since election day.\n\nThe Transformers, the party Masra leads, said on Facebook Wednesday that their candidate's residence is under drone surveillance, but gave no further details.\n\nThe party denounced what it called threats and serious violence to intimidate their supporters, who they say have also been arbitrarily arrested since Monday's vote.\n\nMasra charged that Chad's National Elections Management Agency, known as ANGE, is rigging the vote in favor of Deby. Masra urged civilians to defend what he called their will expressed at the ballot box against massive electoral fraud.\n\nChad's Coalition of Moral Authorities for Mediation, or CONAMM, an association that includes traditional rulers, clerics, former government ministers and youth and women leaders, complained of massive fraud and intimidation during the polls.\n\nSpeaking on Chad's state television Thursday, CONAMM's secretary-general Baniara Yoyana said there were many irregularities including seizing and stuffing of ballot boxes in favor of Deby by government officials. He added such irregularities are pushing civilians who think that their democratic rights are being abused to riot.\n\nChad's opposition and civil society say a government soldier who attempted to stuff ballot boxes in favor of Deby died in a hospital after he was assaulted and stabbed by angry voters near Moundou, Chad's second-largest city.\n\nThey also say a civilian was killed on election day in Moundou following a dispute in a polling station.\n\nChad's government acknowledges the killings but denies troops were ordered to vote and rig the election in favor of Deby.\n\nThe central African state's officials say ANGE is a permanent, independent and impartial body and refute what they say are allegations Deby wants to rig the election and proclaim himself Chad's president.\n\nCivil society groups and CONAMM say Chad may descend into chaos if the government and ANGE fail to ensure the results they will publish reflect the aspirations of Chad's citizens as expressed in Monday's polls.\n\nSaleh Kebzabo's duty as Chad's government-appointed state mediator is to preempt and negotiate an end to potential crises and threats.\n\nHe said he is pleading with all citizens to be calm and maintain peace while waiting for the official proclamation of Chad's May 6 presidential elections results by the country's constitutional council, which is the only body empowered to proclaim definitive results. Kebzabo said results civilians appear to be contesting are fake because Chad's Constitutional Council has not proclaimed any.\n\nKebzabo said tensions are also provoked by a ban on filming or taking photos of result sheets in polling stations and publishing them on social media and radio and television. ANGE says it imposed the ban because opposition parties may manipulate results they film to ignite violent clashes.\n\nThe European Union said Tuesday that Chad officials denied nearly 3,000 civil society members it financed from observing the presidential election.\n\nDeby was proclaimed transitional president in April 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels following 30 years in power.\n\nHe promised an 18-month transition to democracy but then extended it by two years. He is seen by many observers as the likely winner of the May 6 presidential polls, whose result will be proclaimed by Chad's Constitutional Council on May 21.\n\nThe opposition and civil society accuse Deby ruling with an iron fist and say he is not ready to relinquish power. But Deby says he will hand over power if defeated.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idriss_D\u00e9by", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idriss D\u00e9by"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahamat_Idriss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahamat Idriss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transformers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_monitoring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election monitoring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moundou", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moundou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moundou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Council_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Council (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_transition_to_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish transition to democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/0325B495-E7DA-4897-9259-E19B21E6B878.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549623", "eventUri": "eng-9549623", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 246, "textEnd": 251, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 3975, "textEnd": 3981}], "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

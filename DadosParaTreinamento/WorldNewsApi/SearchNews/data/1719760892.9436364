[+] Barcelona. Getty Images Hansi Flick has spoken his first public words after being appointed the new head coach of FC Barcelona. Flick's appointment was announced on Wednesday afternoon in Catalonia, and he replaces fired club legend Xavi Hernandez in the dugout on a two-year contract set to expire on June 30, 2026. In a clip spanning more than two more minutes, and uploaded to the club's official X account, Flick first of all wanted to say thank you to everyone that was involved in making a \"big honor\" and a \"dream\" a reality for him. \"It's an honor and a dream to sign my contract here in Barcelona, to work for this amazing club, and I'm happy to start,\" Flick said. \"First of all this club is really unbelievable. In the hours I've been here in Barcelona it's been amazing, because everyone here at the club loves this club and tries to give their best for it to have success,\" Flick continued. The German believes that the Barca philosophy combines with his, in that they are both possession-based with a focus on attacking football. \"These are the things I love and we'll work on that,\" he vowed.

We have to care about what we focus on, and I'm really happy to do this with these guys.\" Flick was being humble when noting that he had \"won some titles with Bayern Munich\" which took in a 2019/2020 treble and overall sextuple like Pep Guardiola at Barca a decade before. He explained that his hunger for silverware remains \"really big\", and that he would like to \"stay on this path with Barcelona\" where he thinks \"we can achieve a lot together\". \"For the Culers,\" he said directly to the club's fans, \"I'd really like to start this journey together with you and for me it's really important that you support us. It's a big thing also for the team, and I think together we can achieve a lot with this amazing team.\" \"Visca Barca!,\" Flick signed off.

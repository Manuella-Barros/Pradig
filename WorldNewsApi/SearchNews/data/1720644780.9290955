You can buy JUP on Coinbase, Kraken and Binance. JUP has been one of the hottest token launches this year. Gaining just over 76% since its inception on Jan. 31, 2024, JUP is the governance token of the popular decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator Jupiter in the Solana ecosystem. With impressive fundamentals and a dominating market position, JUP has captured a lot of attention in the Web3 community. Jupiter Price Prediction Table To understand what experts think, Benzinga compiled the average price forecast of Jupiter (JUP) from Changelly from 2024-2050. What is Jupiter (JUP)? Jupiter (JUP) is one of the most popular decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators in the Solana ecosystem, launching in October 2021. As an aggregator, Jupiter mainly compiles different liquidity pools to give users the best price, enhancing token swaps and efficiency. Over time, Jupiter has expanded its functionality into perpetual futures, decentralized stablecoin management and its new LFG launchpad, helping Solana projects hit the ground running. Jupiter addresses a highly relevant problem in DeFi. With different DEXs, each with its own pools, there are often price discrepancies across cryptocurrencies. In some cases, this can lead to a loss of value on a transaction or swap since you may not be getting the best exchange rate for your assets. Aggregators like Jupiter pool resources across various liquidity pools on Solana, guaranteeing you the best asset price. JUP is the native token used to facilitate governance. On Jan. 31, 2024, Jupiter launched its token JUP. JUP is the native cryptocurrency used for governance in the Jupiter network. Users can vote on topics like liquidity plans, token issuance and other ecosystem-related projects by locking or staking their JUP and receiving yield in return. Will Jupiter Go Past All-Time Highs? Jupiter hit an all-time high (ATH) of $2.04 on Jan 31, 2024. JUP is down approximately 44% from this peak, trading at $1.13 in late May. As the market was heating up, with the recent Bitcoin halving and the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the crypto market received massive inflows. Among them, the Solana ecosystem exploded rapidly by creating many new wallets and projects. The need for the best swap rates was evident as more users interacted in the Solana ecosystem. As more users gravitate to Jupiter, more may opt to participate in governance, which rewards users with favorable APY returns. The rapid adoption of the Jupiter platform and attractive staking rewards caused JUP to raise its price significantly. As JUP continues to add new features to the platform, combined with its key position in the growing Solana ecosystem, it could have the potential to surpass ATHs. Jupiter Price History and Market Position Jupiter has risen to the dominant aggregator in the Solana ecosystem through its smooth user experience and robust features. JUP is currently the 63rd largest cryptocurrency by market cap, priced at $1.13, and a circulating supply of 1.35 billion JUP \u2014 $1.52 billion market cap. Launching this year, JUP is currently up over 76% year to date, growing by over 2.5% in the past month. Given the JUP token's recent release, there is less historical context to reference. However, Jupiter has established itself as the premier aggregator in the Solana ecosystem. Popular competitors include Raydium and Orca, which were launched in 2021 but have less volume and fewer users than Jupiter. Boasting a daily volume of $121.27 million, JUP is well-positioned as the leading DEX aggregator on Solana. With its widespread adoption in such a short period, JUP is building a credible reputation that could benefit its token\u2019s price. The JUP token is in its infancy, having only been launched for four months. It is challenging to know in which direction JUP\u2019s price will move; however, with solid fundamentals and a dominating stake in the Solana ecosystem, JUP has the potential and room to run. Coin Edition\u2019s Bullish Long-Term Price Prediction for Jupiter Coin Edition is a popular Web3 information site; it combines technical analysis with fundamental assessments to forecast token prices. Coin Edition speculates that JUP could reach as high as $13 in 2027, a 1,050% growth. This bullish opinion is based on technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD). Combined with Jupiter\u2019s strong pull in the Solana ecosystem, Coin Edition believes JUP can surpass expectations. While Coin Edition\u2019s outlook is favorable, investors should take each prediction with a grain of salt. CoinCodex\u2019s Bearish Long-Term Price Prediction for Jupiter CoinCodex, another Web3 outlet, shared a more moderate set of price predictions. Using multiple moving averages, CoinCodex sets targeted support and resistance lines to give a potential trading range for JUP. In 2027, CoinCodex posits that JUP can trade between $1.031472 on the low and $2.11 on the high end. The average price of $1.57 is significantly lower than the average cited in the table above. CoinCodex correlates its technical analysis with BTC halving cycles to give more context, stating that in 2027, the crypto market is likely to show bearish signs. Since CoinCodex relies heavily on technical analysis, the lack of JUP long-term market data should be considered. It is important to remember that all forecasts should not be taken as financial advice, and investors should only make decisions after thorough research. 2024 Jupiter (JUP) Price Prediction Many forecasts expect growth across the ecosystem, with the BTC halving now completed. AMBCrypto's average price estimate for JUP in 2024 is $2.33, which is a roughly 106% gain from current levels. Since the JUP token launched in January 2024, it has grown over 76%. Primarily used for governance, JUP\u2019s price appreciation should correlate to the number of token holders. As the platform gains users, they will be exposed to the yield that JUP can provide, potentially increasing token ownership. 2025 Jupiter (JUP) Price Prediction Changelly's average price forecast of JUP in 2025 is $1.92. While technical analysis is the primary factor in these predictions, macro conditions such as market conditions also play a role. Based on historical data, many experts posit that the BTC halving could ignite a bull cycle and ride into the end of 2025. As a major DEX aggregator on one of the most used chains, Solana, Jupiter could see increased usage in a bull scenario. With a prime positioning to capitalize on this uptrend, JUP is expected to grow from current levels. However, these predictions are speculative and should not be considered financial advice. 2030 Jupiter (JUP) Price Prediction According to Changelly, the average price experts believe JUP will be worth in 2030 is $12.91. This represents a 1,042% growth from current levels. This forecast is predicated on the expected demand for Jupiter\u2019s services and technical analysis. As more individuals use the platform, more individuals are likely to participate in governance, potentially increasing the token ownership of JUP. Individuals must recognize that predicting volatile assets like cryptocurrencies is difficult. The farther a forecast is made into the future, the more variance it will experience. The various known and unknown factors that contribute to price action affect JUP price in many unpredictable ways. It is important to take each prediction as only a possibility. Where to Buy Jupiter (JUP) The easiest way to purchase JUP is through Coinbase, Binance or Kraken. These platforms have simple interfaces, making trading JUP and other coins easy for traders of all levels. Each platform has multiple payment methods, from Apple Pay to ACH deposits. How Long Will It Take for Jupiter to Reach ATHs? It is nearly impossible to predict asset prices with certainty given the various variables that affect the value in the future. Many look into the past to make predictions, but JUP\u2019s token launched earlier this year, so there is little long-term data to draw from. While Jupiter is a leader in the market with strong fundamentals, it is hard to say when it will hit ATHs again. According to some experts, JUP is expected to reach ATHs between 2024 and 2025. However, this is merely a prediction and should not be taken as financial advice. Where to Store Jupiter (JUP) Safely Wallets are the most efficient way to store JUP and other digital assets securely. There are two types, each with its benefits and drawbacks. Hardware wallets are the most secure option, with assets stored offline. Investors tend to use these for long-term storage because of the lack of asset mobility. Software wallets are easier to transact, making them better choices for higher-frequency transactions. Best hardware wallet: Ledger offers excellent hardware wallets that keep crypto safe and secure offline. This wallet provides a simple and smooth user experience for all levels of investors. A popular choice among investors is the Ledger Nano X. Best software wallet: ZenGo allows you to bulletproof the security of your crypto without needing to take it offline. With an unparalleled user experience and secure recovery features, ZenGo is one of the best mobile wallets in the market right now. Current Crypto Prices The total crypto market cap is hovering around $2.55 trillion in late May 2024. The market has bounced significantly from the downtrends seen on past weeks, which may have signaled a bullish reversal. Since the recent halving, BTC is up over 6%, displaying confidence in the market. With passive inflows in BTC continuing through the spot ETFs released earlier this year, the crypto market continues to gain exposure. As adoption proliferates, many believe the crypto market is about to enter a bull cycle. While it is hard to say, overall market sentiment is positive. One bottleneck that continues to be an ongoing discussion in the crypto community is the regulatory uncertainty around cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. The novelty of crypto has made it hard for legislation to be proposed and implemented. Even so, conviction in crypto remains strong, and many are excited about what could be to come.

Nickels pleaded guilty to one count of transmitting threats in interstate commerce, which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.\n\n\"...you frauded out America of a real election, where Donald Trump blew your... a-- out of the water,\" Nickels said in one voicemail message, according to prosecutors. \"(Y)ou're gonna pay for it, you will pay for it; 10 million-plus patriots will surround you when you least expect it, and your little infantile Deep State security agency has no time to protect you because they'll be bought out and we'll f------ kill you.\"\n\nBarton and her family lived in fear and added security measures at their home after being threatened by Nickels. Prosecutors faulted Nickels for taking an \"irreversible toll\" on the former Rochester Hills clerk.\n\n\"He caused her to take protective measures to ensure her safety. And, with his coercive, intimidating, vengeful death threat, Nickels threatened the broader system of free and fair election administration in the State of Michigan,\" prosecutors Frances Carlson and Tanya Senanayake wrote in a sentencing memorandum.\n\n\"... the victims -- and all individuals who administer our elections -- deserve to be able to do their jobs without fear and intimidation, and to know that those who choose to threaten them will face just punishment,\" the prosecutors added.\n\nNickels' lawyer, Steve Scharg, did not respond to a message seeking comment. But after Nickels pleaded guilty in February, the defendant's attorney said: \"This case shows how mental health affects so many people. I wish we had more treatments available for helping people with mental health issues.\"\n\nSenanayake is a trial attorney with the counterterrorism section of the U.S. Justice Department's national security division in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors are arguing that Nickels qualifies for a terrorism enhancement that would add another year to the advisory sentencing guidelines in the case. The enhancement is justified, prosecutors argue, because the threats were designed \"to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\"\n\nThe number of open FBI investigations into domestic terrorism has more than quadrupled since 2013. Researchers have reviewed 501 cases involving threats to public officials, according to National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center researchers Pete Simi of Chapman University and Seamus Hughes of the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\n\nThis year is on pace to set a new record for the number of federal prosecutions involving threats to public officials, said Hughes, a senior faculty researcher.\n\nWhat 'terrorism enhancement' means\n\nTerrorism enhancements have been used sparingly in the past, occasionally against terrorism suspects who have been arrested on a non-terrorism-related charge, Hughes said.\n\n\"It's a tool by the Justice Department to put their finger on the scale and say that these types of crimes are particularly egregious with the hope that it deters others in the future,\" he said.\n\n\"The inclusion of a national security prosecutor from D.C. is an indication that the Justice Department is involved in these types of cases to a greater extent than they were previously and an increased dedication of personnel and resources on it,\" Hughes added.\n\nThe threats were targeted most frequently at members of the criminal justice system and military, politicians and election officials.\n\nIn the Michigan case, Nickels left a voicemail message for Barton after the election.\n\n\"We're watching your ... mouth talk about how you think that there's no irregularities...,\" Nickels said in a voicemail message on Nov. 10, 2020, according to the indictment.\n\nBarton previously wrote on X that Nickels' behavior \"has permanently impacted me and my family's lives.\"\n\n\"I will never be able to turn back the clock and go back to living in a sense of peace and security as I had done prior to this incident,\" wrote Barton, a Republican. \"I strongly believe that election officials should never be intimidated, threatened or harassed for doing their jobs serving the public.\"\n\nThe Nickels case also was a recent act of alleged antigovernment extremism in Michigan targeting politicians in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Grand juries and federal prosecutors in Michigan have filed charges against people in recent months and years for threatening President Joe Biden, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, other Democratic politicians, law enforcement officers, as well as members of the LGBTQ+ and Jewish communities.\n\nAlso, at least 28 people from Michigan -- and more than 1,300 nationwide -- have been charged with crimes related to the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn her letter to the court, Benson called the former Rochester Hills clerk \"an American hero\" for ensuring the vote tally was accurate and reflected the will of the city's voters.\n\n\"Just because clerks have been incredibly resilient to these attacks cannot mean that we have reached a new normal,\" wrote Benson, a Democrat. \"These threats pose real danger to dedicated public servants and present a crisis for not only American democracy, but our most fundamental values. There must be swift and appropriate consequences for threatening our election professionals.\"\n\nBarton's experience is not isolated.\n\nAlmost 40% of local election officials reported being threatened, harassed or abused in recent years, according to a 2024 survey conducted by the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.\n\nIn a letter to the court, the co-chairs of the National Council on Election Integrity and Carah Ong Whaley, director of election protection at Issue One, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization focused on campaign finance reform, called for stringent legal actions and providing a \"robust response to such threats.\"\n\n\"This case is a stark reminder of the severity and immediacy of the threats against those who uphold our electoral system,\" they wrote.\n\nThe day Nickels allegedly issued the threat, Nov. 10, 2020, was one week after the presidential election. On that date, a Washington Post story referenced a video Barton posted on Twitter.\n\nIn the video, Barton responded to claims by Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel that 2,000 Republican ballots in Rochester Hills had been \"given to Democrats ... due to a clerical error.\"\n\nBarton responded by saying \"that McDaniel was referring to an 'isolated mistake that was quickly rectified' and called her allegation 'categorically false,'\" according to the story.\n\nIn his voicemail, Nickels also said: \"(You) will f------ pay for your f------ lying ass remarks. Watch your f------ back.\"\n\nBarton oversaw elections in the Oakland County community from 2013 to March 2021. She later worked as a senior adviser for U.S. Election Assistance Commission and serves as a senior election expert with The Elections Group.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Death threats like the ones Tina faced are never acceptable, and they endanger not only the public servants who administer our elections, but also democracy itself,\" Penzone said in the

(Clarence Tabb Jr./Detroit News/TNS)\n\nAn Indiana man should spend more time in federal prison for threatening to kill the Rochester Hills, Michigan, clerk after the 2020 election, prosecutors argued, saying he \"terrorized\" the election official amid an increase of threats aimed at politicians.\n\nAndrew Nickels, 38, of Carmel, Indiana, is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Laurie Michelson on Tuesday, and federal prosecutors in Detroit are seeking at least a two-year prison sentence and have enlisted Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to convey the impact threats have on election workers.\n\nNickels is being sentenced to five months after pleading guilty to threatening to kill former Rochester Hills Clerk Tina Barton after she defended the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, in which Trump lost Michigan to Democrat Joe Biden.

But after Nickels pleaded guilty in February, the defendant's attorney said: \"This case shows how mental health affects so many people. I wish we had more treatments available for helping people with mental health issues.\"\n\nSenanayake is a trial attorney with the counterterrorism section of the U.S. Justice Department's national security division in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors are arguing that Nickels qualifies for a terrorism enhancement that would add another year to the advisory sentencing guidelines in the case. The enhancement is justified, prosecutors argue, because the threats were designed \"to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\"\n\nThe number of open FBI investigations into domestic terrorism has more than quadrupled since 2013. Researchers have reviewed 501 cases involving threats to public officials, according to National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center researchers Pete Simi of Chapman University and Seamus Hughes of the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\n\nThis year is on pace to set a new record for the number of federal prosecutions involving threats to public officials, said Hughes, a senior faculty researcher.\n\nTerrorism enhancements have been used sparingly in the past, occasionally against terrorism suspects who have been arrested on a non-terrorism-related charge, Hughes said.\n\n\"It's a tool by the Justice Department to put their finger on the scale and say that these types of crimes are particularly egregious, with the hope that it deters others in the future,\" he said.\n\n\"The inclusion of a national security prosecutor from D.C. is an indication that the Justice Department is involved in these types of cases to a greater extent than they were previously and an increased dedication of personnel and resources on it,\" Hughes added.\n\nThe threats were targeted most frequently at members of the criminal justice system and military, politicians and election officials.\n\nIn the Michigan case, Nickels left a voicemail message for Barton after the election.\n\n\"We're watching your ... mouth talk about how you think that there's no irregularities,\" Nickels said in a voicemail message on Nov. 10, 2020, according to the indictment.\n\nBarton previously wrote on X that Nickels' behavior \"has permanently impacted me and my family's lives.\"\n\n\"I will never be able to turn back the clock and go back to living in a sense of peace and security as I had done prior to this incident,\" wrote Barton, a Republican. \"I strongly believe that election officials should never be intimidated, threatened or harassed for doing their jobs serving the public.\"\n\nThe Nickels case also was a recent act of alleged antigovernment extremism in Michigan targeting politicians in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Grand juries and federal prosecutors in Michigan have filed charges against people in recent months and years for threatening President Joe Biden, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, other Democratic politicians, and law enforcement officers as well as members of the LGBTQ+ and Jewish communities.\n\nAlso, at least 28 people from Michigan -- and more than 1,300 nationwide -- have been charged with crimes related to the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn her letter to the court, Benson called the former Rochester Hills clerk \"an American hero\" for ensuring the vote tally was accurate and reflected the will of the city's voters.\n\n\"Just because clerks have been incredibly resilient to these attacks cannot mean that we have reached a new normal,\" wrote Benson, a Democrat. \"These threats pose real danger to dedicated public servants and present a crisis for not only American democracy, but our most fundamental values. There must be swift and appropriate consequences for threatening our election professionals.\"\n\nBarton's experience is not isolated.\n\nAlmost 40% of local election officials reported being threatened, harassed or abused in recent years, according to a 2024 survey conducted by the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.\n\nIn a letter to the court, the co-chairs of the National Council on Election Integrity and Carah Ong Whaley, director of election protection at Issue One, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization focused on campaign finance reform, called for stringent legal actions and providing a \"robust response to such threats.\"\n\n\"This case is a stark reminder of the severity and immediacy of the threats against those who uphold our electoral system,\" they wrote.\n\nThe day Nickels allegedly issued the threat, Nov. 10, 2020, was one week after the presidential election. On that date, a Washington Post story referenced a video Barton posted on Twitter.\n\nIn the video, Barton responded to claims by Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel that 2,000 Republican ballots in Rochester Hills had been \"given to Democrats ... due to a clerical error.\"\n\nBarton responded by saying \"that McDaniel was referring to an 'isolated mistake that was quickly rectified' and called her allegation 'categorically false,'\" according to the story.\n\nIn his voicemail, Nickels also said: \"(You) will f -- -- pay for your f -- -- lying ass remarks. Watch your f -- -- back.\"\n\nBarton oversaw elections in the Oakland County community from 2013 to March 2021. She later worked as a senior adviser for U.S. Election Assistance Commission and serves as a senior election expert with The Elections Group.", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com",

He had pleaded guilty in February to transmitting threats in interstate commerce.\n\nIn a voicemail left on Nov. 10, 2020, Nickels threatened to kill Tina Barton, a Republican who at the time was the clerk in Rochester Hills, Michigan. Investigators said he accused her of fraud and said she deserved a \"throat to the knife\" for saying there were no irregularities in the 2020 election.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump had claimed there were election irregularities in Michigan and elsewhere following his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Michigan Republican lawmakers investigated the 2020 presidential election for months and found no widespread or systemic fraud, concluding that Biden had won the state.\n\nBarton said in a victim impact statement, \"No one should have to live in fear for their life or endure the trauma that has been inflicted upon me -- especially those dedicated to ensuring our elections are administered fairly and accurately.\"\n\nShe is now vice chair of the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections, a national group. That group's chair, former Maricopa County (Arizona) Sheriff Paul Penzone, said Tuesday in a statement that Nickels' sentence sends a \"signal to election officials across the country that threats against them will be taken seriously and those who engage in such behavior will be held accountable.\"\n\nProsecutors had sought a sentence of at least 24 months for Nickels, explaining a terrorism enhancement was warranted to exceed the sentencing range of 10 to 16 months calculated by the probation department.\n\nDefense attorney Steven Scharg said a prison sentence was not warranted for his client. He said Nickels had no prior criminal history and at the time of the offense he was not taking his medications for mental health conditions diagnosed in 2008.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He had pleaded guilty in February to transmitting threats in interstate commerce.\n\nIn a voicemail left on Nov. 10, 2020, Nickels threatened to kill Tina Barton, a Republican who at the time was the clerk in Rochester Hills, Michigan.

He said Nickels had no prior criminal history and at the time of the offense he was not taking his medications for mental health conditions diagnosed in 2008.\n\nFor copyright information, check with

Trump lost the state to Joe Biden by more than 154,000 votes.\n\n\"[Y]ou frauded out America of a real election,\" Nickels was reported to have said, who then told Barton, \"You're gonna pay for it,\" and described how \"10 million plus patriots will surround you when you least expect it ...

Watch your [expletive] back.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney Dawn Ison for the Eastern District of Michigan said the threats made against Barton \"undermine our democracy by making elections workers fearful for their lives and for the safety of their families -- just for doing their jobs,\" adding that the sentence should send a clear message that those who seek to \"jeopardize the fair and free administration of our elections with threats of violence will be vigorously prosecuted and held accountable.\"\n\nBarton posted to social media following the sentencing, saying while more than 1,300 days had passed since Nickels threatened her life and the lives of her family, his words were \"forever seared\" into her memory.\n\n\"The cold, calculated tone of his voice, and the vile, despicable, and sexualized language he used to degrade and debase me are something that I hear in my head almost daily. His threat to end my life when I least expected it, robbed me of my sense of security, my peace of mind,\" said Barton. \"There is a resilience within me that refuses to be extinguished. I refuse to let the words of this man define me, to let his twisted fantasies of violence and domination dictate the course of my life.\"\n\nBarton now serves as a vice chair of the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections (CSSE), a national organization of \"cross-partisan experts in election administration and law enforcement who aim to support policies and practices that protect election workers and voters from violence, threats and intimidation.\"\n\nCSSE Chair Paul Penzone, a former Maricopa County, Ariz. sheriff, issued a statement Tuesday calling the sentencing of Nickels a signal that threats against election officials would be taken seriously and those perpetrating them would be held accountable.\n\n\"Death threats like the ones Tina faced are never acceptable, and they endanger not only the public servants who administer our elections, but also democracy itself. Accountability and the rule of law matter, and we hope this sentencing helps deter others from threatening, harassing, or intimidating election officials,\" said Penzone. \"Tina has shown immense courage and grace throughout the legal process, drawing from her own experience to help shield other election officials from what she has experienced. In her role with CSSE, she builds relationships between election officials and law enforcement, develops resources, and facilitates dozens of tabletop exercises (TTXs) around the country. I am honored to work alongside her.\"\n\nThe Detroit News quoted Nickels defense attorney Steve Scharg as saying his client suffered from mental illness.\n\n\"I wish we had more treatments available for helping people with mental health issues,\" Scharg said in February when Nickels entered his plea.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland also issued a statement, saying the Justice Department \"has no tolerance for violent threats against election workers, officials, and volunteers, and as this case demonstrates, we will aggressively investigate and prosecute such threats to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nBarton noted that threats against election officials were an \"assault on the democratic principles that form the backbone of our society\" and the message for those like Nickels was \"a strong one - if you threaten the life of an election official, you will be held accountable and the price will be high.\"\n\n\"My faith in God gives me strength every day.

Trump lost the state to Joe Biden by more than 154,000 votes.\n\n\"[Y]ou frauded out America of a real election,\" Nickels was reported to have said, who then told Barton, \"You're gonna pay for it,\" and described how \"10 million plus patriots will surround you when you least expect it ... [and] ... kill you.\" Nickels then threatened Barton's family and concluded by saying, \"You deserve a [expletive] throat to the knife. ... Watch your [expletive] back. ... Watch your [expletive] back.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney Dawn Ison for the Eastern District of Michigan said the threats made against Barton \"undermine our democracy by making elections workers fearful for their lives and for the safety of their families -- just for doing their jobs,\" adding that the sentence should send a clear message that those who seek to \"jeopardize the fair and free administration of our elections with threats of violence will be vigorously prosecuted and held accountable.\"\n\nBarton posted to social media following the sentencing, saying while more than 1,300 days had passed since Nickels threatened her life and the lives of her family, his words were \"forever seared\" into her memory.\n\n\"The cold, calculated tone of his voice, and the vile, despicable, and sexualized language he used to degrade and debase me are something that I hear in my head almost daily. His threat to end my life when I least expected it, robbed me of my sense of security, my peace of mind,\" said Barton. \"There is a resilience within me that refuses to be extinguished. I refuse to let the words of this man define me, to let his twisted fantasies of violence and domination dictate the course of my life.\"\n\nBarton now serves as a vice chair of the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections (CSSE), a national organization of \"cross-partisan experts in election administration and law enforcement who aim to support policies and practices that protect election workers and voters from violence, threats and intimidation.\"\n\nCSSE Chair Paul Penzone, a former Maricopa County, Ariz. sheriff, issued a statement Tuesday calling the sentencing of Nickels a signal that threats against election officials would be taken seriously and those perpetrating them would be held accountable.\n\n\"Death threats like the ones Tina faced are never acceptable, and they endanger not only the public servants who administer our elections, but also democracy itself. Accountability and the rule of law matter, and we hope this sentencing helps deter others from threatening, harassing, or intimidating election officials,\" said Penzone. \"Tina has shown immense courage and grace throughout the legal process, drawing from her own experience to help shield other election officials from what she has experienced. In her role with CSSE, she builds relationships between election officials and law enforcement, develops resources, and facilitates dozens of tabletop exercises (TTXs) around the country. I am honored to work alongside her.\"\n\nThe Detroit News quoted Nickels defense attorney Steve Scharg as saying his client suffered from mental illness.\n\nAs political threats intensify, Michigan Dems look to ban guns at polling places\n\n\"I wish we had more treatments available for helping people with mental health issues,\" Scharg said in February when Nickels entered his plea.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland also issued a statement, saying the Justice Department \"has no tolerance for violent threats against election workers, officials, and volunteers, and as this case demonstrates, we will aggressively investigate and prosecute such threats to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nBarton noted that threats against election officials were an \"assault on the democratic principles that form the backbone of our society\" and the message for those like Nickels was \"a strong one - if you threaten the life of an election official, you will be held accountable and the price will be high.\"\n\n\"My faith in God gives me strength every day.

That group's chair, former Maricopa County (Arizona) Sheriff Paul Penzone, said Tuesday in a statement that Nickels' sentence sends a \"signal to election officials across the country that threats against them will be taken seriously and those who engage in such behavior will be held accountable.\"\n\nProsecutors had sought a sentence of at least 24 months for Nickels, explaining a terrorism enhancement was warranted to exceed the sentencing range of 10 to 16 months calculated by the probation department.\n\nDefense attorney Steven Scharg said a prison sentence was not warranted for his client.

Announced by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and launched by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco in June 2021, the task force has led the department's efforts to address threats of violence against election workers, and to ensure that all election workers -- whether elected, appointed, or volunteer -- are able to do their jobs free from threats and intimidation. The task force engages with the election community and state and local law enforcement to assess allegations and reports of threats against election workers, and has investigated and prosecuted these matters where appropriate, in partnership with FBI Field Offices and U.S. Attorneys' Offices throughout the country. The task force is continuing this work and supporting the U.S. Attorneys' Offices and FBI Field Offices nationwide as they carry on the critical work that the task force has begun.\n\nThe task force is led by the Criminal Division's Public Integrity Section and includes several other entities within the Justice Department, including the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Civil Rights Division, National Security Division, and FBI, as well as key interagency partners, such as the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. For more information regarding the Justice Department's efforts to combat threats against election workers, read the Deputy Attorney General's memo.\n\nTo report suspected threats or violent acts, contact your local FBI office and request to speak with the Election Crimes Coordinator. Contact information for every FBI field office may be found at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/. You may also contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324) or file an online complaint at www.tips.fbi.gov. Complaints submitted will be reviewed by the task force and referred for investigation or response accordingly. If someone is in imminent danger or risk of harm, contact 911 or your local police immediately.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice_Criminal_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice Criminal Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Task force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_N._Ison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dawn N.

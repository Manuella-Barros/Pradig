In order to claim Waege, the Packers also released defensive tackle Rodney Mathews. The Packers announced Mathews' release via their team website, but made no mention of the waiver claim for Waege.\n\nWaege was on waivers after being released by the San Francisco 49ers. Now, Waege will quickly get another opportunity to prove himself at Packers training camp. If he can do enough, he may be able to sneak onto the 53-man roster or practice squad.\n\nAfter growing up on a farm in South Dakota, it seems fitting that Waege is heading to Green Bay.\n\nA virtually unknown player in high school, Waege only had a few college offers in 2017. One of those schools was FCS powerhouse North Dakota State, however, giving him an opportunity to play on a national stage.\n\nWaege had an almost immediate impact for the Bison. After making the FCS Freshman All-American team in 2019, he earned two more All-American honors before going pro. He was a finalist for the FCS Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2022 after racking up 17.5 tackles for loss and nine sacks on the year.\n\nAfter dominating at the FCS level, Waege got an opportunity with the 49ers as an undrafted free agent last season. While he didn't make the final roster, he was eventually able to land on the team's practice squad.\n\nAt the very least, Waege brings a good athletic profile to Green Bay. He is listed a tick under 6'5'' and 295 pounds while boasting a Relative Athletic Score of 9.58 out of 10. That score is boosted thanks to a 40-yard dash time of 4.91 seconds and a three-cone time of 7.19 seconds.\n\nIt's not a surprise that Packers GM Brian Gutekunst showed interest in Waege with that kind of athletic profile.\n\nWaege will be an interesting story heading into training camp. However, the Packers already have quite a bit of depth on the defensive line.\n\nKenny Clark remains one of Green Bay's biggest stars. At 28 years old, he's already a three-time Pro Bowler with 34 career sacks. He'll likely start alongside former first-round pick Devonte Wyatt, who finally started to flash as a pass rusher in 2023.\n\nBehind those two are a handful of intriguing options. T.J. Slaton has been a run-stuffing nose tackle, but may not fit as well in Jeff Hafley's new defensive scheme.\n\nKarl Brooks is a much more interesting name to keep an eye on. The 2023 rookie was an edge rusher at Bowling Green, but flashed on the inside last season. He finished the year with four sacks and a forced fumble in limited playing time.\n\nBehind those four, there may be an open competition to keep another defensive tackle on the 53-man roster. Former seventh-round pick Jonathan Ford could steal that spot, but hasn't done much in two seasons with the Packers.\n\nIf Green Bay wants to keep a fifth defensive tackle, then Waege may have a very real chance at shining in training camp.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_brooke@heavy.com", "name": "Tyler Brooke", "type": "author",

With a roster at capacity, the Packers complied with their 91-man off-season roster limit by letting go of defensive tackle Rodney Mathews.\n\nDespite being named an FCS All-American several times during his college career, Waege went undrafted in 2023, leading to the 49ers signing him as an undrafted free agent. According to Pro Football Focus, Waege played 55 defensive snaps for San Francisco during his rookie preseason -- mostly as a three-technique defensive tackle -- but was unable to make the active roster at cutdowns.\n\nAfter being released last August, Waege worked out for the Pittsburgh Steelers and later re-signed with the 49ers' practice squad. At the end of San Francisco's postseason run, Waege signed a reserve/futures deal with the team. He stayed on the offseason roster up until Wednesday, when he was waived by the 49ers.\n\nOn paper, Waege, a former defensive end, is very athletic for a defensive tackle. Notable numbers from his pro day at North Dakota State include a 7.19-second three-cone, which would be solid for an edge defender, and a 4.91-second 40-yard dash at nearly 6'5\" and 295 pounds. Based on a few highlights, that speed and bend seem to translate to the field.\n\nMathews, meanwhile, was one of seven undrafted free-agent rookies that the Packers signed immediately after the 2024 draft. Just a week ago, Green Bay hosted its rookie minicamp, where three other players were added to the roster. For whatever reason, Mathews' rookie minicamp performance was edged out by Waege and fellow 2024 rookie free-agent defensive tackle James Ester.\n\nAt the moment, the Packers carry eight defensive tackles on their roster: Kenny Clark, Devonte Wyatt, T.J. Slaton, Karl Brooks, Colby Wooden, Jonathan Ford, Ester and now Waege.", "source": {"uri": "acmepackingcompany.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Acme Packing Company"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justis_mosqueda@acmepackingcompany.com", "name": "Justis Mosqueda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Wilson_(lacrosse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Wilson (lacrosse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ford_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Ford (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Brooks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Wooden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colby Wooden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonte_Wyatt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devonte Wyatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Clark_(defensive_tackle)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Clark (defensive tackle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_Bison_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State Bison football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hln6QU3fyfBpIrShbrSb1ylHfqw=/0x584:8131x4650/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25441065/1973668512.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554917", "eventUri": "eng-9554917", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

To clear a space on their 90-man roster, they released undrafted rookie Rodney Mathews.\n\nWaege was a superb player at FCS powerhouse North Dakota State. He was a Freshman All-American in 2019, a second-team All-American during the 2020-21 COVID season and a first-team All-American and finalist for the Buck Buchanan FCS Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2022.\n\nAfter missing most of the 2021 season with a knee injury, he had nine sacks and 17.5 tackles for losses in 2022. In 57 career games that included 29 starts, he finished sixth in NDSU history with 42 tackles for losses.\n\nHe grew up on a farm in South Shore, S.D.\n\n\"Some of them [his 49ers teammates] can't actually believe the stuff we have to do,\" he told Keloland earlier this year. \"We talk about the process of pulling a calf and you start telling them what you got to do with your arm and right after that they are like 'Hold on. You have to do what?'\"\n\nWaege joined the 49ers as an undrafted free agent last year. He failed to make their roster, then spent the second half of the season on their practice squad.\n\nThat included being on the sideline for the playoff victory over the Packers as well as the Super Bowl.\n\n\"I think having a year of experience under my belt, I think that'll do a lot,\" he said. \"It helps confidence, it helps knowing the routine, knowing the system, knowing the playbook, so that'll be the biggest thing that will play into it.\"\n\nHe added: \"It was honestly something you always dreamed about, being at one of those games as a kid watching it on TV and how big of a game it was,\" he said. \"To now have been on the sidelines and been a part of a Super Bowl team, I mean, that's just something I never thought I'd be able to do.\"\n\nWell, he did think about it, actually. His original NFL dream was to make it as a kicker.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many times and how many hours I spent out there kicking footballs through that goalpost,\" Waege told InForum. \"I hit my growth spurt, got a little bigger and realized I'm probably not going to be a kicker anymore.\"\n\nMathews was one of eight undrafted free agents signed by the Packers. After a year of junior college, Mathews was a three-year starter at Ohio University. He set career highs with 26 tackles and seven tackles for losses in 2022, and followed it up with 20 tackles, 4.5 TFLs and one interception as a captain in 2023.\n\nMathews had a quiet rookie camp, though, which probably is why the Packers made the change.\n\nMathews' Relative Athletic Score was 2.81. At 6-foot-4 3/4 and 285 pounds before the 2023 draft, Waege ran a 4.91 40 and assembled a RAS of 9.58.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Buchanan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buck Buchanan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_Bison_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State Bison football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Junior college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4589,h_2581,x_0,y_57/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/packer_central/01hxfk294wwn7tymd3hv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554917", "eventUri": "eng-9554917", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

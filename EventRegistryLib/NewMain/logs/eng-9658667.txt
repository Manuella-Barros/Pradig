Prosecutors allege she was driving drunk following a night out and intentionally struck O'Keefe while dropping him off at an afterparty in Canton.\n\nLawyers for the Mansfield woman have another theory. They've suggested O'Keefe walked into the party at 34 Fairview Road and was severely beaten, with Read later framed in a conspiracy intended to protect relatives of the homeowner, a fellow Boston police officer.\n\nRead's trial left off Friday with testimony from State Police Trooper Joseph Paul, who works with the agency's Collision Analysis and Reconstruction Section. Pointing to data that he said could have been logged on Read's SUV around the time she allegedly struck O'Keefe, Paul told jurors Read appeared to accelerate in reverse before her speed suddenly dropped and her steering wheel jostled slightly.\n\n\"There's a point in there where it appears to be consistent with a pedestrian strike,\" Paul said. He also asserted that O'Keefe's blunt force injuries and abrasions were consistent with a pedestrian collision.\n\nPaul further testified that Read's car had a broken taillight, scratches, a dent, and pieces of glass on the bumper when he inspected the vehicle at the Canton Police Department on Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nJudge Beverly Cannone has yet to say whether Paul will be allowed to testify about Ring surveillance camera footage from O'Keefe's driveway. Read's lawyers have suggested the video -- which shows Read's SUV backing out of the garage and reversing toward O'Keefe's parked car shortly after 5 a.m. on the 29th -- could offer another explanation for the damaged taillight.\n\nMeanwhile, jurors on Friday also heard from digital forensics expert Jessica Hyde, who unpacked the cellphone data behind witness Jennifer McCabe's contested Google search for \"hos long to die in cold.\" Hyde testified that the search was not made at 2:27 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2022, as the defense has suggested. Rather, she said, that early morning timestamp could indicate when the browser tab was first opened.\n\nDefense attorney David Yannetti asked whether Hyde's analysis ruled out a search at or before 2:27 a.m.\n\n\"There is a very unlikely possibility based on the fact that there is no evidence that the search occurred before that time,\" she replied, adding, \"I can't rule out something that doesn't exist.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abby_patkin@boston.com", "name": "Abby Patkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lexus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reconstruction era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blunt trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooper_(police_rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trooper (police rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_forensics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital forensics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Divination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Divination", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Officer_Killed_Girlfriend_Trial_76547-666c7f505ca44-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658667", "eventUri": "eng-9658667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Software expert Ian Whiffin testified after Paul, answering questions about a much discussed Google search by one of the people involved in this case.\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is facing charges including second degree murder after prosecutors said she hit Boston police officer John O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die after dropping him off outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert.\n\nRead and O'Keefe were dating when O'Keefe died.\n\nRead's defense has said she is being framed, saying O'Keefe was actually beaten to death and attacked by a dog during a party inside the Albert home.\n\nRead's attorneys claim police covered up details and planted evidence to implicate Read in the case. Among allegations, the defense has focused on state police Trooper Michael Proctor as an investigator they say was involved in the alleged cover-up.\n\nRead has pleaded not guilty in the case and maintains her innocence.\n\nTrooper continues testimony\n\nJoseph Paul, who works with the state police collision analysis and reconstruction unit, said the data he reviewed was consistent with a pedestrian strike, saying this incident could have been a \"side swipe\" strike in which Read hit O'Keefe with the corner of her car.\n\nIn cross examination on Monday, defense attorney Alan Jackson grilled Paul about his knowledge of physics.\n\n\"The truth is, you have no idea what all these physics calculations are, correct?\" Jackson asked.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Adam Lally objected to Jackson's line of questioning and warned Jackson to not continue making statements and remarks through his questions.\n\nPaul said Read's Lexus hit O'Keefe's arm but not his torso. He said the impact broke Read's tail light, leaving scratches on O'Keefe's forearm from pieces of broken plastic. As O'Keefe spun counter clockwise after the collision, Paul said, it is possible he hit is head on the curb.\n\n\"How do you account for the fact he didn't have a broken bone,\" Jackson asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Paul answered.\n\nJackson soon finished his cross examination after accusing Paul of making conclusions that don't make sense because Trooper Michael Proctor told him to. He asked, at one point, if Paul was \"trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\"\n\nSoftware expert testifies\n\nAfter Paul, Ian Whiffin took the stand as the prosecution's 65th witness against Read.\n\nWhiffin is a decoding product manager and former senior digital intelligence expert at Cellebrite, which makes forensic software.\n\nWhiffin examined a search sent by Jennifer McCabe, who has been a focus of questioning from Read's defense team.\n\nMcCabe was at the party at the Albert house the night O'Keefe died and at one point searched \"Hos long to die in cold?\" on the morning of Jan. 29.\n\nThe defense has argued McCabe made the search at 2:27 a.m., hours before O'Keefe's body was found. McCabe and several witnesses have said she made the search later in the day at the urging of Read after Read spotted O'Keefe in the snow.\n\nWhiffin said the search happened at 6:23 a.m., saying \"There's plenty of other evidence\" to show him what was going on.\n\nAt the time the the defense claims the search happened, Whiffin said, McCabe was actually looking up youth sports schedules. Prosecutors said McCabe was home at the time, hours before she learned O'Keefe was missing.\n\nDigital forensic expert Jessica Hyde previously told jurors McCabe's search could have been timestamped at 2:27 a.m., rather than 6:23 a.m., because that was the time when she first opened the tab where she made the search.\n\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

So yeah I'm not as quick to jump back into being lovie dovie as you apparently.\"\n\nAfter Read called him over a dozen times, he wrote, \"Omg!! Stop calling.\"\n\nState Trooper Nicholas Guarino, assigned to the detective unit of the Norfolk district attorney's office, said he performed cellphone extractions for O'Keefe and Read's devices after O'Keefe's fatally injured body was found in the snow early on Jan. 29, 2022.\n\nGuarino read O'Keefe and Read's messages to the jurors in the Dedham courtroom in Norfolk Superior Court, providing an unedited glimpse of the dynamics within the couple's argument-prone relationship.\n\nRead texted that she felt set up to \"fail,\" while O'Keefe said he was tired of being the \"bad guy.\"\n\nProsecutors have alleged that the couple's relationship was strained and that Read, 44, was drunk and had argued with O'Keefe, who lived in Canton, when she dropped him off at an after-party on Fairview Road. They allege that she intentionally rammed her Lexus SUV into O'Keefe while making a three-point turn and left him for dead as a blizzard set in.\n\nRead, of Mansfield, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter, second-degree murder, and other charges.\n\nAttorneys for Read insist she's being framed and that O'Keefe entered the Fairview Road home, owned at the time by a fellow Boston officer who had been out drinking with the couple and others. They assert that O'Keefe was fatally beaten inside the home before his body was planted on the lawn in freezing temperatures.\n\nThe couple's text threads showed that they had argued early Jan. 28, 2022.\n\nRead said, \"you gave me utter grief this morning,\" and asked O'Keefe, \"why would you start with me this morning.\"\n\nShe texted that she had been \"trying to get over the hump [with] arguing and now you tell me you're not into things. And you don't want to fight weekly but fly off the handle at 8 am w me. Like you're setting me up to fail.\"\n\nO'Keefe apologized. \"I'm sorry. This has been an issue w me for 8 years,\" he texted \"It physically [hurts] me to see EVERYONE else in their life do things for them and I'm forced to ALWAYS be the bad guy!\"\n\nAfter Read texted that she didn't understand why O'Keefe \"lashed out at\" her when she was \"just trying my hardest,\" he responded, \"Not sure what you want me to do. I said I'm sorry and I was outta line. If you prefer to stay home I totally get it.\"\n\n\"Tell me if you are interested in someone else,\" Read wrote later. \"Can't think of any other reason you've been like this.\"\n\n\"Sick of always arguing and fighting,\" O'Keefe wrote.\n\nEarlier in the day, a crash reconstruction specialist, State Police Trooper Joseph Paul, testified that the data collection system on Read's SUV showed the vehicle collided with something about around 12:45 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2022. The SUV was in reverse as it traveled more than 24 miles per hour for approximately 60 feet, he said.\n\n\"It occurred in the area of 34 Fairview Road,\" Paul said. \"The operator appeared to be Karen Read, and the pedestrian was John O'Keefe.\"\n\nAnother specialist, Ian Whiffin, a product manager at Cellebrite, a digital forensics firm, testified about the disputed timestamp on Google search conducted by Jennifer McCabe, who was with Read when she discovered O'Keefe's body.\n\nMcCabe, whose sister lived at Fairview Road, previously told jurors she searched, \"hos long to die in the cold,\" which contains a typo in the first word, at Read's insistence shortly after 6:30 a.m.\n\nRead's defense team says cellphone records show the search was made shortly before 2:30 a.m.\n\nWhiffin said the 2:27 a.m. timestamp was \"not the time, in my opinion, that the search was conducted.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_County_Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk County Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

Judge Beverly Cannone is expected to decide, potentially on Thursday, if the defense will be able to call the witnesses. There was no court on Wednesday due to the Juneteenth holiday.\n\nThe prosecution is down to its final witnesses in the trial and could rest its case before the week is up.\n\nRead is accused of hitting O'Keefe, with her SUV on January 29, 2022, and leaving him to die in the snow. Defense attorneys argue Read is being framed by several people, including law enforcement.\n\nThe defense said earlier this month that when it gets the case, it expects to take about four full days. Now that it will soon be the defense's turn, many have wondered if Read herself will be called as a witness.\n\nWBZ-TV first asked Read on June 13 if she's going to testify and said \"Whatever the lawyers say I need to do, I'll do and I'm willing to go either way.\" On Tuesday, Read was asked after court ended for the day if she has thought about taking the stand.\n\n\"I have. I'd like to fill in some holes and correct some lies, but it's up to the attorneys and they'll make the call probably at the 11th hour and I'm there or not there. I defer to them,\" Read said. \"I'm an outspoken person and I've never not been been able to speak up for myself in my defense except when it matters the most. I've got to rely on them and their expertise and I'll defer to the attorneys.\"\n\nKaren Read is from Mansfield, Massachusetts woman who was dating O'Keefe at the time of his death. According to testimony in the case, the couple had a strained relationship.\n\nOn January 29, 2022, Read dropped O'Keefe off at a house party at 34 Fairview Road in Canton, which was owned at the time by now retired Boston police officer Brian Albert.\n\nWhen O'Keefe did not come home, Read and two other women went out to look for him. They found O'Keefe dead, covered in snow outside of Albert's home.\n\nFirst responders at the scene later testified they heard Read say \"I hit him,\" though defense attorneys have questioned those statements.\n\nRead is charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene of personal injury and death.

(WHDH) - Court proceedings resumed in the Karen Read murder trial without the jury present Tuesday as Judge Beverly Cannone previewed testimony from a series of expert witnesses for the defense.\n\nKnown as voir dire questioning, Tuesday's court session is aimed at helping Cannone decide whether she will allow the witnesses to testify once the defense starts to present its case.\n\nMore than a month into the trial, the session came after a busy day of testimony Monday in which state Trooper Nicholas Guarino testified about arguments between Read and her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, over Facebook Messenger that he encountered while investigating the couple's devices.\n\nHours before O'Keefe died, Guarino said, Read told O'Keefe \"You said terrible things.\"\n\nGuarino said Read said O'Keefe hit her with a pillow when she tried to hug and kiss him on the morning of Jan. 28, one day before O'Keefe died.\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is facing charges including second degree murder after prosecutors said she hit O'Keefe and left him to die after dropping him off outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert.\n\nRead and O'Keefe were dating when O'Keefe died.\n\nRead's defense has said she is being framed, saying O'Keefe was actually beaten to death and attacked by a dog during a party inside the Albert home.\n\nRead's attorneys claim police covered up details and planted evidence to implicate Read in the case. Among allegations, the defense has focused on state police Trooper Michael Proctor as an investigator they say was involved in the alleged cover-up.\n\nRead has pleaded not guilty in the case and maintains her innocence.\n\nRetired ER doctor answers questions\n\nTuesday's first voir dire witness was Dr. Marie Russell. A retired emergency room doctor and a forensic pathologist, Russell had a long career and was a Malden police officer in the 1970s after doing pre-medical work at MIT.\n\nShe then worked in southern California as a doctor as a professor. Russell said she believes O'Keefe's arm injuries likely came from a dog attack.\n\nRussell remained on the stand as of around 10 a.m.\n\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

It physically hurts me to see EVERYONE else in their life do things for them and I'm forced to ALWAYS be the bad guy.\n\nRead (1/28/22, 10:09 a.m.) -- I am not the same as everyone else. Most of the time I try to do what is healthy/smart for them. More importantly, I try to support you and what you need. You just lashed out at me and said terrible things. I don't know how you've gotten to this point with me when I'm just trying my hardest. You made your point and continue to beat me down. I have a lot going on too. Physically am falling apart and trying to get answers and help.\n\nRead (1/28/22, 10:10 a.m.) -- I am just your girlfriend. I am not a perfect parent. I am trying very hard and sometimes treat them nothing like I used to.\n\nRead (1/28/22, 2:06 p.m.) -- I don't know what time. Feel kinda out of it. Just trying to clear my head\n\nRead (1/28/22, 2:16 p.m.) -- I feel pretty shitty about how this morning went down. I know you said sorry but it really stung. Esp when I've been trying pretty hard lately. I feel like a loser turning around just coming back over after everything you said.\n\nO'Keefe (1/28/2022, 2:17 p.m.) -- Not sure what else you want me to do. I said I'm sorry and I was outta line. If you prefer to stay home I totally get it\n\nRead (1/28/22, 2:25 p.m.) -- Tell me if you are interested in someone else. Can't think of any other reason you've been like this.\n\nO'Keefe (1/28/2022, 2:25 p.m.) -- Nope\n\nO'Keefe (1/28/2022, 2:26 p.m.) -- Things haven't been great between us for awhile.

But I don't want to keep trying and you keep treating me like this.\n\nRead (1/28/2022, 2:29 p.m.) -- I'm trying to hug and kiss you this morning and you whack me in the face w a pillow.\n\nRead (1/28/2022, 2:30 p.m.) -- Last night you're basically like \"yeah what about??\" when we talk about the future. So why don't you just admit you're not into it so much anymore?\n\nO'Keefe (1/28/2022, 2:32 p.m.) -- Sick of always arguing and fighting. It's been weekly for several months now. So yeh I'm not as quick to jump back into being love dovie as you apparently.\n\nRead (1/28/2022, 2:34 p.m.) -- If you're telling me you're interested in someone else, you will never hear from me again. You can have all the space in the world\n\nRead (1/28/2022, 2:35 p.m.) -- You start a rager with me out of nowhere and then tell me you're sick of fighting w me.\n\nO'Keefe (1/28/2022, 2:39 p.m.) -- No Karen. Not sure why you need to announce that you're grabbing a drink but have fun\n\nRead (1/28/2022, 2:46 p.m.) -- Yes John. You give me utter grief this morning. I'd like you to call me for a mins.\n\nRead (1/28/2022, 2:47 p.m.) -- I've been trying to get over the hump w is arguing and now you tell me you're not into things. And you don't want to fight weekly but fly off the handle at 8am w me.

He said the SUV \"accelerated at a high rate of speed\" before it struck O'Keefe and the driver \"subsequently left him at the scene.\"\n\nEven if Read's camera systems were \"covered in snow,\" an \"attentive and reasonable operator would not\" have reversed at such a high rate of speed, he said.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooper_(police_rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trooper (police rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Throttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lexus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Divination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Divination", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading Groups", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/6t1ucb0ZJr_u_EB82tFwE5wZNPQ=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/KRJAQOOW332V37HAP5S7CZAHQA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658667", "eventUri": "eng-9658667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-29", "textStart": 1164, "textEnd": 1171}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

That stop, he said, is when the vehicle struck O'Keefe in a \"sideswipe manner\"\n\nHe said further that O'Keefe would have been struck on his right side \"and he would have been spun out ... projected to the left,\" meaning that he would have been out of the way of the vehicle after the initial hit and thus not further run over as people would be if struck in the center of their mass.\n\n\"With the lacerations from the arm, to the taillight, the dent for the scratches where his hand could be.

Read's attorneys say O'Keefe was actually killed during a fight inside retired Boston police officer Brian Albert's home at 34 Fairview Road in Canton, where his body was found.\n\nMassachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor completed his testimony, which included damaging text messages he sent. The messages included derogatory comments about Read. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey was asked about the testimony, saying she was \"disgusted\" by the texts.\n\nFriday's testimony focused on Read's SUV driving in reverse around the time prosecutors say O'Keefe was killed. An expert also testified about the timing of Jennifer McCabe's Google search about how long it would take someone to die in the cold.\n\nThere are full days of court proceedings scheduled on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and a half day on Friday. No court will be held on Wednesday due to the Juneteenth holiday.\n\nThere will be no jurors in the courtroom for Tuesday's proceedings.

When O'Keefe did not come home, and she couldn't get in touch with him, Read and two other women went out to look for him. Around 6 a.m., O'Keefe was found dead, covered in snow.\n\nFirst responders at the scene later testified they heard Read say \"I hit him.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBZ-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WBZ-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Proctor_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Proctor (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maura_Healey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maura Healey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooper_(police_rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trooper (police rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Divination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Divination", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/13/95427ebe-5014-4585-ba5d-beac9a47b775/thumbnail/1200x630/1aabce9328423ee39ff0c1871b1a65e2/read.jpg?v=5842509bb796a146f9b20d3e8b03dac6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658667", "eventUri": "eng-9658667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

(WHDH) - Jurors heard a series of voicemails that Karen Read left for John O'Keefe both before and after he died as Read's murder trial continued in Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham Thursday.\n\nThe voicemails came during testimony from state police Trooper Nicholas Guarino. Testimony, in turn, came after Judge Beverly Cannone ruled two expert witnesses may testify once the defense starts presenting its case.\n\nAfter a day of \"voir dire\" questioning to preview the potential testimony, Cannone did not rule on another potential defense expert, saying she will make her decision at a later date.\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is facing charges including second degree murder after prosecutors said she hit her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, with her car and left him to die after dropping him off outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert in January 2022.\n\nRead's defense has said she is being framed, saying O'Keefe was actually beaten to death and attacked by a dog during a party inside the Albert home.\n\nRead's attorneys claim police covered up details and planted evidence to implicate Read in the case. Among allegations, the defense has focused on state police Trooper Michael Proctor as an investigator they say was involved in the alleged cover-up.\n\nRead has pleaded not guilty in the case and maintains her innocence.\n\nJudge issues ruling on defense witnesses\n\nJurors were last in court on Monday, hearing from a series of witnesses including state Trooper Nicholas Guarino.\n\nThere was a court hearing on Tuesday, but the jury was not present as Cannone heard questioning of the prospective defense witnesses.\n\nCourt was closed on Wednesday due to Juneteenth.\n\nAfter a lengthy sidebar Thursday morning, Cannone said Dr. Marie Russell may testify for the defense. Her testimony will be limited, though, as she will be allowed \"only to opine on whether the marks on the victim's arms are the result of an animal attack.\"\n\nRussell is a retired emergency room doctor and pathologist. She will not be allowed to give her opinions on police activity. She is also barred from giving her opinion on what O'Keefe's injuries are not consistent with, such as road rash or being struck by a vehicle.\n\nContinuing in her ruling, Cannone said accident reconstruction expert Daniel Wolfe may also testify. Wolfe was initially hired by the FBI as part of an ongoing federal probe into the Read investigation.\n\nAlongside Wolfe, federal authorities also hired biomechanical engineer Andrew Rentschler. Cannone said she has concerns about Rentschler, saying Massachusetts law is clear in saying he cannot testify as a biomechanical engineer about medical issues.\n\nCannone said she will reserve judgment on Wolfe and may limit the scope of his testimony once she issues her ruling.\n\nIn the meantime, she said she wanted to proceed with the trial.\n\nState trooper continues testimony\n\nNicholas Guarino on Monday described evidence he saw while going through the cell phones of people linked to the case.\n\nWith air conditioning blasting on another hot and humid day in New England, he retook the witness stand near 9:30 a.m.\n\nGuarino soon discussed text messages between Read and one of O'Keefe's friends, Laura Sullivan, telling Sullivan that O'Keefe had died in the snow.\n\nIn texts, Read said she found O'Keefe at 5 a.m. Sullivan responded, saying she could not stop crying.\n\nAs testimony turned to voicemails, the prosecution introduced one message from 12:37 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2022 -- the morning O'Keefe died.\n\nAfter Read's phone automatically connected to the WiFi at O'Keefe's home, she left a message with O'Keefe saying \"John, I [expletive] hate you.\"\n\nGuarino said Read left eight voicemails across 53 calls between 12:30 a.m. and 6 a.m. Some voicemails appeared to be butt dials or silent. Some messages were very short. Some were very angry.\n\nIn one message, Read called O'Keefe \"a [expletive] pervert\" and told him to \"go [expletive]\" himself.\n\nGuarino said records show O'Keefe never picked up Read's calls.\n\nDefense attorney says prosecution may rest case soon\n\nTwo months into the Read case, Read on Tuesday said she is willing to testify in her own defense. But she said she will leave the decision up to her attorneys.\n\nDefense attorney Alan Jackson said the prosecution may soon rest its case, saying he may begin presenting the defense case as soon as Friday.\n\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

(WHDH) - State police Trooper Joseph Paul was back on the witness stand in the Karen Read murder trial Monday, continuing his testimony after a busy end to the week in the trial last week.\n\nJurors on Friday saw recreations of Read's SUV speeding up in reverse on the morning of Jan. 29, 2022. During Paul's testimony, jurors also saw data showing how quickly she could have reached speeds over 20 miles-per-hour.\n\nCome Monday, Paul faced cross examination and accusations from Read's defense team. Software expert Ian Whiffin testified after Paul, answering questions about a much discussed internet search by one of the people involved in this case.\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is facing charges including second degree murder after prosecutors said she hit Boston police officer John O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die after dropping him off outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert.\n\nRead and O'Keefe were dating when O'Keefe died.\n\nRead's defense has said she is being framed, saying O'Keefe was actually beaten to death and attacked by a dog during a party inside the Albert home.\n\nRead's attorneys claim police covered up details and planted evidence to implicate Read in the case. Among allegations, the defense has focused on state police Trooper Michael Proctor as an investigator they say was involved in the alleged cover-up.\n\nRead has pleaded not guilty in the case and maintains her innocence.\n\nTrooper continues testimony\n\nJoseph Paul, who works with the state police collision analysis and reconstruction unit, said the data he reviewed was consistent with a pedestrian strike, saying this incident could have been a \"side swipe\" strike in which Read hit O'Keefe with the corner of her car.\n\nIn cross examination on Monday, defense attorney Alan Jackson grilled Paul about his knowledge of physics.\n\n\"The truth is, you have no idea what all these physics calculations are, correct?\" Jackson asked.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Adam Lally objected to Jackson's line of questioning and warned Jackson to not continue making statements and remarks through his questions.\n\nPaul said Read's Lexus hit O'Keefe's arm but not his torso. He said the impact broke Read's tail light, leaving scratches on O'Keefe's forearm from pieces of broken plastic. As O'Keefe spun counter clockwise after the collision, Paul said, it is possible he hit is head on the curb.\n\n\"How do you account for the fact he didn't have a broken bone,\" Jackson asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Paul answered.\n\nJackson soon finished his cross examination after accusing Paul of making conclusions that don't make sense because Trooper Michael Proctor told him to. He asked, at one point, if Paul was \"trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\"\n\nSoftware expert testifies\n\nAfter Paul, Ian Whiffin took the stand as the prosecution's 65th witness against Read.\n\nWhiffin is a decoding product manager and former senior digital intelligence expert at Cellebrite, which makes forensic software.\n\nWhiffin examined a search sent by Jennifer McCabe, who has been a focus of questioning from Read's defense team.\n\nMcCabe was at the party at the Albert house the night O'Keefe died and at one point searched \"Hos long to die in cold?\" on the morning of Jan. 29.\n\nThe defense has argued McCabe made the search at 2:27 a.m., hours before O'Keefe's body was found. McCabe and several witnesses have said she made the search later in the day at the urging of Read after Read spotted O'Keefe in the snow.\n\nWhiffin said the search happened at 6:23 a.m., saying \"There's plenty of other evidence\" to show him what was going on.\n\nAt the time the the defense claims the search happened, Whiffin said, McCabe was actually looking up youth sports schedules. Prosecutors said McCabe was home at the time, hours before she learned O'Keefe was missing.\n\nDigital forensic expert Jessica Hyde previously told jurors McCabe's search could have been timestamped at 2:27 a.m., rather than 6:23 a.m., because that was the time when she first opened the tab where she made the search.\n\nWhiffin on Monday said, if Safari is minimized and operating in the background, time stamps are not updated and searches done hours or days later on the same tab can show a previous timestamp.\n\nWhiffin said McCabe was on WiFi looking at sports schedules at 2:27 a.m. Hours later, she used the same Safari tab to look up information about hypothermia. Whiffin said the subsequent search was logged with the older timestamp.\n\nNew state trooper testifies\n\nState trooper Nicholas Guarino testified after Whiffin.\n\nGuarino looked through the evidence in the Read case including the infotainment system from Read's Lexus as well as data from various cell phones and computers.\n\nIn his investigation, Guarino said he was looking log in information for a Ring video system at O'Keefe's house. Jurors heard two important videos are missing from the system, including video of Read's return to O'Keefe's house and video of Read, McCabe and another woman looking at damage to her tail light the morning of Jan. 29.\n\nGuarino said he used \"gray key\" software to break into Read's phone. It took months and he didn't get the passcode until Aug. 16, 2022. Once he got into the phone, though, he said he downloaded the data.\n\nAs he remained on the stand, Guarino refuted opinions from a defense expert who wrote a report saying McCabe deleted calls and a picture of Brian Albert.\n\n\"Most of the stuff was interpreted incorrectly,\" Guarino said.\n\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

They allege Read was driving drunk after a night out and left O'Keefe to die in a blizzard.\n\nHowever, lawyers for the Mansfield woman have suggested O'Keefe's injuries were actually the result of a beating he received after entering the party at 34 Fairview Road. The homeowner at the time was a fellow Boston police officer, and the defense has alleged a widespread coverup involving witnesses and law enforcement.\n\nAs they make their case, prosecutors have pointed to Read's increasingly fraught relationship with O'Keefe as a possible motive. Jurors on Monday heard a series of heated messages the couple exchanged in the hours leading up to O'Keefe's death.\n\n\"Things haven't been great between us for awhile,\" O'Keefe wrote at one point, telling Read he was \"sick of always arguing and fighting.\"\n\nIn texts of her own, Read accused O'Keefe of \"setting [her] up to fail,\" questioned whether he'd developed feelings for someone else, and described the couple's dynamic with O'Keefe's niece and nephew -- who lived with their uncle -- as \"toxic.\"\n\nMonday's court session left off with testimony from Massachusetts State Police Trooper Nicholas Guarino, who spoke about analyzing digital data from several sources, including cellphones belonging to Read, O'Keefe, and witness Jennifer McCabe.\n\nDespite Tuesday's voir dire and Wednesday's Juneteenth holiday, Read's trial appears to be nearing a close. Her attorneys told WBZ they believe the prosecution will wrap up its case this week, leaving the defense free to start its arguments as early as Friday. The defense anticipates about four days of witness testimony, WBZ reported.\n\nCannone has said jurors can expect to begin deliberations sometime in the last week of June.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abby_patkin@boston.com", "name": "Abby Patkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discovery (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_dire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voir dire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Expert witness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBZ_(AM)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WBZ (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooper_(police_rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trooper (police rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Officer_Killed_Girlfriend_Trial_51885-66717cc528733-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658667", "eventUri": "eng-9658667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

They argued that she left him for dead in a snowbank outside another officer's home in the early hours of January 29, 2022.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Read", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karen Read"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk County, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk County, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1718742993_WATCH-LIVE-College-Instructor-'Sweetheart-Karen-Read-Charged-With-Mowing.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658667", "eventUri": "eng-9658667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

(WHDH) - State police Trooper Joseph Paul was back on the witness stand in the Karen Read murder trial Monday, continuing his testimony after a busy end to the week in the trial last week.\n\nJurors on Friday saw recreations of Read's SUV speeding up in reverse on the morning of Jan. 29, 2022. Jurors also saw data showing how quickly she could have reached speeds over 20 miles-per-hour.\n\nPaul followed a series of expert witnesses on Friday and returned to the stand shortly after 9 a.m. on Monday.\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is facing charges including second degree murder after prosecutors said she hit Boston police officer John O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die after dropping him off outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert on Jan. 29, 2022.\n\nRead and O'Keefe were dating when O'Keefe died.\n\nRead's defense has said she is being framed, saying O'Keefe was actually beaten to death and attacked by a dog during a party inside the Albert home.\n\nRead's attorneys claim police covered up details and planted evidence to implicate Read in the case.\n\nRead has pleaded not guilty in the case and maintains her innocence.\n\nTrooper continues testimony\n\nJoseph Paul, who works with the state police collision analysis and reconstruction unit, previously said the data he reviewed was consistent with a pedestrian strike, saying this incident could have been a \"side swipe\" strike in which Read hit O'Keefe with the corner of her car.\n\nHe remained on the witness stand as of around 9:30 a.m. Monday.\n\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

At one point, Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally asked him to read from a series of Facebook Messenger messages between Read and O'Keefe, starting in the afternoon on January 28, 2022. In them, the couple appears to be discussing a fight they had earlier that morning.\n\nHere's a full transcript of the exchanges between Read and O'Keefe shared in court Monday:\n\nKaren Read (9:49 a.m.): You have really hurt me this time\n\nJohn O'Keefe (10:02 a.m.): I'm sorry. This has been an issue w me for 8 years. It physically hurts me to see EVERYONE else in their life do things for them and I'm forced to ALWAYS be the bad guy\n\nRead (10:09 a.m.): I am not the same as everyone else. Most of the time I try to do what is healthy/smart for them. More importantly I try to support you and what you need. You just lashed out at me and said terrible things. I don't know how you've gotten to this point with me when I'm just trying my hardest. You made your point, and continue to beat me down. I have a lot going on too. Physically I am falling apart and trying to get answers and help.\n\nRead (10:10 a.m.): I am just your girlfriend. I am not a perfect parent. I am trying very hard and sometimes treat them - nothing like I used to.\n\nRead (2:06 p.m.): I dont know what time. Feel kinda out of it. Just trying to clear my head\n\nRead (2:16 p.m.): I feel pretty sh**** about how this morning went down. I know you said sorry but it really stung. Esp when I've been trying pretty hard lately. I feel like a loser turning around just coming back over after everything you said.\n\nO'Keefe (2:17 p.m.): Not sure what else you want me to do. I said I'm sorry and I was outta line. If you prefer to stay home I totally get it\n\nRead (2:17 p.m.): Things in my own life have been difficult too you know\n\nO'Keefe (2:17 p.m.): I know\n\nRead (2:25 p.m.): Tell me if you are interested in someone else. Can't think of any other reason you've been like this.\n\nO'Keefe (2:25 p.m.) Nope\n\nO'Keefe (2:26 p.m.): Things haven't been great between us for awhile. Ever consider that?\n\nO'Keefe (2:29 p.m.): Kids are here. Not in the mood to talk\n\nRead (2:29 p.m.): So you're not into it anymore. That's fine. But I don't want to keep trying and you keep treating me like this.\n\nRead (2:29 p.m.): I'm trying to hug and kiss you this morning and you whack me in the face w a pillow\n\nRead (2:30 p.m.): Last night you're basically like \"yeah what about??\" when we talk about the future. So why don't you just admit you're not into so much anymore?\n\nO'Keefe (2:30 p.m.): Not how it went down but ok\n\nRead (2:30 p.m.): Can you pls admit your head is out of the game w us?\n\nO'Keefe (2:32 p.m.): Sick of always arguing and fighting. It's been weekly for several months now. So yeh I'm not as quick to jump back into being lovie dovie as you apparently\n\nO'Keefe (2:33 p.m.): I've explained it a few times already. Not doing it again\n\nRead (2:34 p.m.): If you tell me you're interested in someone else, you will never hear from me again. You can have all the space in the world\n\nRead (2:34 p.m.): Can you please answer ? After how you treated me earlier?\n\nO'Keefe (2:34 p.m.) Kayley is right here\n\nRead (2:35 p.m.): You start a rager with me out of nowhere and then tell me you're sick of fighting w me.\n\nO'Keefe (2:39 p.m.): No Karen. Not sure why you need to announce that you're grabbing a drink but have fun\n\nO'Keefe (2:40 p.m.): Have to take them to the dr. He has practice\n\nRead (2:46 p.m.): Yes John. You gave me utter grief this morning. I'd like you to call me for a mins.\n\nRead (2:47 p.m.): I've been trying to get over the hump w is arguing and now you tell me you're not into things. And you don't want to fight weekly but fly off the handle at 8am w me. Like you're setting me up to fail.\n\nRead (1:04 a.m.): Im back in Mansfield. The kids are home alone\n\nThere is no testimony in the Read trial on Wednesday due to the Juneteenth holiday.

It happened on the southbound travel lane, Paul said.\n\nThe SUV traveled in reverse up to 24 miles per hour and about 62 feet, and the right rear of her Lexus struck O'Keefe, Paul said.\n\nO'Keefe \"projected\" forward and to the left onto the front yard, Paul said, and Read's Lexus continued traveling in reverse before it left the area.\n\n\"There were no mechanical defects,\" Paul said about the collision. \"No roadway or environmental factors that contributed to this collision.\"\n\nEven if the cameras were covered in snow, \"an attentive or reasonable driver\" would not have driven at a high rate of speed in reverse, Paul said.\n\nThe judge struck that comment from the record at the defense's request.\n\nDefense attorney Alan Jackson began cross-examination. Jackson asked Paul about what education degrees he holds.\n\nPaul said he took multiple classes about kinematics, a topic he previously testified about on Friday.\n\nJackson then quizzed Paul about various kinematics topics, at one point asking about constrained and unconstrained motion.\n\nJackson showed a diagram created by the Massachusetts State Police of O'Keefe's \"final rest\" in front of 34 Fairview Road.\n\nThe diagram also showed a debris field where pieces of taillight plastic and O'Keefe's shoe were found. Jackson also showed a photograph of debris in front of a fire hydrant.\n\nPaul agreed with Jackson that the piece of plastic next to the fire hydrant was about 30 feet away from where O'Keefe's body was found.\n\nJackson repeatedly attempted to ask Paul where \"the point of impact\" was, but Paul said it was \"along the roadway\" and did not give a specific point.\n\n\"It's within the roadway based on the evidence at the scene,\" Paul said.\n\nPaul used a laser pointer to draw a line indicating a \"possible area of impact.\"\n\nFrom a potential point of impact along the road near the fire hydrant, Paul said O'Keefe's body was about 30 feet away.\n\nPaul said O'Keefe was \"projected\" or \"pushed forward\" to that spot.\n\n\"There was no evidence he flew through the air,\" Paul said.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Jackson said.\n\nThe prosecution objected and the judge sustained.\n\n\"I don't know how the glass stayed with his body,\" Paul said about the broken pieces of glass found with O'Keefe.\n\nJackson asked for Paul's theory of how his cell phone landed beneath O'Keefe.\n\n\"It just did,\" Paul said. \"That's the evidence at the scene. I didn't put the evidence there.\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't,\" Jackson said. Lally objected and the judge reprimanded Jackson for making statements and not asking questions.\n\nRead, 44, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of O'Keefe, who was found cold to the touch and unresponsive on Jan. 29, 2022, outside of a home in Canton.\n\nNorfolk County prosecutors say Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV while driving intoxicated. Read's attorney, David Yannetti, said during the trial's opening statements that her car never struck O'Keefe and that others are to blame for his death.\n\nThe trial is taking place in Dedham's Norfolk County Superior Court.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi",

But first, some of their potential witnesses will be interviewed Tuesday at Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham so Judge Beverly Cannone can determine what can or cannot be said in front of jurors.\n\nRead is accused of hitting and killing her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow in front of 34 Fairview Road in Canton on Jan. 29, 2022. Her defense says she is the victim of an elaborate coverup involving law enforcement and others.\n\nOne of the defense witnesses is Dr. Marie Russell, who plans to testify that O'Keefe's injuries are consistent with a dog attack. The defense has previously argued that scratches on O'Keefe's arm could have been caused by a German Shepherd mix once owned by Brian Albert.\n\nThe Commonwealth filed a motion to exclude Russell's testimony, saying they were surprised when the defense referenced a dog attack in opening statements. An expert witnesses for the prosecution also testified that samples taken from from O'Keefe's body did not contain canine DNA.\n\nCrash experts for the defense are also expected to be interviewed on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, jurors were shown the last text messages sent between Read and O'Keefe.\n\nOn the morning before O'Keefe's death, Read texted him, \"You have really hurt me this time\" and \"Tell me if you are interested in someone else.\"\n\nO'Keefe denied being interested in another woman and said \"Things haven't been great between us for awhile. Ever consider that?\"\n\nMassachusetts State Police Trooper Nicholas Guarino also read texts from Read in which she said she was back home in Mansfield. But her lawyer said outside of court that she went back to O'Keefe's house.\n\nAlso on Monday, the prosecution called a digital intelligence expert who testified that controversial Google searches by Jennifer McCabe about how long it takes to die in the cold were made after 6:23 a.m., and not 2:27 a.m. as the defense says.\n\nRead is a 44-year-old from Mansfield who was dating O'Keefe at the time of his death.\n\nShe has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene of personal injury and death.", "source":

But prosecutors have said the couple's relationship had deteriorated. After dropping O'Keefe off at the home after having nine drinks, Read left him voicemails in which she \"screamed to the victim that she hated him,\" prosecutors said.\n\nHere are the texts as presented in Norfolk Superior Court.\n\nJan. 28, 2022 -- The couple is discussing O'Keefe's niece and nephew, whom he took in after their parents died.\n\nRead, 9:49 a.m. -- You have really hurt me this time\n\nO'Keefe, 10:02 a.m. -- I'm sorry. This has been an issue w me for 8 years. It physically hurts me to see EVERYONE else in their life do things for them and I'm forced to ALWAYS be the bad guy\n\nRead, 10:09 a.m. -- I am not the same as everyone else. Most of the time I try to do what is healthy/smart for them. More importantly I try to support you and what you need. You just lashed out at me and said terrible things. I don't know how you've gotten to this point with me when I'm just trying my hardest. You made your point, and continue to beat me down. I have a lot going on too. Physically I am falling apart and trying to get answers and help.\n\nRead, 10:10 a.m. -- I am just your girlfriend. I am not a perfect parent. I am trying very hard and sometimes treat them -- nothing like I used to.\n\nRead, 2:06 p.m. -- I don't know what time. Feel kinda out of it. Just trying to clear my head\n\nRead, 2:16 p.m. -- I feel pretty [expletive] about how this morning went down. I know you said sorry but it really stung. Esp when I've been trying pretty hard lately. I feel like a loser turning around just coming back over after everything you said.\n\nO'Keefe, 2:17 p.m. -- Not sure what else you want me to do. I said I'm sorry and I was outta line. If you prefer to stay home I totally get it\n\nRead, 2:17 p.m. -- Things in my own life have been difficult too you know.\n\nO'Keefe, 2:17 p.m. -- I know\n\nRead, 2:25 p.m. -- Tell me if you are interested in someone else. Can't think of any other reason you've been like this.\n\nO'Keefe, 2:25 p.m. -- Nope\n\nO'Keefe, 2:26 p.m. -- Things haven't been great between us for awhile. Ever consider that?\n\nO'Keefe, 2:29 p.m. -- Kids are here. Not in the mood to talk\n\nRead, 2:29 p.m. -- So you're not into it anymore. That's fine. But I don't want to keep trying and you keep treating me like this.\n\nRead, 2:29 p.m. -- I'm trying to hug and kiss you this morning and you whack me in the face w a pillow.\n\nRead, 2:30 p.m. -- Last night you're basically like \"yeah what about??\" when we talk about the future. So why don't you just admit you're not into it so much anymore?\n\nO'Keefe, 2:30 p.m. -- Not how it went down but ok\n\nRead, 2:30 p.m. -- Can you pls admit your head is out of the game w us?\n\nO'Keefe, 2:32 p.m. -- Sick of always arguing and fighting. It's been weekly for several months now. So yeh I'm not as quick to jump back into being lovie dovie as you apparently.\n\nO'Keefe, 2:32 p.m. -- Omg!! Stop calling\n\nCiting call logs from their phones, Guarino testified that Read called O'Keefe 18 times between 9:19 a.m. and 2:59 p.m. on Jan. 28. Eleven of those calls were rejected, four were missed, and three were answered, he said. Read continued to call O'Keefe after he asked her to stop, Guarino said. O'Keefe called her back at about 3 p.m.\n\nO'Keefe, 2:33 p.m. -- I've explained it a few times already. Not doing it again\n\nRead, 2:34 p.m. -- If you tell me you're interested in someone else, you will never hear from me again. You can have all the space in the world.\n\nO'Keefe sends Read another message at 2:34 p.m. but it contained no content.\n\nRead, 2:34 p.m. -- Can you please answer ?

Not sure why you need to announce that you're grabbing a drink but have fun\n\nO'Keefe, 2:40 p.m. -- Have to take them to the dr. He has practice\n\nRead, 2:46 p.m. -- Yes John. You gave me utter grief this morning. I'd like you to call me for a mins.\n\nRead, 2:47 p.m. -- I've been trying to get over the hump w is arguing and now you tell me you're not into things. And you don't want to fight weekly but fly off the handle at 8am w me. Like you're setting me up to fail.\n\nRead, 7:42 p.m. -- I'm waiting for the plumber! -- I actually think he's in the driveway\n\nO'Keefe, 7:43 p.m. -- We're taking mikes car so I'm relying on you for a ride home if he leaves.\n\nMike is an apparent reference to Michael Camerano, O'Keefe's friend.\n\nO'Keefe, 7:44 p.m. -- You have a plumber coming over at 8:00 knowing me and papa could have handled it. Good luck\n\nRead, 8:29 p.m. -- Yeah but he lives right down the road\n\nO'Keefe, 8:30 p.m. -- Karen this storm is gonna be intense. Can't drive\n\nRead, 8:31 p.m. -- Ha! I better not still have this problem on Monday.\n\nO'Keefe, 8:31 p.m. -- You plan on being there?\n\nRead, 8:32 p.m. -- I'd to know I can take a hot shower here if I need to\n\nO'Keefe, 8:32 p.m. -- Figured you'd be in canton til Monday.\n\nO'Keefe, 8:32 p.m. -- I'm getting off my phone.

The trial also took a break Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday.\n\nMassachusetts State Police Trooper Nicholas Guarino is expected back on the stand for additional testimony. On Monday, Guarino testified about analyzing digital data from sources including cellphones belonging to Read, John O'Keefe, and witness Jennifer McCabe. He also read aloud a series of heated messages Read and O'Keefe exchanged in the hours leading up to O'Keefe's death on Jan. 29, 2022.\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is accused of backing her Lexus SUV into O'Keefe -- a Boston police officer and her boyfriend of two years -- after a night of bar hopping. Prosecutors allege Read drunkenly and intentionally struck O'Keefe while dropping him off at an afterparty in Canton, then left him to die in the snow.\n\nYet Read's lawyers say she's being framed and that O'Keefe's injuries were actually the result of a beating he received after walking into 34 Fairview Road. They've also suggested O'Keefe could have been attacked by the homeowner's dog, a German shepherd mix named \"Chloe.\"\n\nDuring voir dire questioning Tuesday, defense expert Dr. Marie Russell, a retired emergency physician and forensic pathologist, said she believes the abrasions on O'Keefe's right arm were the result of animal bites or scratches.\n\n\"They are consistent with a large dog attack,\" Russell said. \"There's a combination of both what I consider bite wounds and scratch wounds on the arm.\"\n\nTeri Kun, a forensic scientist with the University of California, Davis Veterinary Genetics Laboratory Forensic Unit, previously testified that swabs taken from O'Keefe's shirt turned up no signs of canine DNA. Judge Beverly Cannone has yet to say whether Russell will be allowed to testify, after prosecutors complained they only received notice of Russell's expected testimony in late May.\n\nProsecutors also raised concerns about expected testimony from two crash reconstructionists hired as part of a federal investigation into the state's handling of Read's case. Daniel Wolfe, director of accident reconstruction at ARCCA Inc., confirmed the private company received select information about the case from the Department of Justice and the FBI.\n\nAndrew Rentschler, vice president and director of biomechanics for ARCCA's Midwest division, said he was specifically tasked with seeing if it was possible to determine how O'Keefe's injuries occurred. Part of that, he said, \"was to determine whether the injuries -- the head injury and the arm injuries -- resulted from contact with the Lexus in this case.\"\n\nThe prosecution and defense went head to head over one specific finding from ARCCA's report, which purportedly read, \"There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the cause of Mr. O'Keefe's skull and brain injuries or the circumstances surrounding the event.\"\n\nAssistant District Attorney Adam Lally questioned whether Rentschler or Wolfe would be qualified to testify to that conclusion. \"That's more of an area of forensic pathology,\" he argued.\n\nDefense attorney Alan Jackson argued the finding was fair game, adding, \"That is well within the scope of their expertise, obviously.\"", "source": {"uri":

He is the case officer for Read's case, the same role he held in the Walshe murder investigation.\n\nRead's defense team is accusing Proctor of having a role in framing Read for the murder of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe.\n\nProctor testified to making several insulting comments about Read over text during the beginning of the investigation into O'Keefe's death. He wrote that he hated one of Read's attorneys and joked about not finding nude photos when he was going through Read's phone. Messages include remarks on Read's medical condition, her \"ass\" and that he hoped Read \"kills herself.\"\n\n\"She's a wack job,\" he wrote in texts according to court. \"Yes, she's a babe. Weird Fall River accent, though. No ass.\"\n\nJurors shook their heads as the texts were read.\n\nProctor testified his \"juvenile\" texts had \"zero impact on the facts and the evidence and the integrity of this investigation.\"\n\nWalshe's attorney, Larry Tipton, told local media outlets that he does not know if Proctor's bias also plays a role in his client's case.\n\nTipton's new motion is to name Proctor as well as other investigators in the Read case.\n\nTipton did not respond to outreach by Newsweek.\n\nThe Massachusetts State Police is still Proctor's employer. He is under an open investigation, however.\n\nGov. Maura Healey said last week she was \"disgusted\" by Proctor's actions, noting that the texts do \"harm\" to the \"integrity of the work men and women across the state police and law enforcement.\"\n\nWho is Karen Read?\n\nRead, 44, is accused of murdering John O'Keefe on Jan. 29, 2022 with her car after he was found dead in a fellow police officer's driveway on Fairview Road after a night out drinking.\n\nRead's defense has argued that she is the victim of an elaborate cover-up, noting wounds and a potential fight O'Keefe had with other officers. The prosecutors, however, have pointed to her drunk driving and alleged conversations including one where she frantically cried that she might have killed O'Keefe.\n\n\"She was framed. Her car never struck O'Keefe,\" said defense attorney David Yannetti in his opening statement. \"She did not cause his death. That means that somebody else did.\"\n\nA Norfolk grand jury had previously indicted Read in 2022 on charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence and leaving the scene of a personal injury and death.\n\nRead and O'Keefe, 46, along with a group of friends went to the Water Bar and Grill in Canton on Jan. 28, 2022. After a night of drinking, according to prosecutors, Read drove O'Keefe to Boston police officer Brian Albert's home.\n\nAround 1 a.m. on Jan. 29, Read allegedly left O'Keefe a voicemail that called him an \"f---ing loser.\" Read allegedly told O'Keefe \"John, I f---ing hate you.\"\n\nA few hours later at 4:23 a.m., O'Keefe's niece called Albert's sister-in-law, telling him Read was \"distraught\" because O'Keefe did not come home and wasn't answering his cellphone.\n\nRead and two women went looking for O'Keefe shortly after 5 a.m.\n\nAround 6 a.m., Read sees O'Keefe lying in the snow outside of Albert's home. An emergency responder said Read was hysterical and inconsolable and kept repeating \"I hit him.\"\n\nProsecutors said the medical examiner ruled O'Keefe's cause of death as hypothermia as well as blunt impact injuries to the head.\n\nOpening statements and testimony started on April 29. There are full days of court proceedings scheduled this week on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday with a half day on Friday.\n\nNo jurors will be present in the courtroom Tuesday as attorneys question potential defense witnesses to determine if they are allowed to testify.\n\nThe Brian Walshe case\n\nWalshe was arrested and indicted by a Norfolk County grand jury on charges of first-degree murder, misleading a police investigation and the improper conveyance of a human body.\n\nHis wife Ana Walshe went missing on New Year's Day in 2023. The 39-year-old mom to three children was supposed to leave her family home in Cohasset, Massachusetts to travel to Washington, D.C. for work.\n\nShe was reported missing on Jan. 4 when her worried co-workers called the police.\n\nWalshe has denied killing his wife. He told police she had flown to D.C. for a work emergency.\n\nHe instead said he was taking his son out for ice cream on Jan. 2. Police, however, allege he was captured on surveillance footage buying over $400 of cleaning supplies. They also said that a damaged knife and traces of blood were found in the family's basement.\n\nInternet searches on a family iPad were for \"how long before a body starts to smell?\" \"Can you be charged with murder without a body?\" as well as \"10 ways to dump a body.\" There was also apparently a search on the effects of ammonia on a corpse.\n\nProsecutors said in January 2023 that they believed Ana's remains were thrown in a dumpster in Abington before they were shredded and incinerated.\n\nWalshe was already in an ongoing court case at the time of Ana's disappearance. He was sentenced in February for his role a major art fraud scheme involving two so-called Andy Warhol paintings. He was described by a witness as \"a sociopath but also a very angry and physically violent person.\"\n\nHe was sentenced to 37 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and must pay $475,000 in restitution.\n\nExperts said Ana may have been a victim of domestic abuse.\n\nWalshe's next hearing is schedule for 2 p.m. Friday in Norfolk Superior Court on Friday.\n\nThe District Attorney's Office told Newsweek Walshe is not expected to appear physically in court. It will be an \"administrative date relative to scheduling and discovery.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

'I defer to them.'\n\nSmiling, Read went on to explain why she would like to take the stand.\n\n'I'm an outspoken person and I've never not been able to speak up for myself in my defense except when it matters most,' she said.\n\n'I've got to rely on them and their expertise,' Read said of her defense team. 'I'll defer to the attorneys.'\n\nRead's appearance outside the courthouse on Tuesday came as attorneys on both sides were arguing whether to allow certain defense witnesses.\n\nThey subjected the potential witnesses to questioning without a jury, as the trial is set to continue with the prosecution wrapping up its case on Thursday.\n\nBut Read derided the arguments the prosecution has made thus far, telling reporters on Tuesday: 'There is no case against me.\n\n'After eight weeks, it's smoke and mirrors, and it's going through my private life and trying to contrive a motive that was never there.'\n\nO'Keefe's was found unconscious in a snowbank outside a house Read dropped him off at the night before, with skull fractures, swollen eyes and hypothermia at around 6am on January 29, 2022.\n\nHe and Read had earlier gone out to celebrate the acceptance of his niece into private school, and footage from one of the bars, CR McCarthy's in Boston, showed her embracing O'Keefe - hugging and kissing the man she is accused of killing just hours later.\n\nBut prosecutors claim Read and O'Keefe's relationship had been on the rocks amid allegations he was cheating and tensions over the two children in O'Keefe's care - his orphaned niece and nephew.\n\nThey claim she then hit O'Keefe outside of the house party with her SUV that night and left him to die - pointing to fragments from her car that were left at the scene.\n\nProsecutors have also claimed that witnesses at the scene heard Read yell 'I hit him!' when she and two friends found his body, along with 'this is my fault. I did this.'\n\nRead's defense, however, was able to get cops to acknowledge they never actually heard her say she hit O'Keefe, who was a 16-year veteran of the Boston Police Department.\n\nDefense attorneys also refuted the idea there was trouble with the relationship, with O'Keefe's friends at the bar testifying that the couple seemed content that night.\n\nInstead, they claim O'Keefe was beaten up by people at the party and thrown outside where he died on the lawn.\n\nThey argue that the police did not then properly investigate O'Keefe's death, and have singled out Massachusetts State Trooper Lt. Michael Proctor for his close relationship with a number of law enforcement connected to the case - including the owner of the home where O'Keefe was found, Brian Albert.\n\nProctor, who led the investigation into O'Keefe's death, has since admitted in court to sending text messages disparaging Read and denying that Albert would face any repercussions.\n\nHe called Read a 'whack job' and a 'cunt' and referred to her as a 'babe' with 'no ass,' while also making light of her 'Fall River accent' in some text messages to friends, while in others he joked about rummaging through her phone for nude photos during the course of the investigation.\n\nIn other messages, Proctor texted his friends that there will 'be some serious charges brought on the girl,' referring to Read.\n\nHe claimed in the messages that Read 'waffled him' and that 'she hit him with her car,' according to the Boston Globe.\n\n'We're going to lock this whack job up,' he wrote in one of the messages.\n\nOn the stand last week, Proctor repeatedly apologized for the text messages, calling it 'poor language' that had 'no bearing' on the investigation.\n\nHe said that 'these juvenile, unprofessional comments had zero impact on the facts, the evidence and the integrity of the investigation.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

'I'll defer to the attorneys.'\n\nRead's appearance outside the courthouse on Tuesday came as attorneys on both sides were arguing whether to allow certain defense witnesses.\n\nThey subjected the potential witnesses to questioning without a jury, as the trial is set to continue with the prosecution wrapping up its case on Thursday.\n\nBut Read derided the arguments the prosecution has made thus far, telling reporters on Tuesday: 'There is no case against me.\n\n'After eight weeks, it's smoke and mirrors, and it's going through my private life and trying to contrive a motive that was never there.'\n\nJohn O'Keefe, a 16-year Boston cop, was found dead around 6am on January 29, 2022, outside a house where Read dropped him off for an afterparty around 12.45am\n\nProsecutors have claimed Read and O'Keefe's relationship was on the rocks at the time\n\nO'Keefe's was found unconscious in a snowbank outside a house Read dropped him off at the night before, with skull fractures, swollen eyes and hypothermia at around 6am on January 29, 2022.\n\nHe and Read had earlier gone out to celebrate the acceptance of his niece into private school, and footage from one of the bars, CR McCarthy's in Boston, showed her embracing O'Keefe - hugging and kissing the man she is accused of killing just hours later.\n\nBut prosecutors claim Read and O'Keefe's relationship had been on the rocks amid allegations he was cheating and tensions over the two children in O'Keefe's care - his orphaned niece and nephew.\n\nThey claim she then hit O'Keefe outside of the house party with her SUV that night and left him to die - pointing to fragments from her car that were left at the scene.\n\nThe two had gone out drinking at a Boston bar before she dropped him off at the party\n\nProsecutors have also claimed that witnesses at the scene heard Read yell 'I hit him!' when she and two friends found his body, along with 'this is my fault. I did this.'\n\nRead's defense, however, was able to get cops to acknowledge they never actually heard her say she hit O'Keefe, who was a 16-year veteran of the Boston Police Department.\n\nDefense attorneys also refuted the idea there was trouble with the relationship, with O'Keefe's friends at the bar testifying that the couple seemed content that night.\n\nInstead, they claim O'Keefe was beaten up by people at the party and thrown outside where he died on the lawn.\n\nThey argue that the police did not then properly investigate O'Keefe's death, and have singled out Massachusetts State Trooper Lt. Michael Proctor for his close relationship with a number of law enforcement connected to the case - including the owner of the home where O'Keefe was found, Brian Albert.\n\nMassachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor admitted last week to sending text messages disparaging Read\n\nProctor, who led the investigation into O'Keefe's death, has since admitted in court to sending text messages disparaging Read and denying that Albert would face any repercussions.\n\nHe called Read a 'whack job' and a 'cunt' and referred to her as a 'babe' with 'no ass,' while also making light of her 'Fall River accent' in some text messages to friends, while in others he joked about rummaging through her phone for nude photos during the course of the investigation.\n\nIn other messages, Proctor texted his friends that there will 'be some serious charges brought on the girl,' referring to Read.\n\nHe claimed in the messages that Read 'waffled him' and that 'she hit him with her car,' according to the Boston Globe.\n\n'We're going to lock this whack job up,' he wrote in one of the messages.\n\nOn the stand last week, Proctor repeatedly apologized for the text messages, calling it 'poor language' that had 'no bearing' on the investigation.\n\nHe said that 'these juvenile, unprofessional comments had zero impact on the facts, the evidence and the integrity of the investigation.'",

(WHDH) - Judge Beverly Cannone on Thursday ruled two expert witnesses may testify once the defense starts presenting its case in the ongoing Karen Read murder trial.\n\nAfter a day of \"voir dire\" questioning to preview the potential testimony, Cannone did not rule on another potential defense expert, saying she will make her decision at a later date.\n\nTestimony soon resumed as the prosecution looks to wrap up its case more than two months into Read's trial.\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is facing charges including second degree murder after prosecutors said she hit her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, with her car and left him to die after dropping him off outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert in January 2022.\n\nRead's defense has said she is being framed, saying O'Keefe was actually beaten to death and attacked by a dog during a party inside the Albert home.\n\nRead's attorneys claim police covered up details and planted evidence to implicate Read in the case. Among allegations, the defense has focused on state police Trooper Michael Proctor as an investigator they say was involved in the alleged cover-up.\n\nRead has pleaded not guilty in the case and maintains her innocence.\n\nJudge issues ruling on defense witnesses\n\nJurors were last in court on Monday, hearing from a series of witnesses including state Trooper Nicholas Guarino.\n\nThere was a court hearing on Tuesday, but the jury was not present as Cannone heard questioning of the prospective defense witnesses.\n\nCourt was closed on Wednesday due to Juneteenth.\n\nAfter a lengthy sidebar Thursday morning, Cannone said Dr. Marie Russell may testify for the defense. Her testimony will be limited, though, as she will be allowed \"only to opine on whether the marks on the victim's arms are the result of an animal attack.\"\n\nRussell is a retired emergency room doctor and pathologist. She will not be allowed to give her opinions on police activity. She is also barred from giving her opinion on what O'Keefe's injuries are not consistent with, such as road rash or being struck by a vehicle.\n\nContinuing in her ruling, Cannone said accident reconstruction expert Daniel Wolfe may also testify. Wolfe was initially hired by the FBI as part of an ongoing federal probe into the Read investigation.\n\nAlongside Wolfe, federal authorities also hired biomechanical engineer Andrew Rentschler. Cannone said she has concerns about Rentschler, saying Massachusetts law is clear in saying he cannot testify as a biomechanical engineer about medical issues.\n\nCannone said she will reserve judgment on Wolfe and may limit the scope of his testimony once she issues her ruling.\n\nIn the meantime, she said she wanted to proceed with the trial.\n\nState trooper continues testimony\n\nNicholas Guarino on Monday described evidence he saw while going through the cell phones of people linked to the case.\n\nWith air conditioning blasting on another hot and humid day in New England, he retook the witness stand near 9:30 a.m.\n\nGuarino soon discussed text messages between Read and one of O'Keefe's friends, Laura Sullivan, telling Sullivan that O'Keefe had died in the snow.\n\nIn texts, Read said she found O'Keefe at 5 a.m. Sullivan responded, saying she could not stop crying.\n\nDefense attorney says prosecution may rest case soon\n\nTwo months into the Read case, Read on Tuesday said she is willing to testify in her own defense. But she said she will leave the decision up to her attorneys.\n\nDefense attorney Alan Jackson said the prosecution may soon rest its case, saying he may begin presenting the defense case as soon as Friday.\n\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

But whether that will be enough to forward the prosecution's case remains to be seen.\n\nRead is accused of hitting and killing O'Keefe with her SUV in front of a home in Canton, Massachusetts. Her defense maintains she is being framed as part of a large-scale coverup.\n\nThe messages were revealed during the testimony of Massachusetts State Police forensic expert Trooper Nicholas Guarino Monday afternoon.\n\nGuarino was involved in extracting and reviewing data from four of the cell phones involved in the case - the ones belonging to Read, O'Keefe, and Jennifer McCabe and Kerry Roberts. At one point, Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally asked to read from a series of Facebook messenger messages between Read and O'Keefe, starting in the afternoon on January 28, 2022. In them, the couple appears to be discussing a fight they had earlier in the morning.\n\n\"I feel pretty sh---y about how this morning when down,\" Read wrote. I know you said sorry but it really stung. Esp when I've been trying pretty hard lately. I feel like a loser turning around and just coming back over after everything you said,\" Read wrote at 2:16 p.m.\n\n\"Not sure what else you want me to do. I said I'm sorry and I was outta line. If you prefer to stay home I totally get it,\" O'Keefe responded at 2:17 p.m\n\nThe exchange continued and gets heated, with Read pressing O'Keefe to tell her if he was interested in something else.\n\nO'Keefe denies being interested in anyone else, adding, \"Things haven't been great between us for awhile. Ever consider that?\" at 2:26 p.m.\n\nPhone records show Read attempted to call O'Keefe multiple times in that timeframe, despite multiple messages from O'Keefe telling her not to call, and that he was not going to pick up. According to Guarino's testimony on the phone records, there were 18 calls from Read to O'Keefe between 9:19 a.m. and 2:59 p.m. - 11 of them were rejected, four were missed, and three were answered. At around 3 p.m., O'Keefe calls Read back.\n\nThe conversation moved to other topics, including the impending winter storm and their plans for the evening. The last of the messages Gurino read were sent by Read to O'Keefe in the early morning hours before his body was found.\n\nThe last two messages come through shortly after.\n\n\"Your kids are (expletive) ALONE,\" she wrote at 1:02 a.m.\n\n\"Im back in Mansfield. The kids are home alone,\" said the final message Guarino read.\n\nLegal expert Katherine Loftus said the text messages provide context, but she didn't see anything that she believes shows the intent that the prosecution would need to prove for a second-degree murder charge.\n\n\"It gives a little bit more context because what we've heard is a lot of testimony about different witnesses who talked about their good relationship and I think, as anyone knows, the public-facing relationship is often very different than the private relationship,\" Loftus said.\n\nWatch the Karen Read trial live on nbcboston.com, NECN, NBC Boston streaming platforms (including Roku, Peacock and Samsung TV) and NBC10 Boston's YouTube page. Every night of the trial at 7 p.m., come back for analysis and more.\n\nEmail questions to canton.confidential@nbcuni.com.\n\n\"Do I think it proves why she wanted to allegedly kill him or hit or him the intent? No I don't,\" she told NBC10 Boston's Glenn Jones.\n\nNBC10 Boston's Sue O'Connell, who has been in the courtroom for the trial, said the jury was paying close attention as Guarino read the messages and how they're taken will depend on individual bias.\n\n\"If you'd had relationships with this, like this, you might think it's normal or you think it's just somebody who acts this way,\" O'Connell said. \"If you've never had a relationship where you've broken up or you think someone's cheating on you, or you have issues where you have to call someone a million times or you have to be in a relationship with someone who calls you a million times, it may seem strange. But again, John O'Keefe ended that night dead, by the morning, and that's the tragedy here and that's what shapes the entire text exchange.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooper_(police_rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trooper (police rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Read", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen Read"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winter storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBTS-CD", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WBTS-CD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Cable_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Cable News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCAU", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WCAU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Divination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Divination", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/06/Karen-Read-trial-What-to-take-away-from-Reads-messages-to-OKeefe.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658667", "eventUri": "eng-9658667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

(WHDH) - Two months into the Karen Read murder trial, Read shared her thoughts about the case against her after another day in court Tuesday.\n\n\"How do I feel about the case against me?\" she told reporters. \"There is no case against me.\"\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is facing charges including second degree murder after prosecutors said she hit Boston police officer John O'Keefe and left him to die after dropping him off outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert.\n\nRead and O'Keefe were dating when O'Keefe died.\n\nRead's defense has said she is being framed, saying O'Keefe was actually beaten to death and attacked by a dog during a party inside the Albert home.\n\nRead's attorneys claim police covered up details and planted evidence to implicate Read in the case. Read has pleaded not guilty and maintains her innocence.\n\n\"It's smoke and mirrors and it's going through my private life and trying to contrive a motive that was never there,\" Read said Tuesday.\n\nThough the defense is not likely to put Read on the witness stand, she said she is willing.\n\n\"I would like to fill in some holes and correct some lies,\" she said. \"But it's up to the attorneys and they will make the call probably at the 11th hour and I'm there or not there.\"\n\nRead was in Norfolk Superior Court for Tuesday's proceedings. But the jury had the day off as Judge Beverly Cannone previewed testimony from a series of experts the defense is seeking to call.\n\nDr. Marie Russell, a retired pathologist who also treated patients for animal bites, said she looked at photos of O'Keefe's arm and concluded he was probably bitten and clawed by an animal.\n\n\"They are consistent with a large dog attack,\" she said. \"There's a combination of both what I consider bite wounds and scratch wounds on the arm.\"\n\nRussell came forward after reading about the Read case. In court, Cannone was concerned about that fact as well as Russell's struggles with remembering what evidence she saw.\n\n\"She didn't write a report,\" Cannone said. \"I have to consider all of these things too as the gatekeeper as to whether she can actually assist the jury.\"\n\nTwo accident reconstruction experts who were first hired by the FBI as part of a federal probe into the Read investigation also spoke about their qualifications.\n\nHimself speaking with reporters, defense attorney Alan Jackson said it seemed to him the court was trying to help Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally with his strategy.\n\n\"Judge Cannone is kind of tossing softballs out to Mr. Lally to see if he can hit them out of the park,\" he said. \"I don't even get that. I don't understand it. It doesn't make any sense to me.\"\n\nThere will be no court proceedings on Wednesday due to the Juneteenth holiday.\n\nThe jury will be back in the courtroom on Thursday for more testimony.\n\nCannone is expected to make her decision on Thursday on whether to allow testimony from the defense's three expert witnesses.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

It's a process, according to Cornell Law School's Wex Law Dictionary, in which lawyers perform an initial questioning of \"witnesses (especially experts) to determine their competence to testify.\"\n\nThere have been a few instances throughout the trial, which began April 29, when jurors were dismissed ahead of the end of the day so attorneys could question a witness on a particular or unexpected line of questioning introduced in direct examination. But there hasn't been a full court day dedicated to it.\n\nAttorneys did not announce who would be questioned today.\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, faces charges of second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter and leaving the scene of a collision causing the death of her boyfriend John O'Keefe, a 16-year Boston Police officer when he died at age 46.\n\nText messages between Read and O'Keefe revealed a relationship on the rocks just hours before he was found nearly frozen in a Canton yard.\n\n\"Sick of always arguing and fighting.

People inside the home have testified that neither Read nor O'Keefe came inside.\n\nAs the trial wraps up its eighth week in Norfolk Superior Court, here's a breakdown of some of the key physical and digital forensics that've been presented so far.\n\nTaillight, hair DNA\n\nAuthorities have said Read's right taillight was shattered when she struck O'Keefe, and that pieces of glass and red and clear plastic were found near his body. A hair sample was also recovered from the bumper, according to witnesses.\n\nTess Chart, a DNA analyst with a lab in Virginia, testified last week that the hair's mitochondrial DNA profile was \"consistent with\" O'Keefe's DNA and that analysts could exclude at least 99.8 percent of the population from being the source.\n\nChart's colleague, Nicholas Bradford, told jurors he tested multiple items, including a piece of broken taillight found at the scene and DNA samples from two investigators on the case.\n\nHe said the lab determined \"strong support\" for O'Keefe's DNA being present on the piece of taillight and strong support for the investigators' DNA being excluded. The exclusion of their DNA is significant because Read's lawyers allege that investigators planted evidence and tampered with Read's SUV after seizing it.\n\nTo support that argument, Read's attorneys have cited abnormalities in the video footage of her SUV Lexus being processed inside the Canton police department garage, issues with the chain of custody of certain pieces of evidence, including O'Keefe's clothing, and alleged bias against their client from investigators with social ties to witnesses in the case, as demonstrated by a State Police trooper's crude text messages about Read to friends and coworkers.\n\nDisputed Google search\n\nIan Whiffin, a product manager at Cellebrite, a digital forensics firm, testified Monday about a disputed timestamp on a Google search made by Jennifer McCabe, who was with Read when she discovered O'Keefe's body in heavy snow.\n\nMcCabe, whose sister lived at Fairview Road, previously told jurors that she searched, \"hos long to die in the cold,\" which contains a typo in the first word, shortly after 6:30 a.m at Read's insistence.\n\nRead's defense team has long asserted that cellphone records show the search was made shortly before 2:30 a.m., by which point Read had returned to O'Keefe's home.\n\nBut Whiffin said that time indicated when McCabe first opened her browser tab to search for a youth sports program, not when the hypothermia searches were made.\n\n\"I have no doubt that the only time those two Google searches were conducted\" were at 6:23 a.m. and 6:24 a.m., Whiffin said.\n\nArm injuries\n\nWithout the jury present Tuesday, Judge Beverly Cannone heard testimony from Dr. Marie Russell, a retired emergency room physician and forensic pathologist, to determine whether she'll allow Russell to testify before the jury as a defense expert. Cannone said she'll issue a ruling by Thursday.\n\nRussell testified that the cuts and scratches on O'Keefe's right arm were \"consistent with a large dog attack,\" citing \"parallel wounds\" on his arm she said could have been caused by scratches or teeth, as well as an \"unusual pattern\" of at least four cuts near his wrist that could have come from the front of a canine's mouth.\n\nLast month, prosecutors sought to undercut the defense's dog bite theory by calling Teri Kun, a California veterinary forensic specialist, to the stand. She told the jury that prosecutors sent her lab swabs taken from O'Keefe's shirt to test for possible dog DNA.\n\nKun said results were negative for \"canine DNA,\" though \"for both the swabs we did see pig,\" which she indicated could have come from food such as cooked pork or bacon.\n\nReport commissioned by FBI\n\nAlso Tuesday, Cannone heard testimony out of the jury's presence from representatives of ARCCA, a Pennsylvania-based accident reconstruction company the FBI hired as part of a federal investigation into the state law enforcement handling of the Read case.\n\nThe analysts did not discuss their findings in detail Tuesday, but Read's attorneys have said a sealed report on their work provided to prosecutors and defense counsel before trial found O'Keefe's injuries were \"inconsistent\" with being struck by a motor vehicle. Prosecutors have countered that the analysts essentially found the injury to the back of O'Keefe's head wasn't caused by a motor vehicle, something the government has never alleged.\n\nRead attorney Alan Jackson said the experts are highly qualified to attest that there's \"insufficient evidence to determine\" the cause of O'Keefe's skull and head injuries.\n\n\"It's well within their purview to testify to that,\" Jackson said.\n\nProsecutor Adam Lally said he didn't think \"that was their actual opinion\" about O'Keefe's injuries. Cannone said she'll decide about the proposed testimony by Thursday.\n\nLegal experts weigh in\n\nMartin G. Weinberg, a renowned criminal defense attorney based in Boston, said via email that the evidence presented to date presents challenges for both sides.\n\n\"Jurors expect impartiality and professionalism in a murder investigation,\" Weinberg said in reference to Trooper Michael Proctor's text messages. \"When they see dehumanization of a defendant and a failure to faithfully follow proper practices, acquittals can occur -- and should occur.\"\n\nHe said that whether \"the evidence skillfully elicited by the defense outweighs the strength of the prosecution presentation - its forensic evidence - is one question but whether the defense risks its credibility by strongly embracing the counter-narrative of violence in the home is another,.\"\n\nMark J. Geragos, a criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles who has represented a host of celebrities, said the forensic evidence has been overshadowed by the police misconduct.\n\n\"The forensics battle, while interesting to jurors, will hardly negate the outright corruption already exposed,\" Geragos said in an email. \"As a practical matter jurors tend to cancel out the bought and paid for experts and really focus on what they think actually happened and use the expert to support that determination.\"\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who also served as enforcement director of the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission, said the police misconduct that has come to light could overshadow the prosecution's case.\n\n\"There is plenty of evidence of motive (Read's anger and jealously) and forensic evidence that Read struck O'Keefe with her vehicle (shattered taillight, broken glass, and hair on her vehicle),\" Rahmani, a commentator on the trial for Court TV, said by email. \"Normally, this would be an open-and-shut case of vehicular manslaughter at best, or intentional murder at worst.\"\n\nRahmani said Proctor, the lead investigator in the case, \"was a terrible witness in terms of likability and credibility. His text messages about Read were unprofessional and downright offensive. His was evasive or even lied on the stand when he talked about his relationship with the Alberts [who owned the Fairview home].\"\n\nWhen the lead investigator is so compromised, Rahmani said, \"that may give rise to conspiracy theories about a law enforcement cover-up, planting evidence, and reasonable doubt. This reminds me of Mark Fuhrman and the O.J.

The case has captivated Massachusetts since early 2022, when Read was named the prime suspect in the mysterious death of her police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe. But national and even global interest -- along with a Netflix unscripted project, which Vanity Fair can confirm -- has snowballed as Read's second-degree-murder trial continues.\n\nWhat is undisputed is that in the early morning of January 29, 2022, Read found O'Keefe unresponsive in a snowbank. He was pronounced dead hours later. The cause was later determined to be hypothermia and blunt trauma to the head.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Read backed into him with her Lexus SUV after a fight on January 28, following an evening of drinking, and left the scene. Read, now 44, faces charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene of a personal injury or death.\n\nThe defense proposes something completely different: that Read is being framed by law enforcement officers -- O'Keefe's colleagues and best friends, who were among the last people to see him alive -- and that his death was caused by a violent fight inside a former cop's home. Last week, bombshell testimony from the lead investigator on the case drew gasps from jury members. Outside the courthouse, the six-week trial has inspired discourse so passionate that it has led to derivative criminal charges, a protesting ban, and what a friend of O'Keefe's claims is a \"circus\" overshadowing the real victim. So what is it exactly about the Karen Read case that is hitting such a nerve?\n\nTo begin, it has all the elements of a thriller: a woman accused of murder, an unlikely weapon (a car is less common than poison), an alleged conspiracy involving a powerful law-enforcement family, and the courtroom dynamics of a John Grisham plot. But it's real.\n\nAmong the plot twists: the defense called for Judge Beverly Cannone to recuse herself, alleging that she had ties to people involved in the case. (She denied the request.) Brian Higgins, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, testified about becoming attracted to Read and flirting with her in the weeks before O'Keefe's death. The defense suggested that a friend of O'Keefe's googled \"ho[w] long to die in cold\" at 2:25 a.m., long before O'Keefe's body was found; the prosecution said Read asked her friend to google the phrase in the morning after O'Keefe's body was found.\n\nA zealous local blogger named \"Turtleboy\" allegedly spent over 40 hours directly communicating with Read over the span of 189 phone calls and has been fanning conspiracy-theory flames online. As a result, Turtleboy, a.k.a. Aidan Kearney, has been indicted on over 16 charges including counts of witness intimidation. (Kearney has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty.)\n\nThe conspiracy theories have also gained momentum, says Court TV attorney-journalist and host Julie Grant, because \"the defense team was speaking out about a cover-up prior to trial, while the prosecution stayed nearly silent. Prosecutors are held to a higher ethical standard than private attorneys...and have a duty not to make extrajudicial comments that are likely to heighten public condemnation of a defendant. I think that was largely how the cover-up allegations really started picking up steam.\"\n\nPassions have become so heightened outside the courthouse that Cannone banned protesting within 200 feet of the building and clothing or accessories relating to the case, like \"Free Karen\" T-shirts, inside. (Some supporters have worn pink outside the courthouse, believing it to be Read's favorite color.)\n\n\"The story is the draw,\" says Grant, who hosts Court TV's Opening States with Julie Grant. \"Trial watchers want to know if there truly is a cover-up in Canton, as the defense claims.\" (In a statement to ABC News, the prosecution said, \"There was no conspiracy or cover-up. Such claims have been systematically refuted by evidence submitted to Norfolk Superior Court.\")\n\nAs if there wasn't enough to make the trial a hot-button issue, the lead investigator on the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted in testimony last week to sending misogynistic text messages about Read. In a group text chain with eight of his high school friends, Proctor crassly commented on Read's physical appearance; joked about searching her phone for \"nudes\"; referred to her as a \"babe,\" \"nutbag,\" and \"a whack job\"; and made a crude remark about a medical condition from which Read suffers. In a text message to his sister, Proctor said that he hoped Read killed herself.\n\nProctor called the texts \"unprofessional and regrettable\" and admitted, \"my emotions got the best of me,\" but argued that his remarks \"have zero impact on the facts and the evidence and the integrity of this investigation.\" Still, the lead investigator on the case was asked by the defense whether he dehumanized Read.\n\n\"I would say based off that language, yes,\" Proctor replied.\n\nAfterward, Governor Maura Healey issued a statement saying she was \"disgusted\" by Proctor's behavior and that it put \"the dignity and integrity\" of all state police at risk. Proctor's statements made national headlines, but more intimately, they also seemed to horrify some on the jury, which is made of mostly female members.\n\n\"One woman had her mouth open,\" said NBC10 Boston's Sue O'Connell, who was in the courtroom during Proctor's testimony. \"One woman looked back and looked at every single female juror she could look at to make eye contact...at one point they were just shaking their heads. One woman laughed.\"\n\nIt isn't just the misogyny that seems remarkable, though. At a moment when America is less confident in police than ever before, the idea of unmasking a law-enforcement cover-up is delectable to some skeptics. And testimony from Massachusetts State Police officers about their choices in the investigation might convince cynics that their law-enforcement suspicions are justified.\n\nLast week, Massachusetts State Police Lieutenant Brian Tully testified that investigators did not search the home on the property where O'Keefe's body was found, which belonged to retired police officer Brian Albert, because he did not believe O'Keefe had entered the home. (Proctor texted his friends that the homeowner would not get much blowback from O'Keefe's death because he's \"a Boston cop.\") Blood evidence was gathered in red Solo cups inside a grocery-store bag. Just 17 hours into his investigation into O'Keefe's death, Proctor texted his friends that Read had \"zero chance\" of getting off without punishment. \"She's f-cked,\" he wrote.\n\nAnother officer, meanwhile, acknowledged that he failed to write down key information in his official report. Like the four words \"This is my fault,\" which were not in the report but which the officer claimed Read said. The defense has also alleged that, the night of his death, O'Keefe was injured by a dog the Albert family owned -- a dog that the family rehomed the same month the defense says it began its investigation into O'Keefe's injuries. Brian Albert testified that the dog \"went to the bathroom and ran right back in,\" the night of O'Keefe's death.\n\nBecause Read, a woman, is going up against the Massachusetts State Police, and what some view as an unfair legal system, she's taken on the PR patina of a social justice hero rather than that of a second-degree-murder defendant. It's a role she has played well, appearing mostly stoic and unflappable -- giving reporters a clean sound bite and audiences a compelling star in this extraordinary trial. (Her legal defense fund has raised over $370,000 so far.)\n\nOutside the courtroom last week, Read was asked what she thought of Proctor's damning testimony, in which he admitted to dehumanizing her. The defendant answered how a superhero might: \"He'll have to answer to someone someday.\"\n\nSpeaking about the trial optics, Court TV attorney-journalist Julie Grant commends the defense team. \"They demonstrate confidence at all times. Even when there is damaging testimony implicating Karen Read, they show everyone in the courtroom a winning attitude,\" says Grant. \"It's a smart strategy that jurors notice. The way in which everything and everyone appears matters just as much. She dresses impeccably every day and appears calm when incriminating evidence is introduced against her.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors":

The defense aims to prove that O'Keefe was murdered by someone inside the home and then tossed into the snow.\n\nThe court was not in session Wednesday due to the Juneteenth holiday, but Dr. Marie Russell and crash reconstruction analysts Dr. Daniel Wolfe and Dr. Andrew Rentschler were questioned without jurors present. Cannone said she would rule on what they can say in front of the jury if anything at all.\n\nRussell, a retired emergency room doctor and forensic pathologist, was the first expert witness called to the stand by the defense as part of the voir dire proceedings.\n\nRussell told the court that she spent nearly three decades at Los Angeles General Medical Center and that part of her job was determining the cause of injuries. Russell also spent part of her career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in Malden for seven years.\n\nRussell explained that she reviewed hospital photos of O'Keefe's injuries, as well as his autopsy and toxicology reports, among other documents.\n\nRussell claimed that the combination of cuts and scratches on O'Keefe's arm was \"consistent with a large dog attack,\" not an accident involving a motor vehicle.\n\n\"These injuries on the arm, in my opinion, is that they are the result of an animal -- bites or scratches,\" Russell told Judge Beverly Cannone when asked for additional clarification. \"Most likely a dog, a large dog.\"\n\nWhen Cannone asked her how confident she was in her opinion, Russell responded, \"Very sure\" to a \"high degree of medical certainty.\"\n\nAssistant District Attorney Adam Lally proceeded to ask Cannone to block Russell from testifying, suggesting she tried to interject herself in the case and saying the defense brought her in too late.\n\nCannone instructed Lally to find a rebuttal witness in case she allows Russell to testify. Lally agreed and said that it could be done in a week.\n\nWolfe, an expert hired by federal investigators to conduct an accident reconstruction in the Read case, said his firm found O'Keefe's injuries did not appear to be from a car strike.\n\nWolfe said he and two of his colleagues reviewed the case, including police reports, crime scene and autopsy photos, and data related to Read's SUV.\n\nRentschler is an accident deconstructionist who specializes in biomechanical engineering.\n\nRentschler told the court that he's performed \"a number of crash and sled tests\" and his work on the Read case centered around biomechanical engineering analysis of O'Keefe's injuries.\n\nRead has pleaded not guilty to charges including second-degree murder in O'Keefe's death.\n\nThe prosecution is expected to wrap up its case by the end of this week. The defense will then present its case.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_General_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles General Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_dire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voir dire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Expert witness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malden,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malden, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malden, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biomechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/wfxt_cox_articles_703/4e94e429692fb30c563ddf471ac4abd9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658667", "eventUri": "eng-9658667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

But it's now making national and even international headlines and has gone viral on social media.\n\nEvidence in the case has created a nationwide armchair symposium of online sleuths with thousands sharing theories on social media and in podcasts.\n\nIt is now nearly impossible to get a seat in the courtroom, as it was during the O.J. Simpson murder trial almost 30 years ago.\n\nMr. Simpson, who recently died, was accused of stabbing to death his wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman in 1994. The eight-month-long Simpson trial, which was televised nationally, drew 150 million daily viewers. It ended with Mr. Simpson's acquittal, leaving a nation divided over whether the verdict was fair.\n\nThe Simpson trial set the benchmark for sensational, real-life courtroom dramas.\n\nWhile the Karen Read trial certainly hasn't drawn anywhere near as much attention, several media outlets are now carrying daily updates and some platforms are providing livestreams.\n\nThere is even a movement to wear pink, Ms. Read's favorite color, to show support for her.\n\nThere is also a daily encampment with people wearing shirts saying \"Free Karen Read\" and holding signs in support of the 46-year-old former college lecturer.\n\nGalina Davidoff, a Boston-based trial consultant, and Richard Gabriel, a Los Angeles-based jury consultant who has worked on several high-profile cases including the O.J. Simpson trial, both noted that Ms. Read's physical attributes are likely playing a role.\n\n\"She's attractive and she's white,\" said Mr. Gabriel, pointing to similar popular murder trials. The Casey Anthony case involved a white mom accused of killing her toddler daughter Caylee in Orlando, Florida in 2008. She was found not guilty in 2011. Scott Peterson, a handsome white husband, was convicted of the killing of his pregnant wife Laci in 2002 in the affluent suburban city of Modesto, California.\n\nMs. Davidoff noted that Ms. Read is a \"good-looking woman\" who appears educated with no history of drugs.\n\n\"People can relate to her,\" she said, likening the trial's growing popularity to the 1997 trial of young English nanny Louise Woodward, who was accused of killing a baby, Matthew Eappen, by shaking him to death.\n\nThe Woodward trial, which also took place in Massachusetts, had unanswered questions including viable alternative suspects that got a \"whole world\" speculating about evidence, said Ms. Davidoff.\n\nShe and Mr. Gabriel also said the Read trial is unfolding against the backdrop of a \"nasty\" and \"toxic\" political climate in the United States and abroad.\n\n\"The world is looking for a distraction,\" said Mr. Gabriel.\n\n\"There's so much international news that is depressing, our entertainment option is kind of to sit at home and watch a variety of TV series, then comes this real-life suspense story. ... You can actually go down to the courthouse and see the crowds. ...It is a unique, strange type of entertainment.\"\n\nWhile he said he didn't think the Karen Read trial will reach the popularity level of the O.J. Simpson trial, he said he was \"impressed\" that talk about it had reached the West Coast.\n\nHe said it reminded him a bit of the days when villagers would gather to watch public hangings. \"It was seen as entertainment,\" he said.\n\nMs. Davidoff said the Read trial also has a \"uniting\" element because people can agree to disagree over evidence and the credibility of a witness, without it becoming personal.\n\n\"As awful as it might sound, people are bonding over this the way they used to over issues that now divide us,\" she said.\n\nThe case involves a love triangle among Ms. Read, a Boston police officer, and an Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agent. There are also many odd details, such as inexplicably missing video footage from a Ring camera. Also, a Google search about cold weather morbidity that suggests a potential conspiracy and cover-up.\n\n\"You've got yourself a real-life whodunnit,\" said Mr. Gabriel.\n\nThe late Mr. O'Keefe has been described by many as an exemplary police officer. The 44-year-old served 16 years in law enforcement. When his sister and her husband died, he took in his niece and nephew.\n\nThe prosecution said Ms. Read and Mr. O'Keefe never made it inside the home. Instead, they got into a fight and Ms. Read rammed her car into Mr. O'Keefe, ran him over, and then left him for dead in heavy snowfall, the prosecution alleges. The prosecution presented texts between the couple showing their relationship was strained.\n\nMs. Read, who suffers from Crohn's Disease, has always maintained that she dropped off Mr. O'Keefe outside the Alberts' home because she wasn't feeling well.\n\nThe defense has argued that Mr. O'Keefe was killed inside the Albert home in a fight between him and ATF agent Brian Higgins, who was identified during the trial as a friend of Mr. Albert.\n\nAs part of the allegations, the defense presented an exchange of flirtatious texts between Mr. Higgins and Ms. Read.\n\nThe defense also presented texts showing that Mr. Higgins had invited Mr. O'Keefe to the afterparty. Several witnesses also testified seeing him practicing sparring at the bar where they all were earlier.\n\nThe defense also asserted that deep puncture wounds on Mr. O'Keefe's arms were caused by the Alberts' German Shepherd dog when she attacked Mr. O'Keefe during the altercation.\n\nA prosecution expert said the wounds were not consistent with dog bites, but the Alberts did acknowledge under cross-examination that they \"re-homed\" their dog out of state after Mr. O'Keefe was found dead outside their home.\n\nThe defense's theory is that after realizing Mr. O'Keefe was mortally wounded, Mr. Higgins, the Alberts, and others in the house dragged Mr. O'Keefe outside and left him there.\n\nAs part of the theory, the defense presented evidence that at 2:23 a.m. Nicole Albert's sister Jennifer McCabe, who was at the afterparty with her husband -- also a Boston cop -- googled \"hos [sic] long to die in the cold.\"\n\nThe timeline is critical because witnesses including the McCabes said they saw Ms. Read arrive at the Alberts about two hours earlier and leave without getting out of her SUV. They also said they never saw Mr. O'Keefe get out of the car.\n\nThe prosecution countered the evidence with testimony from a computer analyst saying the search could have been part of a computer search tab that Ms. McCabe opened at 2:23 a.m. but that she did not specifically search for how long it took someone to die in the cold until hours later.\n\nDuring her direct testimony, Ms. McCabe said it was Ms. Read who asked her to search for how long it takes to die around 6 a.m. when they found Mr. O'Keefe lying on the ground at the Alberts' home.\n\nAdding to the mystery behind the Google search is evidence the defense presented that Mr. Albert made a phone call to Mr. Higgins around 2:30 a.m., around the same time that the defense alleges Ms. McCabe researched how long it would take for someone to die in the cold. Mr. Albert testified that the call was a butt dial [an unintended call].\n\nMr. Higgins, Ms. McCabe, and the Alberts all have denied any involvement in Mr. O'Keefe's death and said they never saw him enter the Alberts' home that night.\n\nAnother major sticking point that has garnered worldwide attention is pieces of a tail light found by Massachusetts state trooper Michael Proctor, who served as the lead investigator. He said he had found it at the Alberts' weeks after Mr. O'Keefe's body was found there.\n\nCamera footage presented by the defense appears to show Ms. Read's tail light intact after she is alleged to have hit Mr. O'Keefe.\n\nTestimony in the trial showed that the state trooper had personal relationships with both the Alberts and the McCabes and some of their family members and that some of their children were also friends. Among texts Mr. Proctor sent out in a group chat about the investigation, he wrote that Brian McCabe was \"not going to get any [expletive] because he's a cop.\"\n\nThe defense also presented texts the state trooper sent to others making crude comments about Ms. Read. Some of the jurors could be heard gasping in response.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called the texts \"disgusting,\" which gave fuel to critics who have called for Mr. Proctor to be fired.\n\nBoth Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Davidoff say that allegations of a police cover-up have also likely played a major role in the growing popularity of the trial.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_trial_of_O._J._Simpson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder trial of O.

Will Karen Read testify at her own murder trial?\n\nThe prosecution has been making its case since testimony got underway April 29. The prosecution is nearing the conclusion of its witness list, and could rest its case by the end of this week.\n\nRead is accused of second-degree murder - among other charges - for the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe.\n\nProsecutors say she hit him with her SUV outside 34 Fairview Road in Canton during a snowstorm after a night of drinking. The two had been going to the Canton home for a gathering after a night at bars with friends, but witnesses have testified that neither entered the home.\n\nRead's defense team says she's the innocent victim of a police cover up. They believe O'Keefe was actually killed in a fight inside the home, his body then dumped on the front lawn.\n\nNow that it will soon be the defense's turn, many who are glued to this case are wondering if Karen Read plans to take the stand.\n\nWBZ-TV first asked Read on June 13 if she's going to testify.\n\n\"Whatever the lawyers say I need to do, I'll do and I'm willing to go either way,\" Read said.\n\nOn June 18, Read was asked if she thought about taking the stand.\n\n\"I have. I'd like to fill in some holes and correct some lies, but it's up to the attorneys and they'll make the call probably at the 11th hour and I'm there or not there. I defer to them,\" Read said. \"I'm an outspoken person and I've never not been been able to speak up for myself in my defense except when it matters the most. I've got to rely on them and their expertise and I'll defer to the attorneys.\"\n\nIt's \"highly unusual\" for a defendant to testify at their own murder trial, defense attorney Phil Tracy told WBZ-TV. The Fifth Amendment protects citizens' right against self-incrimination.\n\nHowever, legal analysts who spoke to WBZ-TV agree on one thing. Nothing about this case has been \"normal.\"\n\n\"It's a risk, but I would say, in this case above any other case, you put her on the stand,\" Tracy said.\n\nTracy said he anticipated Read could say things like, \"I don't know if I hit him or not, OK? I don't think I don't think I hit him.\" Or, \"I don't know... Was he already dead when I hit him?\"\n\n\"She could say a lot of those things, which now the jurors [are considering] reasonable doubt,\" Tracy said, adding that putting her on the stand could \"engender sympathy.\"\n\nFormer prosecutor and WBZ-TV legal analyst Jennifer Roman agreed.\n\n\"It's always a gamble for the defense to put the defendant on the stand because anything can happen when somebody goes to testify,\" she said. \"If she does get up there it is going to be one of those hushed courtroom moments.\"\n\nRoman said based on Read's behavior around the media, there's a chance she's willing to testify.\n\n\"[Karen Read] has put herself out in front of the camera now and even as recently as Friday she was speaking to the press about her case,\" Roman said. \"It makes you think that she does want to testify, she does want to tell her story.

In one motion the defense cited this search before writing that McCabe was one of the \"actual perpetrators of this crime.\"\n\nPolice have not charged McCabe with a crime and she has never been declared a suspect or person of interest in the case. McCabe did not respond to Inside Edition Digital's requests for comment.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, McCabe got some support for her claim when Ian Whiffin, digital forensics expert for Cellebrite, took the stand.\n\nIn testimony that streamed on CourtTV, Whiffin said that the timestamp on the search was wrong before explaining to jurors that if a Safari window is minimized and then used again hours later, the old timestamp could be attached to the search. In this case, he said McCabe had been looking at sports scores on her phone and then failed to close the Safari app, which is why her next search appeared to be done at 2:27 a.m. and not after 6 a.m.\n\n\"That's not the time in my opinion that the search was conducted,\" testified Whiffin. He also said that he found no evidence that \"tampering occurred\" on McCabe's cell phone as it related to her Internet usage and search history.\n\nMcCabe was a close friend of O'Keefe's and one of the prosecution's star witnesses.\n\nShe testified in the case last month, saying she saw a black SUV, which looked similar to Read's vehicle, arrive at the home of Brian Albert in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, 2022.\n\nMcCabe also testified about and provided investigators with her text messages from that morning, which show that she texted O'Keefe \"Hello\" from her cell phone and then told him where to park his vehicle. She said on the stand that she then watched as the SUV moved from its initial spot on the street to the left side of the property, where O'Keefe's body was subsequently discovered later that morning.\n\nO'Keefe never entered the residence, McCabe testified. She said that approximately 15 minutes after arriving, the SUV drove off. Four hours later, McCabe said she received a call from O'Keefe's niece looking for her uncle, who assumed guardianship of his niece and nephew after the death of their parents.\n\nO'Keefe's niece said in an interview with a child advocate that she called McCabe at the behest of Read, who allegedly woke her up in the middle of the night while \"screaming and acting frantic,\" according to the statement.\n\nIn her interview with Norfolk Advocates for Children, the niece \"indicated ... that the defendant changed her story several times while speaking to Ms. McCabe on the phone, with initially the defendant stating that she and the victim got into an argument and she dropped him off,\" said the statement.\n\nRead and McCabe then met and with another friend, Kerry Roberts, went looking for O'Keefe.\n\nMcCabe testified that while driving that morning, Read repeatedly said, \"Could I have hit him\" and \"Did I hit him\" while also speaking about a broken tail light on her car. Roberts testified that Read called her that morning and said: \"John's dead. Kerry, Kerry, I wonder if he's dead. It's snowing, he got hit by a plow.\"\n\nMcCabe and Roberts both testified that they arrived at the home of Brian Albert as a brutal snowstorm raged, with the combination of wind and snow limiting visibility. Both women testified that despite these conditions, Read almost immediately announced that she had spotted O'Keefe's body when they arrived at the Albert property.\n\nO'Keefe's body was covered in six inches of snow, first responders and officers testified during the trial.\n\nThose emergency responders attempted to revive O'Keefe after arriving on the scene, taking over from Read. He was eventually transported to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly after 7 a.m., according to witness testimony.\n\nAt least three people on the scene that morning, in addition to McCabe and Roberts, testified that Read brought up the possibility that she had hit O'Keefe with her car.\n\nRead, an equity analyst and college professor at Bentley University, is charged in Norfolk County Superior Court with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol and leaving the scene of personal injury and death.\n\nShe has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintained her innocence ever since the day a grand jury first indicted her on these charges.", "source": {"uri": "insideedition.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Edition"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Timestamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellebrite", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cellebrite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_forensics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital forensics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Edition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inside Edition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Person of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bentley University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superior court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading Groups", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2024-06/karen_read.png?crop=1280:720&width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658667", "eventUri": "eng-9658667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

(WHDH) - The judge in the Karen Read murder trial will rule Thursday if three of the defense's expert witnesses will be able to testify.\n\nThose witnesses, a retired pathologist who also treated patients for animal bites and two accident reconstruction experts, were in court on Tuesday for Judge Beverly Cannone to evaluate whether it was appropriate for them to take the stand in front of the jury.\n\nSpeaking with reporters, defense attorney Alan Jackson said it seemed, to him, that the court was trying to help Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally with his strategy.\n\n\"Judge Cannone is kind of tossing softballs out to Mr. Lally to see if he can hit them out of the park,\" he said. \"I don't even get that. I don't understand it. It doesn't make any sense to me.\"\n\nRead herself spoke with reporters earlier in the week, expressing confidence in how the trial was progressing, but said she could not say for certain if she herself would testify yet.\n\n\"How do I feel about the case against me?\" she told reporters. \"There is no case against me. It's smoke and mirrors and it's going through my private life and trying to contrive a motive that was never there.\"\n\nThough the defense is not likely to put Read on the witness stand, she said she is willing.\n\n\"I would like to fill in some holes and correct some lies,\" she said. \"But it's up to the attorneys and they will make the call probably at the 11th hour and I'm there or not there.\"\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is facing charges including second degree murder after prosecutors said she hit her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, a Boston police officer, with her SUV and left him to die after dropping him off outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert on Jan. 29, 2022.\n\nRead's defense has said she is being framed, saying O'Keefe was actually beaten to death and attacked by a dog during a party inside the Albert home.\n\nRead's attorneys claim police covered up details and planted evidence to implicate Read in the case. The defense has pointed to Proctor as a key player in the alleged cover-up and raised questions about his handling of evidence.\n\nProsecutors have pushed back on the defense's claims.\n\nProceedings will be streaming live on whdh.com, the 7News app, and the 7News Facebook page.\n\nCatch up on the trial with 7News's daily recaps: Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 5, Day 6, Day 7, Day 8, Day 9, Day 10, Day 11, Day 12, Day 13, Day 14, Day 15, Day 16, Day 17, Day 18, Day 19, Day 20, Day 21, Day 22, Day 23, Day 24, Day 25, Day 26.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

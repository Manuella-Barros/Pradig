We know how dominant he has been in previous World Cups. A bad patch, it can happen to anybody. But the good thing about it. He is in the final, and sometimes big players can be called upon and step up and win the actual game for the team as well. So you cannot write off a player like Virat Kohli without a doubt. We know how special he is, so we just have to wait and see what he delivers tomorrow,\" Gayle said during a media conference, according to ANI.\u2014 T20WorldCup (@T20WorldCup) Kohli won the Orange Cap at the end of the 2024 Indian Premier League, after amassing an incredible 741 runs at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 154.69, including five half-centuries.However, he has been pursuing the ghosts of his past self in the ongoing T20 World Cup.

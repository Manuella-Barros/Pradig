Three managers involved . . . they are back at work today and we are (left) awaiting the fate of our members,\" Mrs Bodie said.\n\nShe maintained the employees terminated were acting under directives and never carried out a transaction that was not sanctioned, approved, signed-off and finalised by management at BPL.\n\nAccording staff at the company, employees in the department in question are required to, with any transaction, process claims under the guidance of senior personnel. This means that all transactions would have to go through an authorisation process, checked and approved by a manager, further processed by the employees and then finally signed off by that supervising manager.\n\nFurthermore, all cheques used would have had to have been made out to a vendor recognised and sanctioned by BPL, and if any issues are raised, the audit department would step in, it was claimed.\n\nTo this end, Mrs Bodie said the scheme was fostered through blatant mismanagement and errors on the part of general workers and management alike.\n\n\"There were 44 cheques cut fraudulently for 16 different companies,\" she told The Tribune.\n\n\"(They) were instructed and did exactly that. They didn't come up with these transactions and made these arrangements, they were instructed by their bosses,\" she claimed.\n\n\"But today, these employees, now former, are being (brought) out as if they were the minds and muscle behind this well-thought out scheme,\" the union representative said.\n\n\"This is wrong. This is awful. There is no way this should happen like this. No, the union isn't condoning theft in any way, our point is don't railroad the employees in a scheme created and carried out by persons in management and give the impression that only they were a part of it.\"\n\nYesterday, Ms Osbourne called on union officials to exercise patience as the investigation continues.\n\n\"The public should know that this investigation is not completed as yet,\" she said in a statement sent to The Tribune.\n\n\"Over the ensuing weeks based on the evidence there will be further terminations as management properly considers the evidence gathered.\n\n\"Persons terminated today are not the only ones involved in the scheme. Any individuals who may be higher up in the organisation and found to be culpable will also be terminated.\n\n\"The employees' union should have confidence in management and the board that everyone who actively conspired to defraud BPL will be terminated, irrespective of who they are,\" the chairwoman said.\n\n\"The union should be encouraged to exercise patience and await the full implementation of the investigative report.\"\n\nAftermath\n\nIn a tearful interview Wednesday, one of the terminated employees who agreed to speak with The Tribune if kept anonymous, said she was left devastated by the ordeal.\n\nThe employee said she couldn't put into words how she could be \"used\" and \"thrown to the side\" after more than five years with the company, for doing things she \"did every day.\"\n\n\"This is something I can't explain or even put into words because it's still hard for me to understand. School is opening in a couple of weeks and I am out of a job because, according to this letter, there is suspicion that I was involved in (a) fraudulent scheme.\"\n\nWith tears in her eyes she added: \"I did what I was told; nothing new, nothing strange. The same thing I did every day; I was here. I checked off what I need to check off and I followed all the guidelines as presented to me on day one. Now today, I am being pushed out with my name tied to theft and fraud.\n\n\"One cheque. I was tied to one cheque that I saw no issues with. I was told put together the invoice left on the desk of a temporary employee and put it in for vetting. I did that,\" she told this newspaper.\n\n\"Now I am left to deal with this. I am a single mother. I have to get my kids ready for school. I have so much to do and now this. There is no way to put how I feel into words,\" she said.\n\nPolice in May announced that an investigation was launched into the alleged theft of a large amount of money at BPL.\n\nIn the months since, the scope of the scheme has been uncovered to be larger and costlier than initially suspected.\n\nOfficials have said it is likely people will be prosecuted in relation to the investigation.\n\nWhen contacted this week for comment on audit report's findings, Works Minister Desmond Bannister promised that the government will be \"fully transparent\" with the information presented once it is reviewed.\n\nIn May, BEWU President Paul Maynard contended \"there will be hell to pay,\" if his union members remained on suspension while managers at the power company \"go unscathed\".\n\nAt the time, he insisted employees were being accused of sending in invoices from fake companies, getting a cheque for the amount and then using someone in a local bank to cash the cheques.\n\nMr Maynard added then that the scheme was \"elaborate\" and could not work if only junior staff were involved.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100, "id": 63, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Human_Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 67, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Human Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 445, "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages", "wgt": 100, "id": 610, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "type": "loc", "id": "31"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303465", "label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303547", "label": {"eng": "Money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303561", "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303666", "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment#Employee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305383", "label": {"eng": "Employee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305486", "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307987", "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_&_Young", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "308604", "label": {"eng": "Ernst & Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "312586", "label": {"eng": "Cheque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Below_Poverty_Line_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "390335", "label": {"eng": "Below Poverty Line (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tribune_(Chandigarh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1274184", "label": {"eng": "The Tribune (Chandigarh)"}}]}

If you got an A in school, your parents would take you for ice cream, a happy meal, or some other treat to reinforce how well you were doing. Similarly, we also knew if we did poorly in our studies, our best bet was to pretend to be invisible and work our hardest to get our grades up.\n\nIt can simply be summed up that children do not learn when they are rewarded for sub-par behaviour. In fact, negatively reinforcing a child's poor behaviour does just the opposite. It can foster an attitude of entitlement in that child, preventing them from ever reaching their maximum potential.\n\nTo that end, it is quite alarming for the nation's power company, Bahamas Power & Light (BPL), to receive a $1.1m bonus based on, above all things, its performance. This has certainly not sat well with many households across the country who have had to endure some extremely difficult days when the power goes off and stays off for hours. Families that have had their lives disrupted and inconvenienced who still have to cough up hundreds of dollars for poor service on their power bill find it very hard to believe that such service is rewarded with $1 million big ones.\n\nBahamas Power & Light CEO Pamela Hill pledged that the embattled utility provider aims to achieve two key things:\n\n\"One of them is to improve the efficiency of our plants so they are able to burn less diesel and less heavy fuel oil. You do that by going in early, doing the preventative maintenance, looking at everything associated with the plant and essentially getting more miles per gallon.\"\n\nShe continued, \"We are looking out for our customers and looking to find a product where we can have less ups and downs so that 10 per cent, maybe 20 per cent or 50 per cent of their fuel price is stable or fixed.\"\n\nWe may have heard it all when it comes to over-the-top public relations when it comes to BPL. In fact, BPL is a number of things. Among them, words like \"efficient\" and \"inexpensive\" or \"affordable\" do not come to mind. In a country where we experience such a limited quality of life, it is a slap in the face of all consumers to consistently receive underrated service and have promises made to them ad nauseam, claiming that the sun will shine again tomorrow.\n\nWe demand better than that, and we certainly don't agree to paying an extra $1.1m in bonuses for it. Ms Hill insists that the bonus is justified, as she claims there have been some improvements in service reliability. She also seems to be requesting that frustrated citizens remain patient, stating that \"nothing can be resolved in a very overnight fashion\".\n\nHowever, the continued discontent we're experiencing with our utility provider did not just begin yesterday. Moreover, when PowerSecure was initially brought in to manage the power company it had a specific mandate. The particulars were quite clear - to bring energy reform to The Bahamas, reduce the costs of electricity and improve customer service and reliability. Further, the aforementioned key performance indicators (KPIs) detailed the specific criteria for which BPL would be able to obtain any if not all of the additional $3m performance based compensation.\n\nWhile the nation is in a well-warranted uproar over this issue, the question is now - what exactly were those performance goals that led the former government to practically give away $1.1m from the public purse?\n\nWhat's worse is BPL's CEO - God bless her heart - actually believes the bonus is justified.\n\nImagine you're paying for your leaky roof to be repaired and after a year of renovations, your property manager goes ahead without consulting you and pays full price, and a bonus for the service, all while your roof is still leaking. It's extremely doubtful that property manager and contractor would be able to get a referral from you, much less a bonus.\n\nBPL is an abject failure. The cost hasn't gone down for consumers who already live in a country of approximately 400,000 people that brandishes the title of being the seventh most expensive place to live in the world, per MoveHub.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Peter Turnquest, who also cosigned this study earlier this year, expressed his own contempt with the performance bonus issued by the previous government last month. He admitted that there is not much that the government can do in this regard, as all terms were agreed upon by its predecessor. However, he acknowledged that some in-house conversations will have to take place within government, as I am sure he knows that the public will be expecting the government to protect the interest of the people, and not BPL.\n\nEnergy reform was a campaign promise of the Minnis administration, and certainly is a crucial part of its mandate to the people. BPL also indicated as much, but we have yet to see the business plan to gain an understanding of where decreased costs and more reliable service stand in their timeline. How are we expected to be patient, and for how much longer?\n\nTragically, we cannot afford the luxury of buying dreams of old adages about the sun coming out again tomorrow. Rather, we are quite confident that it will. We can feel its intensity as we endure the sweltering heat and pray 1.1 million 'Hail Mary's' for our appliances to still be in working order whenever the power is restored.\n\nAs we are entering the most active time of this dreaded hurricane season, flashbacks of the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew are enough to give a person with the most stable hands PTSD. Many are fearful of reliving that nightmare and having it topped off with extended power outages being met by high light bills\n\nUndoubtedly, we will be asked again to have more patience and trust in a power provider that has been nothing short of a gigantic disappointment.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "type": "loc", "id": "31"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302736", "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302743", "label": {"eng": "Fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303023", "label": {"eng": "Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303165", "label": {"eng": "Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303169", "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303222", "label": {"eng": "Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303435", "label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303760", "label": {"eng": "Ice cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304158", "label": {"eng": "Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304487", "label": {"eng": "Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305536", "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306352", "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307661", "label": {"eng": "Customer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307870", "label": {"eng": "Fuel economy in automobiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308000", "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308606", "label": {"eng": "Consultant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309047", "label": {"eng": "Patient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_promise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314632", "label": {"eng": "Election promise"}}]}

However, all managers suspended were allowed to return to work Tuesday.\n\nBahamas Electrical Workers Union Secretary General Astrid Bodie, in an interview with The Tribune outside of the company's Blue Hill Road headquarters Wednesday, demanded clarification on the process that had led to the firings.\n\nShe took issue with treatment of junior employees, as compared to the managers implicated in the scheme.\n\nWhen contacted Thursday, she contended if rumours were correct, the managers expected to be terminated today are not the ones implicated, rather managers caught in other alleged egregious acts discovered as a result of the probe into more than $2m defrauded from BPL.\n\nBPL Chairwoman Darnell Osbourne has maintained that more firings are on the way as the investigation continues and will include those who are \"higher up\" in the company if found culpable.\n\nIn a statement that came hours after the initial firings, Ms Osbourne said the company takes the matter surrounding the missing funds very seriously and intends to \"go through the necessary channels\" to reclaim all money lost, adding that BPL will \"follow up\" with police to \"ensure justice and guard against similar actions in the future.\"\n\nWhen contacted by The Tribune on Thursday on the latest developments, Ms Osbourne offered no comment.\n\nIn May police announced that an investigation was launched into the alleged theft of a large amount of money at BPL.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages", "wgt": 100, "id": 610, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "type": "loc", "id": "31"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303666", "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305536", "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_&_Young", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "308604", "label": {"eng": "Ernst & Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bahamas_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "374338", "label": {"eng": "Royal Bahamas Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tribune_(Chandigarh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1274184", "label": {"eng": "The Tribune (Chandigarh)"}}]}

And now I have it I'm so happy.\"\n\nBoxer Cindy Ngamba has already assured the Refugee Olympic Team of its first ever medal, but Lobalu could upgrade her guaranteed bronze.\n\nThe first round of the 5,000m begins on Wednesday, but it has been a long journey for Lobalu to reach the start line.\n\nIt is one that began in Sudan and has taken detours via Kenya and Switzerland.\n\nFleeing South Sudan\n\nIn 1998, Lobalu was born into a country in the middle of a long-running civil war.\n\nHe grew up in Chukudum, a small village in south-east Sudan which would become part of South Sudan when it gained independence in 2011.\n\nThe conflict, which ended in 2005, is estimated to have killed two million people.\n\nBut two years after the war Lobalu's home village was raided by soldiers. The family fled but he was separated from his parents.\n\nHe wound up in an orphanage and then, at the age of nine, made it across the border to Kenya with the help of an Italian NGO.\n\nThe Kakuma Refugee Camp, a sprawling settlement in north-west Kenya run by the UNHCR, became his new home.\n\nNow living in Switzerland, Lobalu is reluctant to talk in depth about his past before a competition, preferring to focus on the future.\n\nHowever, he admits his experiences at the camp motivate him on the track.\n\n\"I don't want to go back to that life,\" he said.\n\n\"The life that I [had] there is more painful than the running.\n\n\"Where I came from, you don't know if you're eating tomorrow. You don't have a guarantee that you will get food.\"\n\nLobalu's two older sisters still live in Kakuma, and he dreams of one day helping them leave.\n\n\"They are fighting a lot in Kakuma so they don't sleep enough,\" he said.\n\n\"They're scared at night. Sometimes they go to the hospital, they sleep there because they are scared.\"\n\nThe start of an Olympic dream\n\nLobalu's Olympic dream began in 2012 when he watched Mo Farah win 10,000m gold at the London Games.\n\nHowever, it was not necessarily Farah's performance that inspired him.\n\n\"The way they were running, it looked too slow on the TV,\" he said.\n\n\"[I] was like, 'Wow, if I could have been [there] I could've won.'\"\n\nIn 2015, Lobalu competed barefoot in a 10km race at the Kakuma camp which was organised by famed Kenyan runner Tegla Loroupe.\n\nThe teenager finished second and Loroupe, a two-time winner of the New York Marathon, invited Lobalu to join a training camp at her foundation on the outskirts of Nairobi.\n\nTwo years later, just shy of his 19th birthday, Lobalu competed in the heats of the 1500m at the 2017 World Championships in London - in the same stadium where Farah won Olympic gold five years earlier.\n\nFeaturing at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics appeared to be an attainable goal, until his time with the Athlete Refugee Team came to an abrupt end.\n\nSeeking Swiss asylum\n\nIn 2019, Lobalu travelled to Geneva to compete in a 10km race.\n\nAfter his victory he snuck out of the team's hotel and decided he would stay in Switzerland, no matter the consequences.\n\nPenniless, he applied for asylum at a Swiss refugee centre where an immigration officer connected him with coach Markus Hagmann, who consequently invited him to train in St Gallen.\n\nLobalu won the first race in Switzerland Hagmann could find, and he continued winning.\n\nBut that would not be enough to compete in Japan.\n\nIn July 2021, in the lead up to the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games, the IOC and the United Nations Human Rights Council ruled that Lobalu could not represent the Refugee Olympic Team.\n\nBut in June the following year Lobalu was granted a short-term residency permit in Switzerland, allowing him to travel outside of the country and compete.\n\nAt the end of that month, guided by coach Hagmann, Lobalu had a breakthrough performance at his first ever Diamond League meeting - beating half marathon world champion Jacob Kiplimo to win the 3000m in Stockholm.\n\nLobalu is not eligible to apply for Swiss citizenship until 2031, but in September last year World Athletics granted him permission to race for his adopted country from April 2026.\n\nThat date was subsequently brought forward to May this year, allowing him to appear at the European Championships in Rome and become the first refugee to win a medal at a major international event.\n\n\"It feels amazing,\" Lobalu said.\n\n\"When I was young, I didn't know that I can have something like this. But after two medals I think it's just the beginning.\"\n\nRefugee Team recall\n\nYet, six weeks before the Paris Games, the IOC declined to allow Lobalu to compete for Switzerland.\n\n\"He is not currently a Swiss national, which the Olympic Charter would require,\" an IOC statement said.\n\nHowever, the day after Lobalu became European champion, the IOC invited him to compete in the 5,000m in the French capital for the Refugee Olympic Team.\n\nA long-time admirer of Olympic athletics, Lobalu believes Wednesday's heat at the Stade de France will be more difficult than the final.\n\n\"For the heat we have the slowest guys,\" he explained.\n\n\"They have never had international races, so it's easier for you to fall down because they don't follow the line.\n\n\"If you try to approach them, if you want to move out, they don't allow you so they just block.\"\n\nOn Thursday, two days before the men's 5,000m final, Swiss sportswear brand On will release a short film documenting Lobalu's journey entitled 'To Chase a Dream'.\n\n\"I enjoyed participating in the production and I hope it inspires other refugee athletes to never give up on their dreams of becoming the best.\"\n\nAnd he already has his sights on the next chapter - standing on top of the podium with a gold medal in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"},

Sometimes they go to the hospital, they sleep there because they are scared.\"\n\nLobalu's Olympic dream began in 2012 when he watched Mo Farah win 10,000m gold at the London Games.\n\nHowever, it was not necessarily Farah's performance that inspired him.\n\n\"The way they were running, it looked too slow on the TV,\" he said.\n\n\"[I] was like, 'Wow, if I could have been [there] I could've won.'\"\n\nIn 2015, Lobalu competed barefoot in a 10km race at the Kakuma camp which was organised by famed Kenyan runner Tegla Loroupe.\n\nThe teenager finished second and Loroupe, a two-time winner of the New York Marathon, invited Lobalu to join a training camp at her foundation on the outskirts of Nairobi.\n\nTwo years later, just shy of his 19th birthday, Lobalu competed in the heats of the 1500m at the 2017 World Championships in London - in the same stadium where Farah won Olympic gold five years earlier.\n\nFeaturing at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics appeared to be an attainable goal, until his time with the Athlete Refugee Team came to an abrupt end.\n\nIn 2019, Lobalu travelled to Geneva to compete in a 10km race.\n\nAfter his victory he snuck out of the team's hotel and decided he would stay in Switzerland, no matter the consequences.\n\nPenniless, he applied for asylum at a Swiss refugee centre where an immigration officer connected him with coach Markus Hagmann, who consequently invited him to train in St Gallen.\n\nLobalu won the first race in Switzerland Hagmann could find, and he continued winning.\n\nBut that would not be enough to compete in Japan.\n\nIn July 2021, in the lead up to the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games, the IOC and the United Nations Human Rights Council ruled that Lobalu could not represent the Refugee Olympic Team.\n\nBut in June the following year Lobalu was granted a short-term residency permit in Switzerland, allowing him to travel outside of the country and compete.\n\nAt the end of that month, guided by coach Hagmann, Lobalu had a breakthrough performance at his first ever Diamond League meeting - beating half marathon world champion Jacob Kiplimo to win the 3000m in Stockholm.\n\nLobalu is not eligible to apply for Swiss citizenship until 2031, but in September last year World Athletics granted him permission to race for his adopted country from April 2026.\n\nThat date was subsequently brought forward to May this year, allowing him to appear at the European Championships in Rome and become the first refugee to win a medal at a major international event.\n\n\"It feels amazing,\" Lobalu said.\n\n\"When I was young, I didn't know that I can have something like this. But after two medals I think it's just the beginning.\"\n\nYet, six weeks before the Paris Games, the IOC declined to allow Lobalu to compete for Switzerland.\n\n\"He is not currently a Swiss national, which the Olympic Charter would require,\" an IOC statement said.\n\nHowever, the day after Lobalu became European champion, the IOC invited him to compete in the 5,000m in the French capital for the Refugee Olympic Team.\n\nA long-time admirer of Olympic athletics, Lobalu believes Wednesday's heat at the Stade de France will be more difficult than the final.\n\n\"For the heat we have the slowest guys,\" he explained.\n\n\"They have never had international races, so it's easier for you to fall down because they don't follow the line.\n\n\"If you try to approach them, if you want to move out, they don't allow you so they just block.\"\n\nOn Thursday, two days before the men's 5,000m final, Swiss sportswear brand On will release a short film documenting Lobalu's journey entitled 'To Chase a Dream'.\n\n\"I enjoyed participating in the production and I hope it inspires other refugee athletes to never give up on their dreams of becoming the best.\"\n\nAnd he already has his sights on the next chapter - standing on top of the podium with a gold medal in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [],

And now I have it. I'm so happy.\"\n\nBoxer Cindy Ngamba has already assured the Refugee Olympic Team of its first-ever medal, but Lobalu could upgrade her guaranteed bronze.\n\nThe first round of the 5,000m begins on Wednesday, but it has been a long journey for Lobalu to reach the start line.\n\nIt is one that began in Sudan and has taken detours via Kenya and Switzerland.\n\nFleeing South Sudan:\n\nIn 1998, Lobalu was born into a country in the middle of a long-running civil war.\n\nHe grew up in Chukudum, a small village in south-east Sudan which would become part of South Sudan when it gained independence in 2011.\n\nThe conflict, which ended in 2005, is estimated to have killed two million people.\n\nBut two years after the war, Lobalu's home village was raided by soldiers. The family fled, but he was separated from his parents.\n\nHe wound up in an orphanage and then, at the age of nine, made it across the border to Kenya with the help of an Italian NGO.\n\nThe Kakuma Refugee Camp, a sprawling settlement in northwest Kenya run by the UNHCR, became his new home.\n\nNow living in Switzerland, Lobalu is reluctant to talk in-depth about his past before a competition, preferring to focus on the future.\n\nHowever, he admits that his experiences at the camp motivate him to stay on track.\n\n\"I don't want to go back to that life,\" he said.\n\n\"The life that I had there is more painful than the running.\n\n\"Where I came from, you don't know if you're eating tomorrow. You don't have a guarantee that you will get food.\"\n\nLobalu's two older sisters still live in Kakuma, and he dreams of one day helping them leave.\n\n\"They are fighting a lot in Kakuma, so they don't sleep enough,\" he said.\n\n\"They're scared at night.

There's Just One Problem: He Has No Country to Run For.", "body": "Dominic Lobalu is one of the best runners on the planet, but his chance to make history in Paris almost didn't happen.\n\nBefore you turn nine years old, your life is split in two. In the first part, you are happy. Your parents are farmers, and you live with them and your sisters in Chukudum, a small village in the green Equatoria region of what is now South Sudan, not far from the border with Uganda. You play with your friends in the green.\n\nIn the second part, you are separated from your family after your home is attacked. It is 2007, and civilians are caught in violent clashes between government forces from the north and rebels from the south, and also among the various rebel groups. A peace deal two years earlier that was supposed to end the two-decade civil war between northern and southern Sudan is falling apart.\n\nYou jump onto a big truck with other boys who have suddenly become orphans. It brings you to a refugee camp in Kenya called Kakuma, a place you've heard about that is full of thousands of refugees and is so big it could be a city. Conditions are bleak: crowded, dilapidated housing; little clean water; malaria and cholera outbreaks; and high temperatures. You cry, desperately, and want to go home.\n\nYou get a scholarship to study in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, but after you finish primary school, you can no longer afford the fees. You live in an orphanage, and realize that no one really cares about what happens to you. You start working at a market unloading trucks of cabbage, watermelons, bananas, and tomatoes for a few dollars a day.\n\nWhen you go back to school to offer the little money you've earned at the market, you are asked if you are joking and told not to return. But you can run fast, and you eventually gain admission to a school on a track scholarship. You reconnect with one of your sisters but have no idea what happened to the rest of them and try not to think about it.\n\nNot long after that, you are scouted by a representative of something called the Athlete Refugee Team, an initiative started around 2015 by World Athletics (the governing body for track and field), the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Founded to give athletes who are refugees a chance to compete internationally despite not having a country to run for, the team's headquarters is the Tegla Loroupe Sports Training Center, set up by the legendary Kenyan runner in the hills just outside Nairobi. This could be your chance to become the first refugee to win a medal at the Olympics. You say yes.\n\nOn a Sunday in May 2019, after two years on the team, you have just won your first international competition, the Harmony Geneva Marathon for UNICEF 10K road race in Geneva, Switzerland. It's the first time in your running career that you don't feel like a beginner, that you have enough experience to start winning.\n\nLater that night you get ready for bed because you have a long journey ahead: The flight back to Nairobi; the drive back to the training camp in the little town of Ngong; the walk back to your quarters in the camp, a spare, clean room with a blanket-covered bed and a chair, and a window looking onto the grassy courtyard. But you begin to think about a different future.\n\nYour name is Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu. You make a decision.\n\nAs a boy in Kenya, Dominic Lobalu excelled in history class, but the part of school he most enjoyed was physical education. \"I liked to play,\" he recalls, laughing. He wanted to travel the world, and thought being a journalist \"would be the easiest way\" to do that. Outside of class, he loved listening to reggae and dancehall music. A teacher in primary school was the first person to tell him he was a good runner, but he was more interested in soccer. Lobalu spent time at an open field in Nairobi where a lot of South Sudanese boys played, and where private schools sometimes scouted kids for athletic scholarships. He didn't get picked for a soccer scholarship, but he asked to be considered for a running one. The scout told him he didn't look like a runner, but later decided to give him a chance. Lobalu ran to school every morning, trained, and started winning cross-country races. It was 2015, and Lobalu was discovering he could have a future in the sport if he wanted it.\n\nWhen he finally reunited with one of his sisters at the Kakuma Refugee Camp, it had been about nine years since he last saw her. They'd had no photos, no letters since then. They didn't recognize each other. \"We passed each other on the road,\" he says. His sister cried when they embraced. She now has children, but still lives in Kakuma.\n\nBy the time he was scouted for the refugee team at a competition in Kenya, he was beginning to understand the value of pursuing a running career. It was 2017, and he had been fortunate he \"didn't stay for long\" at Kakuma before winning his first scholarship to attend school in Nairobi. His earnings would help support his sisters. \"Running can make you healthy; it can bring food on the table; and I have a lot of people who need help where I came from,\" he says. He knew so many at his old orphanage who had potential but no support or opportunities.\n\nThe Athlete Refugee Team debuted at the 2016 Rio Olympics as part of the larger IOC Refugee Olympic Team; members have competed at nearly every World Athletics Championships since then, along with the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the Paris Olympics this summer. Five of the athletes in Rio were runners from South Sudan who had lived in Kakuma. The IOC and World Athletics have since helped provide skills training and educational scholarships to refugee athletes as part of the program. \"It's about trying to help them find their place in the world and feel like they can belong,\" says Jackie Brock-Doyle, director of special projects for World Athletics.\n\nOn that Sunday in Geneva in 2019, Lobalu was celebrating with his teammates before they returned to Nairobi the next day. The team had competed in two races that weekend. \"It was my first time on the podium,\" says Lobalu, who is now 25. The men were marking the moment with hamburgers and pizza.\n\nBut as the celebrations wound down, Lobalu began to think about not going back to Kenya. \"If you are independent and live on your own, then it's a good place. But the problem now is if you are under someone, then it's a different story,\" he told me. He felt as if his time and living conditions had been controlled at the camp. By the time team staff checked his hotel room when he didn't show up for breakfast, Lobalu was gone.\n\nLate one afternoon last July, I met Lobalu and his coach, 8-time Swiss national 3,000 meters steeplechase champion Markus Hagmann, in the courtyard bar of a hotel in St. Gallen in northeastern Switzerland. Lobalu was stretched out on a chair sipping a Rivella, a Swiss soft drink made with milk. he is slight, with richly dark skin and a boyish face. Hagmann, who is trim, lightly bearded, and cautiously friendly, has become his friend and self-appointed protector, especially when it comes to journalists asking Lobalu about his past. I interrupted the pair as Hagmann was teasing Lobalu about his lack of driving skills; Lobalu was taking lessons.\n\nIn 2019, when Lobalu had fled the Geneva hotel room, he had no idea where he was headed. \"I took the train, walking all over Geneva,\" he recalls. The odyssey was just beginning. He ended up at a Red Cross office, where he got information about how to apply for asylum. He would have to make his way to a center in Lausanne, one hour away by train. Upon arriving in Lausanne, he learned he had to go to a different center, another several hours away, for refugees who had not been fingerprinted in another European country before coming to Switzerland.\n\nDuring the months his asylum application was under review, Lobalu waited in the refugee center in southern Switzerland. It was his second time in a refugee camp wondering what would happen to him. After the Swiss government granted him a short-term work permit, the center connected him with Hagmann so he could continue running.\n\nHagmann, a secondary school teacher, wasn't even coaching full-time, but he was intrigued. He wanted to see how far they could go.\n\nWhen we spoke in St. Gallen, Lobalu declined to comment on why he left the refugee team, citing a desire to focus on the future rather than the past, and was careful to praise Tegla Loroupe for her kindness and support.\n\nBut Lobalu is not the only athlete who has left the team. Several others have left over the years citing various degrees of dissatisfaction with treatment and compensation. Gatkuoth Puok Thiep is a fellow South Sudanese refugee who fled at the same time as Lobalu in Geneva, and he described an atmosphere of constant uncertainty at the training center.\n\nThese athletes expressed frustration with the monthly stipend they received from the training center run by Loroupe, which was funded by World Athletics, the IOC, and the UNHCR. The experience \"was life-changing for a lot of people,\" says Gai John Nyang, another refugee from South Sudan who left the team in 2017 while they were traveling through Germany. But he found the monthly payment -- 5,000 Kenyan shillings (around 40 U.S. dollars today) -- impossible to live on.\n\n\"Many things didn't work well,\" says Volker Wagner, who coached the team in 2016. \"There was a problem with money, there was a problem with food, there was a problem with everything. Tegla was listening to the wrong people. You have to survive with [$40] per month. You cannot help your family.\"\n\nAnna Legnani was the deputy director of communications for World Athletics from 1994 to 2020. In that role, she was also the liaison between the governing body and the refugee team. \"On the one hand, they're in the news as these feel-good stories,\" Legnani said of the athletes. \"At the same time, their daily life is not making a big difference for them. Their interests as athletes should have come first.\"\n\nOn a cold morning in Nairobi last August, I met Loroupe near the office of her foundation. A petite woman with kind eyes and a high forehead, Loroupe was the first African woman to win the New York City Marathon, which she did in 1994 and 1995. Now 51, she started the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation to help ease conflicts in East African pastoralist regions through efforts such as Peace Races. Growing up in the West Pokot region in the north of the country, a place known for armed disputes over cattle and land, Loroupe had encountered South Sudanese refugees in her hometown. She had wanted to push back against the stereotype that refugees were criminals, a stigma she had faced being from West Pokot, too. \"I saw the talent there,\" she said of visiting the refugee camps. \"I saw in the camp the way they were running.\"\n\nLoroupe disputes the criticisms of life at the training center. \"At the camp, they received everything. Clothes were supported by [the Swiss sportswear company, On Running], medical care,\" she says. \"When the money isn't enough and somebody is sick in their family, they come to me. I was using my own money.\"\n\nEven with opportunities provided by the Athlete Refugee Team, the probability of success for refugees is more complicated -- especially when compared with runners from the Rift Valley in Kenya and neighboring Ethiopia, athletes who have trained in cool, high-altitude environments since they were children. In contrast, South Sudanese refugees, many of whom are orphans, have had to contend with the trauma and instability of surviving a deadly conflict, losing their families, and moving through camps and school -- all during their formative years -- as well as not having a country to call home. It is impossible to become a Kenyan citizen as a refugee, and for all the country's hospitality to over a million displaced people from South Sudan, Somalia, and other places, refugees can find it difficult to make a stable life there.\n\nThere are about 117 million forcibly displaced people in the world, according to the UNHCR. \"For us, the message has always been that refugees are people like you and I. They have the same talent; they just need opportunities,\" says Bernard Rono, assistant external relations officer with UNHCR who works with the refugee athletes in Kenya. \"Our mandate is to make sure refugees continue to receive the protection they deserve,\" he says. \"At the end of the day, we are not a sports agency.\"\n\nAfter Lobalu left the team, Loroupe says she tried to convince him to change his mind, to go to the Kenyan embassy in Geneva and say he had made a mistake. She tried to tell him that being a refugee in Switzerland would be even more difficult than it was in Kenya. Refugees are relegated to a limbo status no matter where they end up outside of the country they left, until they gain citizenship elsewhere. Many never do. \"Time doesn't wait for you,\" Loroupe said, of athletes giving up their relatively privileged positions on the team. As of this publishing, Loroupe no longer manages the camp, and the athletes have moved to other training centers in the Rift Valley.\n\nWhen Lobalu started working with Hagmann, his primary goals were to build endurance and speed. \"Without a better time, I could not get into the good races,\" Lobalu says.\n\nFor Hagmann, the most important focus was Lobalu's mental and physical health. \"He was already running fast. But he was struggling a lot. His body was not ready. When we trained 20, 30 miles, he was already injured,\" Hagmann says. That first year, Lobalu was getting his mind and body back to health and beginning to trust his new coach. \"It took him a long time to understand that someone was helping him without any expectations,\" Hagmann says.\n\nLobalu's style of running is distinctively buoyant and fluid. \"His movements are so soft,\" Hagmann says. \"His body is very slim, and he brings up his heels high when he runs.\" By 2022, Lobalu was getting results. He won the 3,000 meter Diamond League event in Stockholm in 7:29.48, beating Ugandan superstar Jacob Kiplimo.\n\n\"I did not expect him to rise up that fast and win Diamond League,\" Hagmann says, laughing. \"We started with nothing. This is what makes me so proud of him.\" That fall, at the Copenhagen Half, Lobalu ran 59:12. If he'd been allowed to compete for Switzerland, it would have been a new European record. Lobalu was on his way to establishing himself as one of the best middle- and long-distance runners in the world. He should have been planning for the World Championships and the Olympics. But in 2022 he still had no country to run for.\n\nHe wanted the Olympics most of all. Last July, Lobalu was waiting to find out if he would be allowed to represent Switzerland at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest in August. Without that, he would be unable to qualify for the Olympics, and participate in the most elite competitions held by World Athletics. Much of Europe requires residents who want to become citizens to have lived in the country anywhere from five to 10 years. To receive Swiss nationality, Lobalu would have to live there for 10 years.\n\n\"For a running career, this is not an option,\" Hagmann said last summer. \"We are not looking to change countries. If Switzerland would just offer him nationality, he could compete. But this is not the way it works here.\" Through the Swiss Athletics Federation, they petitioned World Athletics for a transfer of allegiance, essentially permission for Lobalu to compete for Switzerland without having citizenship. They say they were not asking for an exception because Lobalu is a talented athlete; they wanted his application to change how other refugee athletes are treated in the future. \"It has to be a fair process for everyone,\" Hagmann said.\n\nAthletes have long transferred their allegiance to other nations to compete for their teams. Many East African runners run for other nations because the competition in their countries is so fierce; even excellent athletes have trouble standing out. The practice has become so common that World Athletics added a rule that athletes must wait three years after transferring allegiance to their new countries before they are eligible to compete for them, and their adopted countries have to show they are giving the athletes full citizenship. This waiting period was meant to cut down on abuse of the practice; during the European Athletics Championships in 2016, the Turkish team included seven Kenyans, one Ethiopian, two Jamaicans, one South African, one Cuban, and several other nationalities. \"It was akin to human trafficking,\" Brock-Doyle, of World Athletics, says. \"People were taking athletes from one country to another, and then when they got injured or weren't competing properly, they then just get thrown back to their countries.\"\n\nAs for Lobalu, \"he is hugely talented .... but if we continue to allow athletes [who defect] to compete as part of the refugee team, we won't have a refugee team,\" Brock-Doyle says. \"Because it is only on goodwill, from both UNHCR and foreign governments, that allows us to do this,\" she says. \"Part of what we discuss with athletes is that we are here to support and give them skills and help them through education and training, and the quid pro quo is that they don't disappear -- and the majority don't. We can't put in jeopardy a program that has helped him and will help so many.\"\n\nWhile they waited for a decision last summer, Lobalu was off the competition circuit, recovering from a leg injury. \"The plan is still the World Champs,\" Hagmann said at the time. \"If we get permission, we have to be ready. If not, the relaunch will be five days later, in Zurich.\" He turned to Lobalu: \"It's your home race.\" There would be more Diamond League races after Zurich, and then the Copenhagen half marathon in September.\n\nWhen we met last summer in St. Gallen, Lobalu was about to resume training in the Swiss Alps town of St. Moritz, where he was planning to stay for several weeks. On a hot July afternoon a few days before he left for St. Moritz, I accompanied him and Hagmann on a visit with a new physical therapist for Lobalu's injury. He had spent the morning running 23 kilometers down a river trail, and then we drove through scenic villages and apple farms to a house close to the placid, blue Lake Constance, and parked. Lobalu was used to pushing through extreme discomfort to keep running, but Hagmann wanted him to stop doing that, and admit when he was in pain. \"He can take a lot of pain before he starts struggling,\" Hagmann said. As they left the house, Lobalu joked to the physical therapist, \"We'll be disturbing you a lot. You don't have free time anymore.\"\n\nAfterward, Lobalu needed to pack for his trip -- several pairs of running shoes, shorts and singlet, and jeans and a button-down shirt \"for looking good\" when he went out, he told me, laughing.\n\nThe World Championships came and went last August. Lobalu still had not gotten news about his petition. On August 31, he placed fifth in the 5,000 meters at the Diamond League event in Zurich with a time of 13:07.02.\n\nThen, in early September, World Athletics announced that Lobalu could transfer allegiance in 2026 and start competing for Switzerland before becoming a Swiss citizen. While it was a positive development, it still meant he would miss significant races until then, including the 2024 Paris Olympics. \"I would prefer to be able to run right away. Athletes dream of competing in world championship and Olympic medals,\" Lobalu said in a statement. Hagmann told me, \"The team was a good idea to help people. But then Dominic shows up and he becomes faster and faster. No one ever thought about this.\"\n\nWhen he and Hagmann started working together, Lobalu had been running the 5K in 14:02 and the 10K in 29:14. On December 31, 2023, he tied the European 5K record with a 13:12 in Spain; two weeks later, again in Spain, he tied the European 10K record with a 27:13. In February, he ran an indoor 3,000 meters personal best of 7:39.32 at the World Athletics meet in France. \"Most people, if you say 'I'm a refugee,' they ...look at you like maybe you're nothing, you cannot do anything,\" Lobalu says. \"I'm trying to prove them wrong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on January 11, 2024, World Athletics clarified their September 2023 decision, stating Lobalu could be eligible to set both Swiss national and European records. Then in May, Swiss Athletics declared he could represent Switzerland at the European Championships in Rome the following month. \"Dominic Lobalu has established a close and lasting link to the country,\" the organization said in a press release, \"and, as a recognized refugee, is under Switzerland's protection. Swiss Athletics assumes that the eligibility to represent Switzerland is also granted for the Paris Olympic Games, provided Dominic Lobalu runs the respective qualifying times.\"\n\nIn Rome on June 12, 2024, Lobalu became the first refugee in history to win gold at a European championship, finishing the 10,000 meter with a time of 28:00. The next day, he received an invitation from the IOC to compete in Paris as part of the Olympic Refugee Team.\n\nA representative from the IOC told me that its executive board \"invited Dominic Lobalu to compete as a member of the Refugee Olympic Team for Paris 2024, as earlier this year he was granted refugee status in Switzerland and has recently achieved the World Athletics standard for participation in the Olympic Games (5,000m).\" It's unclear what the invitation means for Lobalu's relationship with the World Athletics-affiliated Refugee Athlete Team, which he left in 2019.\n\n\"Even though I would have loved to compete for my new home country,\" Lobalu said in a statement after the announcement, \"I'm delighted to have the chance to compete at the Olympic Games. I know where I come from -- and where I belong. In Paris, I will also be running with Switzerland in my heart.\"\n\nOf the athletes who have left the Athlete Refugee Team and are now in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, only Lobalu seems to be realizing his running dreams.\n\nGatkuoth Puok Thiep also lives in Switzerland, along with Lobalu, but no longer competes. He says he is not in the right mental space to run professionally. He now works for a shoe company.\n\nNyang, in Germany, still runs sometimes in his spare time, but it isn't the same without a coach and sponsor and races to compete in, and he knows it never will be again. Becoming a German citizen would take years and be difficult: the ever-evolving requirements include having an advanced proficiency in German. \"The five of us [who, besides Lobalu, left the team], we were the best with a great, bright potential,\" Nyang says. \"But we cannot continue, it's not easy here.\"\n\nThere was a mix of sadness and bitterness in his voice. He now works at a factory that makes plastic cups. He says he refuses to think about what his life and career would have been like if he had stayed in Kenya -- but his life in Germany is not what he had hoped for, either.\n\nYour name is Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu. You made a decision.\n\nNow that you are 25, South Sudan is a fading collection of images and feelings, a place that was once home but turned into a source of terror.\n\nKenya was temporary, a country you grew up in and realized your athletic gifts, but never let you forget you did not belong.\n\nSwitzerland feels right. You feel safe and happy and comfortable. You can speak a decent amount of German. It's not a lot, but you can survive with what you know.\n\nThere aren't that many other Africans around in St. Gallen, much less South Sudanese, but people are generally friendly. They recognize you in town and honk when they see you running on the road; it feels good. You would prefer if the local clubs played reggae instead of techno, but you don't get everything you want.\n\nYou miss Kenya sometimes, especially the food, but you believe it's better that you have space of your own now.\n\nYou admire athletes like Eliud Kipchoge, the world's most-decorated marathoner, and Mo Farah, the retired British distance runner who was born in Somalia and has four Olympic gold medals. You hope that you can achieve some of the same glory. But you've learned how to wait -- you've had to -- so you are patient. You know it's a long game.\n\nYou still have dreams. You want to get married one day, and have a family; to support your people back home; to win a medal at the World Championships or the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "runnersworld.com", "dataType":

Students of change know that while there will always be black swans and shocks from the unknown unknowns, we often see more of what\u2019s coming than we give ourselves credit for. Corporate workplaces are in a particularly rapid state of flux, with more change having happened over the past four years than did after the invention of the internet. And yet I fear we\u2019re only at the inception of a paradigm shift that would make Thomas Kuhn sweat. Future economists and sociologists will have a field day with codifying the results of the innumerable human experiments corporations are engaging in their workplaces. Yogi Berra rightfully noted that it\u2019s difficult to make predictions, especially about the future. However, I believe we have enough evidence to call the race on five nascent trends that will become workplace staples over the next decades. Ordered by their potential for disrupting the corporate status quo, the five corporate trends that are past their tipping point are: AI-nativeness Fully remote workforces Four-day work weeks Offering Nordic-style parental leaves; and Emphasizing impact over performance management MORE FOR YOU Why Christina Ricci Is Giving Up Ownership Of Wednesday Addams WWE SmackDown Results, Winners And Grades On June 7, 2024 Howard University Returning Sean Diddy Combs 1 Million Donation Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations Join us below in a corporate strategist\u2019s equivalent of time travel as we examine each trend and how a handful of companies have already taken steps to implement tomorrow\u2019s workplaces today. AI-Native Everything It\u2019s jolting to think that just a few years ago, the world was abuzz with versions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution where self-driving cars, the Internet of Things and 3-D printing seemed more immediate drivers of corporate change than AI. It\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t know AI was coming; we\u2019ve had a lively discourse on it for decades with past luminaries such as Richard Feynman having had their opportunities to weigh in. It\u2019s just that no one could have anticipated that Sam Altman and his crew would bring it all to our doorsteps already on November 30, 2022. The proverbial genie is not only out of the bottle, it's well on its way past the furthest layers of our atmosphere on a direct trajectory to outer space. As we continue to address the most immediate consequences of the AI-boom, we can also safely predict one near-term stable equilibrium. Knowing what we know about how deeply and quickly have adjusted to pre-AI digital transformations such as the dot.com and e-Commerce booms, it\u2019s clear that the future corporation will be AI-native across every industry. Sure, software has an early leg up on all the rest, but that won\u2019t stop more conservative industries like HR following suit. In fact, companies like Borderless AI are busily doing to traditional HR what ChatGPT has done to software engineering. \u201cTaking an existing fundamental business problem, like HR, and making current solutions even more efficient by AI, will be the predominant business model for start-ups and runaway successes in the coming years,\u201d Wilson Cross, CEO of Borderless AI, reflected during our conversation on how AI will be implemented across the corporate landscape. Think of AI-nativeness this way: there\u2019s no company worth taking seriously in any vertical or horizontal slice of the market that isn\u2019t digital where it counts. Even plumbing technicians that are past their corporate mandated retirement ages answer emails and send quotes through Angi. Very soon, and much sooner than you think, the same will be true about AI. Every company, in every industry, niche and corporate crevice imaginable, will be using AI. Whether it's implementing AI agents, open-access GPTs or in-house language models, getting on board with AI-nativeness will soon be nothing but table stakes. It comes as no surprise that the current forerunners in AI-nativeness are the very companies ushering in this paradigm shift, with OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity AI and an innumerable number of AI-startups leading the charge. Fully Remote Workforces Will No Longer Be The Exception While it might not seem like it today, the end of return-to-office mandates (RTO) is close. For places like New York, we even have a reasonable estimate of the exact timing when CEOs will begin to lose their interest forcing butts in seats, largely thanks to expiring leases untying the hands of their CFOs. One of the most counterintuitive results of the natural experiment that was COVID-19 was that it seems working from home is neither significantly less, or more, productive than working from the office, as long as the right technologies for communication and coordination are in place. When we combine the two premises above, we get a future where only those companies that obtain a competitive advantage from working from the office will continue to do so. Competitive pressures and employee preferences will make sure of it. If you are keen to experience a glimpse of this particular vision of the future yourself, you should consider applying to companies like GitLab and Shopify. Shopify\u2019s Careers landing page gives a good idea of what to expect from a growing share of the corporate landscape: \u201cif you prefer a prescriptive corporate structure and an in-person office environment, that\u2019s not us.\u201d GitLab\u2019s Guide to All-Remote will go down in history as one of the first corporate WFH-manifestos that is backed by an incredible level of detail on culture setting, long-term visions and detailed processes for making collaboration work. GitLab is also one of the rare companies that nails several trends on this list, including the promotion of results over performance, which is a topic we\u2019ll return to in a few moments. Four-day Work Weeks Are on Their Way If the Monday-to-Friday grind is getting you down, you have Henry Ford to thank. Before you think I am being sarcastic, remember that before he standardized on the five-day work week without reducing salaries in 1926, employees were clocking in every day apart from Sunday. Thank you Henry, indeed. We have become so ingrained with the five-day work week that most can scarcely believe that medieval peasants and other pre-industrial workers had shorter workweeks than we do today. Adding insult to injury, past generations also lived much longer than we often believe. The only thing they were missing was TikTok to help them pass all that free time. There have been endless murmurs and numerous trials, but today four-day work weeks seem like either an unobtainable pipe-dream or an existential threat depending on whether you ask employees or their managers. It might come as a surprise, but one country has already pulled the trigger. In 2022, Belgium made four-day workweeks possible by giving employees the legally mandated right to choose to compress their working into four days instead of five. What has gone equally unnoticed is that a growing number of companies have gone even further by making four-day work official. Rachel Sederberg, Senior Economist at Lightcast, explained that the growth rates for firms rolling out four-day workweeks are impressive. \"Our research indicates that job postings offering four-day workweeks having grown by 50% in the past 5 years,\" Rachel elaborated on their recent report on the four-day future before noting that the total share of companies embracing a shorter week remains low, approximately at 0.73%. One example of a company that ticks several trends off this list is the social media management company Buffer which is both fully remote and has a four-day workweek. Sphero, a STEM education and robotics company, is another example of companies that are in the first wave. \u201cIt's easy to ask employees to be flexible, but I\u2019ve found it to be much harder to hold yourself accountable to the same principles,\u201d Paul Copioli, Sphero\u2019s CEO, noted in our recent discussion on their workplace culture. \u201cWe\u2019ve embraced both unlimited PTO and four-day work weeks, and we\u2019re definitely not going back. Our employees love it, and our leadership team gets to love our retention, engagement and productivity rates in return,\u201d Paul added. Sphero\u2019s experiences track with what we\u2019re seeing emerge from the trials. On balance, productivity seems to stay stable, or even increase, while employee satisfaction grows. Whether four-day work weeks become the new standard is contingent on the above two parameters and how they trend. If early indicators are to be believed, competitive pressures for attracting talent will ensure that four-day work weeks are on their way to become the norm. Nordic-Style Parental Leaves Are Already Here We\u2019ve become so accustomed to dealing with one acute crisis after another that we barely lift our eyebrows when faced with an endemic one such as the impending global fertility rate disaster which will transform the world as we know it. Countries like South-Korea and Japan have been the hardest hit, and both are desperately launching new initiatives to enable and incentivize parenthood. Modern societies driving off the fertility-cliff will have repercussions far beyond the public sector however, with corporations being among the first to truly feel the pain. No babies also means no clients, employees or investors, which is why you can count on corporate leaders to start taking the fertility crisis very seriously very soon. One low-hanging fruit that already has both precedent and demand-side pressures for it is implementing longer and more generous parental leaves. There\u2019s nothing stopping CEOs from giving their staff Nordic-style parental leaves already today, and a handful of companies, including Netflix and Salesforce, are already going well beyond what is legally mandated. We\u2019re also seeing new products and financing models emerge to support companies that are willing to follow Netflix\u2019s and Salesforce\u2019s lead. \u201cWe obsess about the 12 weeks but frankly that is just not enough,\u201d Dirk Doebler, CEO of parental leave insurance provider Parento, opined in our recent discussion about how a growing number of companies are implementing Nordic-style parental leave policies. \u201cWe need to be doing more and we can\u2019t wait for the government to act before getting started. We desperately need more private solutions to this public problem. For parenthood to be appealing it needs to be much less of a trade-off than it is today, and employers are the ones who need to start working towards solutions,\u201d Dirk added. We won\u2019t solve the fertility crisis with parental leave policies alone. However, the growing pressures to do more to make parenthood possible, and enjoyable, will make increasingly generous parental leaves inevitable across the board. Managers Will Focus on Impact, Not Performance The final topic where we know change is right behind the doorstep is performance management. Performance management systems are one of the rare corporate rituals that generates dissatisfaction to almost all who engage in it, with neither managers or employees finding modern iterations meeting their needs. By now it's obvious that periodic performance appraisals that revolve around untimely and impersonal feedback based on perceptions of efficiency simply do not work. What is much less obvious is what companies should do to fix current performance appraisal frameworks. \u201cBackwards looking performance reviews are often punitive,\u201d John Schneider, CMO of Betterworks, said in our recent chat about how leadership is struggling to come up with better ways to manage performance. More worryingly, Betterwork\u2019s recent State of Performance Enablement report found that one-fifth of employees have no access to one-on-one discussions at all. \u201cReturning to draconian measures such as forced bell curves and rank-and-yank systems is not going to be the answer. What we need more of is direct managers giving direct feedback, and we believe AI will be immensely helpful in achieving that,\u201d John added. In addition to sensing a future where performance reviews will be more personal and better informed by individually relevant KPIs and OKRs, we can also see change coming in what we consider to be performance worth pursuing to begin with. As GitLab\u2019s Guide to All-Remote rightfully states, all-remote work promotes the results of work over the hours put in. As more companies adopt remote set-ups, and as performance reviews become more direct and personal, we inch closer to a future where the act of performance matters much less than the impact of our work. What\u2019s more, impact might not be defined simply as what achieved for the company for much longer. Companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry\u2019s are pioneers in identifying and promoting deep impact that extends well into matters of sustainability, social responsibility and beyond. Given the major trendlines acronyms such as ESG, CSR and DEI are seeing, it\u2019s only a matter of time until our concepts of performance management absorbs them into its folds.

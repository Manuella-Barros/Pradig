After witnessing a century of adversity, still he fights for justice Otto \u0160imko, World War II veteran and former underground resistance fighter, recently celebrated his 100th birthday. Born in Topo\u013e\u010dany, in western Slovakia, to a Jewish family, he first experienced as a boy the anti-Semitic regulations imposed by the emerging Nazi-allied Slovak State. He avoided deportation to a Nazi concentration camp, but was sent to a labour camp in the town of Vyhne, central Slovakia, in 1942. He then took part in the Slovak National Uprising (SNP). After being detained and undergoing brutal interrogations, he managed to escape from prison. Between 1954 and 1971, he worked as a journalist at the newspaper Smena; from 1971, under the supervision of the communist-era \u0160tB secret police, he served as a corporate lawyer, the Nation\u2019s Memory Institute (\u00daPN) wrote. Today, he remains a defender and promoter of freedom. Recently, he was one of the faces of the Ammunition for Ukraine crowdfunding project. Among those to congratulate him was President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, who paid him a personal visit at the Ohel David facility, which was established as the first Jewish home for the elderly with a nationwide scope. It is also the only facility of its kind in Slovakia for Holocaust survivors. \u201cWe debated about everything \u2013 present-day Slovakia, the past, society, politics and his life,\u201d \u010caputov\u00e1 wrote on Facebook. \u201cToday, many appreciate his rational approach to historical facts and lifelong optimism, unfeigned modesty, sense of justice, resistance to false heroism and lies, rare capacity for critical self-reflection and sympathetic sense of irony and self-deprecation.\u201d Two of Slovakia\u2019s zoos win recognition Two of Slovakia\u2019s zoos have recently been awarded for their upbringing of young animals. The zoo in Bratislava placed second in the Mammals category of the prestigious White Elephant competition for its care of Sumatran orangutans. The competition awards exceptional achievements by zoos in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. As Alexandra Ritterov\u00e1, the zoo\u2019s PR manager, told the TASR newswire, the young male, named Cahya, is the first successfully bred Sumatran orangutan in the whole of Slovakia. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that we could be part of this competition in a category full of amazing zoos,\u201d the zoo wrote on Facebook, thanking everybody who helps them with their mission to protect rare species. Third place in the same category was taken by the zoo in Bojnice, western Slovakia, for its care of four European wildcat cubs. \u201cThe joy is even greater as we have already released one of last year\u2019s cubs into the wild,\u201d the zoo wrote on Facebook. Preserving traditional sheep farming Despite a decline in traditional mountain sheep farming in Slovakia, there are still people preserving the practice. Several of them are active on the territory of the Slovak Paradise National Park. For example, the farm in Hrabu\u0161ice breeds about 800 sheep \u2013 specifically, improved Wallachian sheep, native Wallachian sheep and Slovak milk sheep. They graze the slopes of Zelen\u00e1 Hora mountain and near the well-known tourist centre of Podlesok, the national park wrote on Facebook. In another locality, Straten\u00e1 P\u00edla, which is situated in the southern part of the park, there is a herd of more than 150 native Wallachian sheep. \u201cThe national park\u2019s nature offers the sheep nutritious pasture on the mountain meadows, and the sheep, in turn, help preserve the species diversity of plants,\u201d the conservationists wrote. In order to lure a younger generation to sheep farming, the shepherds and sheep breeders have lately started receiving more money for their work. Five feel-good stories published by The Slovak Spectator to read: Explore the Tokaj wine-making region in eastern Slovakia, which offers not only wine, but also camping in treetops and water tourism. A once-forgotten Slovak, Andrej Babjak, was among thousands of soldiers who, as part of the Allied forces, landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, 80 years ago. Travelling freely while working remotely by using technology and the internet has become popular amongst Slovaks, especially during and since the Covid-19 pandemic. But how to become a digital nomad? Bratislava has a new road sign, introducing a so-called Kiss and Go zone. The original name of a village known officially as Spi\u0161sk\u00e9 Bystr\u00e9, which is situated in the Horn\u00e1d river basin in eastern Slovakia, was supposed to be buried in the past. However, the old name, Kubachy, still lives on. Political meme of the week Caption: They blocked my channel. With this meme, caricaturist Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Sliacky reacts to the decision by video-sharing platform YouTube to cancel a channel that had belonged to the notorious Slovak extremist and conspiracy theorist Daniel Bombic, also known as Danny Kollar. By the standards of Slovak-language channels it had a large following on the platform \u2013 79,500 people \u2013 and his videos had received more than 12 million views in the past seven months. Several coalition politicians have willingly appeared on his online show. Three European arrest warrants have been issued against the Slovak for extremism and the unauthorised handling of personal data. Bombic currently lives in London but in April a court there ordered his extradition to Slovakia. The decision is still subject to appeal.

I wanted a good result, it\u00b4s not happening,\" he said.\n\nBefore making the IOC Refugee Olympic Team, Tiranvalipour fought for eight years as a member of the Iranian national team, winning the gold medal at the 2015 Asian Junior championship back in 2015.\n\nBut Tiranvalipour, who also worked as a TV presenter and studied sports science, was forced to leave his country after speaking out in favor of women\u00b4s rights, losing his job. In October 2022, he traveled to Turkey, then to Italy where he lived in a forest for 10 days and then slept three months on a sofa in a shared accommodation that Iranian students had helped him find.\n\n\"Our journey is too difficult,\" he said after his loss to Ismail. \"Not for me, for all the refugee athletes. It\u00b4s too difficult for each of us to be here.\"\n\nPalestine's Omar Yaser Ismail, left, competes with Refugees Olympic Team's Hadi Tiranvalipour in a men's 58kg Taekwondo match during the 2024 Summer Olympics, at the Grand Palais, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)\n\nAthletes from the refugee team compete under the same flag and come from different parts of the world. The team was created for the Rio Olympics in 2016 as a symbol of hope and to call attention to the plight of refugees worldwide.\n\nAfter training alone in a park, Tiranvalipour finally approached the Italian federation, which helped him apply for asylum and settle for good in the country.\n\nIn the buildup to the Games, he trained at Olympic Sports Center in Roma with the likes of Vito Dell\u00b4aquila, the defending Olympic champion.\n\nAfter missing out on Olympic qualification during European qualifiers in March, he was selected by the refugee Olympic team and had big expectations in Paris.\n\n\"I\u00b4m not satisfied because I had too much sacrifices about my losing weight process, my training. I\u00b4m really sad,\" he said. \"We passed so many difficult journeys. If you have a target, you have to keep going. Life is like this. I have to accept (my loss) and I have to think about the future.\"\n\nMore Paris Olympics news: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nPalestine's Omar Yaser Ismail, left, competes with Refugees Olympic Team's Hadi Tiranvalipour in a men's 58kg Taekwondo match during the 2024 Summer Olympics, at the Grand Palais, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Paris, France.

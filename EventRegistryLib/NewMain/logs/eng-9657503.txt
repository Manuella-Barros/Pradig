Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"As we need the Chinese market to remain open, therefore we are also longing to keep the European market open,\" he said.\n\nThe EU announced last week that it would raise tariffs on Chinese EVs by up to 38 per cent from July 4, after a seven-month probe revealed some of the world's leading EV makers had undercut European competitors with the help of vast state subsidies.\n\nGermany, which is expected to be affected the most by possible retaliation from Beijing, has already lobbied intensely against the duties.\n\nFor German carmakers, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen, China has been one of the most important markets. And their close involvement with local partners and Chinese governments has deeply shaped economic relations between Beijing and Berlin.\n\nMany German auto giants have also bet heavily on the new-energy industrial chain in China for their own green transformations.\n\n\"The industry also made quite clear statements that tariffs, as suggested now by the EU, will not increase the competitiveness of the automotive industry. Therefore, we [...] advocate for investing into the competitiveness of the European Union, rather than trying to protect the auto industry [with tariffs],\" Butek said.\n\nThe new tariffs are likely to trigger intense negotiations between Beijing and Brussels, with China having vowed to take countermeasures. The EU must decide by November whether to adopt the tariffs permanently.\n\nRobert Habeck, German vice-chancellor and minister for economic affairs and climate action, will start a two-day visit to China on Thursday, with negotiations on EV tariffs high on the agenda.\n\nUntil the final deadline in November, \"we hope that China and the European Union can still find ways through negotiation which are quite fair\", Butek said.\n\n\"The market share of Chinese EVs in the European Union is still so small that I think there is enough space to negotiate rather than fostering these tariff escalations,\" he said.\n\nHe added that German carmakers in China do not see \"unfair subsidies from the government\" - the basis for the EU's decision - as a major operational challenge.\n\nBut he said the German government should continue pushing for fair competition for its firms operating in China, especially as Chinese companies in the automotive industry are already seen as technological leaders.\n\n\"German companies need policymakers to take action towards establishing a level playing field and providing a transparent regulatory environment in China,\" said Clas Neumann, chairman of the board of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China.\n\nAlso on Friday, the chamber released the results of a recent business survey conducted in May. It showed that although German companies operating in China are increasing their turnover expectations, optimism about the Chinese economy has been slow to return.\n\nPrice pressure has been the biggest challenge German firms have faced this year, especially in the automobile and machinery industries, according to the survey, which was conducted among 186 member companies.\n\n\"We have more and more local competitors on par with our own companies,\" Neumann said. \"Therefore, there is a significant price pressure now inside the markets due to a higher number of competitors or a higher output of products of those competitors.\"\n\nThis competition has been magnified by weak demand in China and abroad, he added.\n\nChina's automotive sector has been engaged in a price war over the past two years, with EV makers continuing to intensify their bid for a bigger piece of the world's biggest automobile market.\n\nAccording to the survey, three-quarters of German companies reported overcapacity in their industries in China, with around half of these firms saying the overcapacity had only been seen since last year, and 96 per cent saying that the excess capacity was affecting their business.\n\nAmong the respondents, 38 per cent expected an improvement in China's economic situation in the coming six months, while 16 per cent said they expected the economy to weaken.\n\nThe business outlook also appeared to be improving slightly, with 38 per cent of respondents anticipating a worsening situation for their industry compared with 2023 - a significant decrease from 52 per cent in September.\n\nAnd 29 per cent of respondents expected their industry outlook to improve compared with 2023 - a slight increase of 8 percentage points from September.\n\nMeanwhile, 39 per cent of companies projected that their turnover would increase in 2024 compared with last year, up from 13 per cent in September of last year.\n\nStill, only 53 per cent of respondents were planning to increase their investments in China over the coming two years - down from 61 per cent in September - while 16 per cent were looking to invest less.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

And their close involvement with local partners and Chinese governments has deeply shaped economic relations between Beijing and Berlin.\n\nMany German auto giants have also bet heavily on the new-energy industrial chain in China for their own green transformations.\n\n\u201cThe industry also made quite clear statements that tariffs, as suggested now by the EU, will not increase the competitiveness of the automotive industry. Therefore, we [\u2026] advocate for investing into the competitiveness of the European Union, rather than trying to protect the auto industry [with tariffs],\u201d Butek said.\n\nThe new tariffs are likely to trigger intense negotiations between Beijing and Brussels, with China having vowed to take countermeasures. The EU must decide by November whether to adopt the tariffs permanently.\n\nRobert Habeck, German vice-chancellor and minister for economic affairs and climate action, will start a two-day visit to China on Thursday, with negotiations on EV tariffs high on the agenda.\n\nUntil the final deadline in November, \u201cwe hope that China and the European Union can still find ways through negotiation which are quite fair\u201d, Butek said.\n\n\u201cThe market share of Chinese EVs in the European Union is still so small that I think there is enough space to negotiate rather than fostering these tariff escalations,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that German carmakers in China do not see \u201cunfair subsidies from the government\u201d \u2013 the basis for the EU\u2019s decision \u2013 as a major operational challenge.\n\nBut he said the German government should continue pushing for fair competition for its firms operating in China, especially as Chinese companies in the automotive industry are already seen as technological leaders.\n\n\u201cGerman companies need policymakers to take action towards establishing a level playing field and providing a transparent regulatory environment in China,\u201d said Clas Neumann, chairman of the board of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China.\n\nAlso on Friday, the chamber released the results of a recent business survey conducted in May. It showed that although German companies operating in China are increasing their turnover expectations, optimism about the Chinese economy has been slow to return.\n\nPrice pressure has been the biggest challenge German firms have faced this year, especially in the automobile and machinery industries, according to the survey, which was conducted among 186 member companies.\n\n\u201cWe have more and more local competitors on par with our own companies,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cTherefore, there is a significant price pressure now inside the markets due to a higher number of competitors or a higher output of products of those competitors.\u201d\n\nThis competition has been magnified by weak demand in China and abroad, he added.\n\nChina\u2019s automotive sector has been engaged in a price war over the past two years, with EV makers continuing to intensify their bid for a bigger piece of the world\u2019s biggest automobile market.\n\nAccording to the survey, three-quarters of German companies reported overcapacity in their industries in China, with around half of these firms saying the overcapacity had only been seen since last year, and 96 per cent saying that the excess capacity was affecting their business.\n\nAmong the respondents, 38 per cent expected an improvement in China\u2019s economic situation in the coming six months, while 16 per cent said they expected the economy to weaken.\n\nThe business outlook also appeared to be improving slightly, with 38 per cent of respondents anticipating a worsening situation for their industry compared with 2023 \u2013 a significant decrease from 52 per cent in September.\n\nAnd 29 per cent of respondents expected their industry outlook to improve compared with 2023 \u2013 a slight increase of 8 percentage points from September.\n\nMeanwhile, 39 per cent of companies projected that their turnover would increase in 2024 compared with last year, up from 13 per cent in September of last year.\n\nStill, only 53 per cent of respondents were planning to increase their investments in China over the coming two years \u2013 down from 61 per cent in September \u2013 while 16 per cent were looking to invest less.",

Chinese electric vehicles are counterproductive.\n\nChina is one of Germany's top trading partners, accounting for a significant portion of their sales in recent years.\n\nBut 61 percent of 186 German companies surveyed by the German Chamber of Commerce said \"pressure on prices\" is by far the biggest problem they face in China.\n\nWeak demand linked to the slowdown in the world's second-largest economy and geopolitical tensions also ranked among the top concerns, the report showed.\n\nCarmakers made up 21 percent of companies surveyed.\n\nChina is the world's largest car market and the most advanced in terms of electric vehicle (EV) production.\n\nREAD: EU seeks roadblocks for Chinese EVs without sparking trade war\n\nDozens of Chinese EV brands have been established in recent years, supported by state subsidies.\n\nBut China's economic slowdown, which is weighing on consumer spending, has led to a price war between manufacturers, impacting profits.\n\nPrice pressure\n\nForeign manufacturers, who have struggled to adapt to the rapid expansion of China's EV fleet, are now also competing against Chinese vehicles on home turf.\n\nPrice pressure \"is of course a result of overcapacity, but our companies are quite aligned on that -- that they only can survive those times if they become more competitive,\" Maximilian Butek, head of the German Chamber of Commerce, said at a presentation Friday.\n\nThe European Union and China are locked in a row over planned new tariffs of up to 38 percent on imports of Chinese EVs.\n\nThe European Commission, which launched a probe last year into Chinese EV subsidies, has accused Beijing of unfair practices undercutting Europe's car manufacturers.\n\nREAD: EU to take 'targeted' approach on any illegal China subsidies\n\nGermany has previously expressed concerns about applying higher tariffs, fearing reprisals for its car giants, such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which are heavily invested in China.\n\n\"Tariffs as suggested now by the EU will not increase the competitiveness of the automotive industry,\" Butek said.\n\n\"Therefore, we (would) rather advocate for investing into the competitiveness of the European Union, rather than trying to protect the auto industry,\" he said, adding that German manufacturers are \"dependent\" on the Chinese market.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck will

It has urged dialogue while also expecting China to compromise.\n\n\"Habeck should act as a mediator between the EU and China here and resolve a trade dispute early in the interests of German small and medium enterprises,\" said Patrick Schoenowski, from the German Association for SMEs, DMB.\n\n\"The aim of the negotiations with China should be to resolve the root causes of the punitive tariffs.\"\n\nHabeck's ministry has outlined the goals for the trip as explaining Germany's trade and economic policy to China, including its need for energy diversification. But the car tariff issue is unavoidable.\n\n\"Of course, the Minister will have no choice but to address this issue, that is quite clear,\" a ministry spokesperson said.\n\n\"But he is not conducting talks on behalf of the EU Commission, that is the task of the Commission.\"\n\nTARGETING EXCESSIVE SUBSIDIES\n\nThe European Commission said it would impose extra duties on Chinese electric cars from July to combat excessive subsidies.\n\nThe state-backed China Daily newspaper expressed hope that \"proper solutions\" could be found during Habeck's talks with Chinese officials before the tariffs come into force.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who visited China in April, has not criticised the EU tariffs directly but warned about the dangers of protectionism.\n\nJuergen Matthes, from the German economic institute IW, said the framing of the tariff issue will be crucial.\n\n\"If the EU has sufficient evidence of unfair subsidies, imposing extra duties is not protectionism, but rather an attempt to establish a level playing field,\" he told Reuters.\n\nThe German industry association BDI expects Habeck to communicate Germany's stated aim of \"de-risking\" from China rather than \"decoupling\" and turning its back on business there.\n\n\"He must cleverly explain where the limits are, why we perceive China as a systemic competitor and demand the reduction of market distortions,\" a BDI source said.\n\nHabeck, who comes from the Greens party in Scholz's three-way coalition government, will also raise climate protection as well as long-standing trade bugbears such as fair competition for German firms and transparent public tenders.\n\n\"We expect that the Chinese government will now be more open to change, because they really must not lose Europe,\" said Maximilian Butek, executive director and board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China.\n\n\"On the other hand, they are so competitive in so many areas that they don't really need these protective mechanisms anymore.\"\n\nWhile Scholz took the CEOs of major German firms on his trip in April, Habeck's delegation focuses \"deliberately on SMEs in order to give this backbone of the German economy appropriate recognition abroad during such trips,\" a ministry source said.\n\nSMEs often do not have their own channels to the Chinese government, the source added.\n\nHabeck, who visits Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, will also attend the German-Chinese Climate and Transformation Dialogue.\n\nBefore travelling to China, he will go to South Korea, one of the countries where German companies are seeking to invest as part of a de-risking strategy.

It has urged dialogue while also expecting China to compromise.\n\n\"Habeck should act as a mediator between the EU and China here and resolve a trade dispute early in the interests of German small and medium enterprises,\" said Patrick Schoenowski, from the German Association for SMEs, DMB.\n\n\"The aim of the negotiations with China should be to resolve the root causes of the punitive tariffs.\"\n\nHabeck's ministry has outlined the goals for the trip as explaining Germany's trade and economic policy to China, including its need for energy diversification. But the car tariff issue is unavoidable.\n\n\"Of course, the Minister will have no choice but to address this issue, that is quite clear,\" a ministry spokesperson said.\n\n\"But he is not conducting talks on behalf of the EU Commission, that is the task of the Commission.\"\n\nTARGETING EXCESSIVE SUBSIDIES\n\nThe European Commission said it would impose extra duties on Chinese electric cars from July to combat excessive subsidies.\n\nThe state-backed China Daily newspaper expressed hope that \"proper solutions\" could be found during Habeck's talks with Chinese officials before the tariffs come into force.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who visited China in April, has not criticised the EU tariffs directly but warned about the dangers of protectionism.\n\nJuergen Matthes, from the German economic institute IW, said the framing of the tariff issue will be crucial.\n\n\"If the EU has sufficient evidence of unfair subsidies, imposing extra duties is not protectionism, but rather an attempt to establish a level playing field,\" he told Reuters.\n\nThe German industry association BDI expects Habeck to communicate Germany's stated aim of \"de-risking\" from China rather than \"decoupling\" and turning its back on business there.\n\n\"He must cleverly explain where the limits are, why we perceive China as a systemic competitor and demand the reduction of market distortions,\" a BDI source said.\n\nHabeck, who comes from the Greens party in Scholz's three-way coalition government, will also raise climate protection as well as long-standing trade bugbears such as fair competition for German firms and transparent public tenders.\n\n\"We expect that the Chinese government will now be more open to change, because they really must not lose Europe,\" said Maximilian Butek, executive director and board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China.\n\n\"On the other hand, they are so competitive in so many areas that they don't really need these protective mechanisms anymore.\"\n\nWhile Scholz took the CEOs of major German firms on his trip in April, Habeck's delegation focuses \"deliberately on SMEs in order to give this backbone of the German economy appropriate recognition abroad during such trips,\" a ministry source said.\n\nSMEs often do not have their own channels to the Chinese government, the source added.\n\nHabeck, who visits Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, will also attend the German-Chinese Climate and Transformation Dialogue.\n\nBefore travelling to China, he will go to South Korea, one of the countries where German companies are seeking to invest as part of a de-risking strategy.

This move has strained economic relations and prompted China to issue threats of retaliation.\n\nAlso Read | Summer Solstice 2024 Date and Time: When Is the Longest Day of the Year? FAQs About the Estival Solstice or Midsummer Answered.\n\nHabeck also wants to address Germany's de-risking strategy in its dealings with China, which is aimed at stopping Berlin from becoming overly entwined with the world's second-largest economy.\n\nHabeck is set to discuss climate protection and longstanding trade issues, including fair competition for German companies and transparent public tenders. His itinerary includes visits to the BMW research center in Shanghai, discussions with Chinese students in Hangzhou, and a scheduled visit to e-commerce giant Alibaba.\n\nAddressing the thorny issue of EV tariffs\n\nLast week, the European Commission said it was planning to impose tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese electric vehicles from July 4. It followed warnings from EU policymakers that Europe was being swamped with cheap Chinese EVs. They accused Beijing of backing major production overcapacity to allow Chinese automakers to grow their share of the global EV market.\n\nIn response to the EU's decsion to hike EV tariffs, China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Monday that it would launch an anti-dumping investigation into certain pork products imported from the EU, which totalled over $3 billion last year, according to Beijing customs data.\n\nAfter China announced its pork probe, the European Commission said it \"will follow the proceedings very closely in coordination with EU industry and our member states.\"\n\n\"We will intervene as appropriate to ensure that the investigation fully complies with all relevant World Trade Organization rules,\" spokesperson Olof Gill said.\n\nThe exchange prompted concerns from the German car industry over a potential tit-for-tat trade war, leading Chinese automakers to urge Beijing to increase tariffs on European gasoline-powered cars as a retaliatory measure, as reported by the state-backed Global Times.\n\nThe newspaper quoted Cui Hongjian, professor of European Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, as saying that Habeck's visit was an opportunity for the German government to emphasize bilateral cooperation rather than confrontation.\n\nGermany has previously expressed concerns about applying higher tariffs, fearing reprisals for its car giants, such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which are heavily invested in China.\n\nWill Habeck manage China-EU relations amid tariff tensions?\n\n\"Habeck should act as a mediator between the EU and China here and resolve a trade dispute early in the interests of German small and medium enterprises,\" said Patrick Schoenowski from the German Association for SMEs (DMB), which advocates for their economic and political interests.\n\nThe China Daily newspaper expressed hope that \"proper solutions\" could be found during Habeck's talks with Chinese officials before the tariffs come into effect on July 4.\n\nBut Habeck's ministry pointed out that he is \"not conducting talks on behalf of the EU Commission, that is the task of the Commission.\"", "source": {"uri":

Germany's capital goods sector, called on Habeck to address the issue of overcapacity in China.\n\nIn some segments, such as construction machinery, this has led to significant market distortions in Europe, said VDMA's head of foreign trade, Ulrich Ackermann.\n\n\"There is a risk that this phenomenon will also be observed in other mechanical engineering sectors in the near future,\" said Ackermann.\n\nThere will likely be additional questions for Habeck about his proposals to tighten the process for reviewing foreign investments, which would lead to addidional scrutiny for Chinese companies seeking to acquire stakes in German firms.\n\nHabeck's ministry is said to have considered canceling the trip to China because Beijing had not made any definite commitments for weeks, according to Noah Barkin, a senior fellow in the Indo-Pacific Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMFUS), based in Berlin.\n\nHe suggested that the apparent lack of commitment was due in part to the China-critical stance of Habeck and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who emphasized a balanced approach in Berlin's relations with China.\n\n\"Due to the delay, Habeck left Germany three days later than originally planned and has made South Korea the first stop on his itinerary instead of China,\" said Barkin.\n\nLast year, German direct investment in China rose to a record \u20ac11.9 billion ($12.9 billion), showing that firms continue to plough money into a country that Berlin calls a systemic rival.\n\nThis article was originally published in German.",

The survey was released by the chamber in Beijing on Friday.\n\nAround 30 percent of the surveyed companies are involved in machinery and industrial equipment, while others are in automotive, mobility, business services, electronics and chemicals.\n\nTheir business outlook regarding China is recovering, and 29 percent of respondents expect their industry to improve compared to the previous year, up 8 percentage points over last year.\n\nBesides, 39 percent of German companies operating in China projected their turnovers to increase by the end of this year compared to last year, while their anticipation of profits remains unchanged. When asked the same question last year, only 13 percent were expecting increased turnover, the survey found. On the biggest challenges that German businesses face in China, they said price pressures take center stage.\n\nThe survey comes at a time when the European Union has decided to impose additional tariffs of 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent on electric cars produced in China.\n\n\"The move by the European Union will not help increase the competitiveness of the industry. The market share of Chinese-made electric vehicles in Europe is still so small. There is so much more cooperation going on between China and the EU, and we need to keep pushing for fair competition,\" said Maximilian Butek, executive director at the German Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nButek added that several German companies operating in China are utilizing the \"local for local\" strategy, and keeping their Chinese business as resilient as possible.\n\nChina has been Germany's largest trading partner for eight consecutive years, followed by the United States and the Netherlands. In 2023, Germany's direct investment in China increased by 4.3 percent year-on-year to 11.9 billion euros ($12.7 billion), a record high, according to Deutsche Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany.\n\nIn addition, Germany is China's largest trading partner in Europe and an important investment destination, the Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nThe automotive industry has been a highlight of Sino-German economic and trade cooperation. The two countries have continuously strengthened cooperation and jointly promoted green and low-carbon transformation of the automotive industry.\n\nIn late April, German automaker BMW Group said it plans to invest an additional 20 billion yuan in its production base in Shenyang, Northeast China's Liaoning province.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeast China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bundesbank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bundesbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liaoning"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liaoning"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shenyang"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shenyang"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Associations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202406/18/6670db68a31095c551b394cc.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657503", "eventUri": "eng-9657503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

It has urged dialogue while also expecting China to compromise.\n\n\"Habeck should act as a mediator between the EU and China here and resolve a trade dispute early in the interests of German small and medium enterprises,\" said Patrick Schoenowski, from the German Association for SMEs, DMB.\n\n\"The aim of the negotiations with China should be to resolve the root causes of the punitive tariffs.\"\n\nHabeck's ministry has outlined the goals for the trip as explaining Germany's trade and economic policy to China, including its need for energy diversification. But the car tariff issue is unavoidable.\n\n\"Of course, the Minister will have no choice but to address this issue, that is quite clear,\" a ministry spokesperson said.\n\n\"But he is not conducting talks on behalf of the EU Commission, that is the task of the Commission.\"\n\nTARGETING EXCESSIVE SUBSIDIES\n\nThe European Commission said it would impose extra duties on Chinese electric cars from July to combat excessive subsidies.\n\nThe state-backed China Daily newspaper expressed hope that \"proper solutions\" could be found during Habeck's talks with Chinese officials before the tariffs come into force.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who visited China in April, has not criticised the EU tariffs directly but warned about the dangers of protectionism.\n\nJuergen Matthes, from the German economic institute IW, said the framing of the tariff issue will be crucial.\n\n\"If the EU has sufficient evidence of unfair subsidies, imposing extra duties is not protectionism, but rather an attempt to establish a level playing field,\" he told Reuters.\n\nThe German industry association BDI expects Habeck to communicate Germany's stated aim of \"de-risking\" from China rather than \"decoupling\" and turning its back on business there.\n\n\"He must cleverly explain where the limits are, why we perceive China as a systemic competitor and demand the reduction of market distortions,\" a BDI source said.\n\nHabeck, who comes from the Greens party in Scholz's three-way coalition government, will also raise climate protection as well as long-standing trade bugbears such as fair competition for German firms and transparent public tenders.\n\n\"We expect that the Chinese government will now be more open to change, because they really must not lose Europe,\" said Maximilian Butek, executive director and board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China.\n\n\"On the other hand, they are so competitive in so many areas that they don't really need these protective mechanisms anymore.\"\n\nWhile Scholz took the CEOs of major German firms on his trip in April, Habeck's delegation focuses \"deliberately on SMEs in order to give this backbone of the German economy appropriate recognition abroad during such trips,\" a ministry source said.\n\nSMEs often do not have their own channels to the Chinese government, the source added.\n\nHabeck, who visits Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, will also attend the German-Chinese Climate and Transformation Dialogue.\n\nBefore travelling to China, he will go to South Korea, one of the countries where German companies are seeking to invest as part of a de-risking strategy. In Seoul he will meet Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and his counterpart, Trade Minister Ahn Dukgeun.

After sanctioning Chinese telecommunications conglomerate Huawei, and restricting the imports of Chinese-made batteries, steel and critical minerals, the United States and the European Union have announced tariffs of up to 100 percent and 38.1 percent, respectively, on electric vehicles (EVs) imported from China.\n\nThe core argument of the US and the EU for imposing the tariffs is that EV-makers in China benefit heavily from government subsidies, and China's overcapacity in EV batteries is the result of the Chinese government's industrial policy and subsidies.\n\nThe protectionist path chosen by the Joe Biden administration was laid by the Donald Trump administration and threatens to drastically slow the growth of global trade and the development of global value chains, affecting the international division of labor. This will impinge on the likely advantages of fair competition and free market on which Western economic theories rest.\n\nIn such a situation, China is bound to take countermeasures. But even if it doesn't, the Western economies' protectionist measures against Chinese exports will hurt Western companies which have manufacturing units in and export their products from China. Highlighting this fact recently, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said half of the EVs imported from China are manufactured by Western companies.\n\nAs a matter of fact, no less than German Transportation Minister Volker Wissing expressed concerns over the tariffs, saying the EU's move will deal a blow to German companies and their products, adding that cars must become cheaper through more competition, open markets and significantly better business conditions in the EU, not through trade war and market isolation. Several German carmakers, including Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, too, have spoken against the tariffs.\n\nAnd the president of the German Association of Automotive Industry (VDA), Hildegard Muller, has said tariffs will not solve the problems facing the auto industry, stressing that instead of imposing tariffs, efforts should focus on making the EU more attractive for manufacturers.\n\nGiven its economic strength, China can disrupt the free flow of global trade in ways that would hurt Western carmakers. But it won't do so because that could lead to a full-fledged trade war, which incidentally some Western leaders want as it would help them decouple their countries' economies with China's, resulting in losses for all economies, including the US, the EU, Japan and China.\n\nThe West has adhered to the theory of comparative advantage with almost religious zeal since British economist David Ricardo propounded it in 1817. The theory is at the heart of the aspirations that, for instance, shape the rules advocated by the World Trade Organization, which until recently was strongly supported by the Western economies. But now that the comparative advantages have shifted eastward, the Western economies are out to defy the theory.\n\nThe question that arises is: Which economies would be the losers and which the winners if all economies resorted to protectionism? Before that question is answered, it ought to be mentioned that the US has made strenuous efforts to unify the Western economies against a supposed \"common enemy\", in order to maintain its global hegemony. But this strategy has almost never proved successful. What would happen in a hypothetical situation of the US succeeding in containing China? Without a perceived common enemy, the Western economies most probably would be locked in fierce competitions, leading to fierce trade wars.\n\nTo know which economies would end up as the losers and which the winners, we need to know which economies have a market large enough to achieve a high rate of growth, excel in competition and benefit from the international division of labor so as to compensate, even if partly, for the de-globalization of the world economy.\n\nChina has a massive and still growing domestic market. It has a high rate of savings and investment. It has demonstrated capability to further enhance R&D, realize technological diversification, and boost its national strength. These factors place China in a relatively advantageous position to minimize the negative impact of a world without free and fair global trade.\n\nChina wants to prevent the global economies from engaging in a protectionist war. But to at least win the intellectual debate on the issue, the Chinese government ought to take the initiative to resolve the issue. Asking the relevant questions is one way of showing that the core reason behind the current situation is that China's companies are more efficient and competitive than their Western counterparts in most fields.\n\nFurther proof of Western hypocrisy can be found in their agricultural policy. The agricultural sector in both the US and the EU is heavily subsidized -- by tens of billions of dollars a year. The two economies also impose punitive tariffs on imports from quite a few countries.\n\nFor instance, the EU imposes a heavy tariff on imported bananas to protect uncompetitive farmers from the Canary Islands. The EU cannot justify imposing the tariffs on farm produce from countries such as Costa Rica, Ecuador and Honduras, because banana producers in those countries do not get any subsidies. The only reason why the EU imposes tariffs on banana imports is that banana producers in the EU cannot compete with their Latin American counterparts.\n\nIn short, the tariffs imposed by the EU and the US on Chinese-made EVs are a means to protect their domestic car industry from the more competitive Chinese carmakers. In the eyes of the EU and the US, China's sin is not that it has robust industrial policy, but because it exhibits a high degree of efficiency and competitiveness.\n\nThe author is a professor at Instituto Empresarial University in Spain, a senior fellow at the Beijing Club for International Dialogue and was special adviser to the president of Costa Rica from 2018-2022.

It would be expedient if we manage to overcome the existing challenges through dialogue and primarily strive for partnership-based formats and solutions.\"\n\nThe German Federal Association for Economic Development and Foreign Trade said that the EU's additional tariffs on Chinese BEVs send a wrong signal at the wrong time.

However, protectionism is hindering the mobility transition... Possible countermeasures from the Chinese side could affect a core industry in our country and further damage Germany as a business location in difficult times.\"\n\nChina provides a large market for the EU, according to the latest data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.

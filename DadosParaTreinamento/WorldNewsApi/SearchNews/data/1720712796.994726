However, Bethesda does have Fallout 76 up its sleeve at least, and the latest expansion of the multiplayer RPG is just a few days away. The publisher revealed the Skyline Valley expansion during the Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday. The DLC expands the map for the first time into a new region called Shenandoah. The telethon-themed trailer offers a peek at some of what's in store. For instance, you'll be able to explore the remnants of Vault 63 and try to discover what happened to its dwellers. As you might expect, there will also be Ghouls to contend with. The trailer ends on a spicy tease, as starting early next year, you'll actually be able to play as a Ghoul. Fallout 76 had a rough debut, but by all accounts the game has gotten much better over time (following in the footsteps of some other Bethesda games). As with other Fallout titles, it had a huge surge in players in the wake of the Prime Video show. On Steam alone, the average number of concurrent players shot up nearly fivefold from 5,975 in March to 25,673 in April. With so many new and returning players enjoying the game, it\u2019s nice that they won\u2019t have to wait long for more things to see and do. Skyline Valley, which is free for Fallout 76 players on all platforms, will arrive on June 12.", "summary": "<div id=\"da159d8ca55a4940b86efe4da854c061\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yHLtDrbLqw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p>It seemed like a missed opportunity for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/bethesda/\">Bethesda</a> to not have a new Fallout <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/\">game</a> ready to capitalize on the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fallout-has-already-scored-a-green-light-for-a-second-season-103013664.html\">TV adaptation&#39;s success</a>.

There are plenty of other ways to celebrate the moon landing, including the new film \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" a light-hearted lookback starring Scarlett Johansson.\n\nAnd you can explore all things Apollo 11 on a special website by the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.\n\nIf nothing else, soak in the full moon Saturday night into Sunday morning.\n\nHere's a rundown of some Apollo 11 tributes:\n\n'The Eagle has landed'\n\nNASA's Kennedy Space Center is holding a moon fest at its tourist stop, just a few miles from where the Saturn V rocket thundered away with Armstrong, Aldrin and Michael Collins on July 16, 1969. Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "roanoke.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roanoke Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@roanoke.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds (22 kilograms) of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.", "source": {"uri": "weareiowa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local 5 - weareiowa.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here.

Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos.

Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing \"Man walks on the Moon\" \"Man on Moon\" \"On the Moon!\" \"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\" \"Walk on Moon!\" \"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\" \"We're on the Moon\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\" \"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"Today the moon, tomorrow....\" \"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\" \"Americans walk on Moon\" \"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\" \"Man realizes his age-old dream\" 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@siouxcityjournal.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "marcio_jose_sanchez@siouxcityjournal.com", "name": "Marcio Jose Sanchez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Woodbury County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woodbury County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing \"Man walks on the Moon\" \"Man on Moon\" \"On the Moon!\" \"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\" \"Walk on Moon!\" \"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\" \"We're on the Moon\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\" \"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"Today the moon, tomorrow....\" \"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\" \"Americans walk on Moon\" \"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\" \"Man realizes his age-old dream\" 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "qctimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Quad-City Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@qctimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "marcio_jose_sanchez@qctimes.com", "name": "Marcio Jose Sanchez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing \"Man walks on the Moon\" \"Man on Moon\" \"On the Moon!\" \"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\" \"Walk on Moon!\" \"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\" \"We're on the Moon\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\" \"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"Today the moon, tomorrow....\" \"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\" \"Americans walk on Moon\" \"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\" \"Man realizes his age-old dream\" Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "dothaneagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dothan Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Collins (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing \"Man walks on the Moon\" \"Man on Moon\" \"On the Moon!\" \"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\" \"Walk on Moon!\" \"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\" \"We're on the Moon\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\" \"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"Today the moon, tomorrow....\" \"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\" \"Americans walk on Moon\" \"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\" \"Man realizes his age-old dream\" 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "magicvalley.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Magic Valley"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@magicvalley.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Falls,_Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twin Falls, Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Twin Falls, Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing \"Man walks on the Moon\" \"Man on Moon\" \"On the Moon!\" \"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\" \"Walk on Moon!\" \"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\" \"We're on the Moon\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\" \"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"Today the moon, tomorrow....\" \"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\" \"Americans walk on Moon\" \"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\" \"Man realizes his age-old dream\" Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "mcdowellnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McDowellNews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@mcdowellnews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDowell_County,_West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McDowell County, West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McDowell County, West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing \"Man walks on the Moon\" \"Man on Moon\" \"On the Moon!\" \"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\" \"Walk on Moon!\" \"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\" \"We're on the Moon\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\" \"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"Today the moon, tomorrow....\" \"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\" \"Americans walk on Moon\" \"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\" \"Man realizes his age-old dream\" 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "wcfcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing\n\n\"Man walks on the Moon\"\n\n\"Man on Moon\"\n\n\"On the Moon!\"\n\n\"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\"\n\n\"Walk on Moon!\"\n\n\"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\"\n\n\"We're on the Moon\"\n\n\"Man walks on Moon\"\n\n\"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\"\n\n\"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\"\n\n\"Man walks on Moon\"\n\n\"Today the moon, tomorrow....\"\n\n\"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\"\n\n\"Americans walk on Moon\"\n\n\"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\"\n\n\"Man realizes his age-old dream\"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "nwitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nwi.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@nwitimes.com", "name": "assets", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tncms@nwitimes.com", "name": "tncms", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

He'll be joined by astronaut Charlie Duke, who was the voice inside Mission Control for the July 20, 1969 moon landing.\n\nMuseum President Jim Kidrick couldn't resist throwing a bash \"55 years to the day of one of the most historic moments in not only the history of America, but in the history of the world.\"\n\nCan't make it to San Diego, Cape Canaveral or Houston? There are plenty of other ways to celebrate the moon landing, including the new film \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" a light-hearted lookback starring Scarlett Johansson.\n\nAnd you can explore all things Apollo 11 on a special website by the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.\n\nIf nothing else, soak in the full moon Saturday night into Sunday morning.\n\nHere's a rundown of some Apollo 11 tributes:\n\nNASA's Kennedy Space Center is holding a moon fest at its tourist stop, just a few miles from where the Saturn V rocket thundered away with Armstrong, Aldrin and Michael Collins on July 16, 1969. Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining. \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles (386,000 kilometers) away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles (240 kilometers) away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins - dubbed Columbia - splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds (22 kilograms) of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year - part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology.

Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing \"Man walks on the Moon\" \"Man on Moon\" \"On the Moon!\" \"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\" \"Walk on Moon!\" \"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\" \"We're on the Moon\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\" \"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"Today the moon, tomorrow....\" \"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\" \"Americans walk on Moon\" \"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\" \"Man realizes his age-old dream\" Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "napavalleyregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Napa Valley Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@napavalleyregister.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "marcio_jose_sanchez@napavalleyregister.com", "name": "Marcio Jose Sanchez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing \"Man walks on the Moon\" \"Man on Moon\" \"On the Moon!\" \"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\" \"Walk on Moon!\" \"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\" \"We're on the Moon\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\" \"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"Today the moon, tomorrow....\" \"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\" \"Americans walk on Moon\" \"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\" \"Man realizes his age-old dream\" Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "heraldcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HeraldCourier.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@heraldcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nHeadlines: Apollo 11 Moon Landing \"Man walks on the Moon\" \"Man on Moon\" \"On the Moon!\" \"U.S. team walks on Moon, blasts off to command ship\" \"Walk on Moon!\" \"World watches 2 yanks in first walk on Moon\" \"We're on the Moon\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"American footprints, Old Glory on Moon\" \"Americans explore Moon surface, blast off for long journey home\" \"Man walks on Moon\" \"Today the moon, tomorrow....\" \"'Fantastic'.. the United States implants first human footprints on the moon\" \"Americans walk on Moon\" \"And man walks upon dead surface of the Moon\" \"Man realizes his age-old dream\" Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pantagraph.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969.

There are plenty of other ways to celebrate the moon landing, including the new film \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" a light-hearted lookback starring Scarlett Johansson.\n\nAnd you can explore all things Apollo 11 on a special website by the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.\n\nIf nothing else, soak in the full moon Saturday night into Sunday morning.\n\nHere's a rundown of some Apollo 11 tributes:\n\nNASA's Kennedy Space Center is holding a moon fest at its tourist stop, just a few miles from where the Saturn V rocket thundered away with Armstrong, Aldrin, and Michael Collins on July 16, 1969. Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. EDT with barely any fuel remaining. \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races, followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins's spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, Calif., with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center.

This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

New Movie \"Fly Me To The Moon\" Partly Based On My Book", "body": "The new film Fly Me to the Moon starring Scarlett Johansson & Channing Tatum is a romantic comedy set in the 1969 race to the moon. Johansson plays a marketing strategist planning a fake moon landing video in a NASA warehouse.\n\nI'm thrilled my book Marketing the Moon co-written with Rich Jurek was an important inspiration for the film.\n\nIn our book, we researched how NASA sold the lunar missions to the American people. We interviewed Apollo astronauts including several who walked on the moon. We spoke with public relations professionals at NASA, reporters who covered the missions, and to marketers at contractors like Boeing.\n\nThe last few weeks have been super exciting as the detailed history of the marketing and PR aspects of the Apollo program that we wrote about in our 2014 book have suddenly been thrust back into the spotlight because of the film's release.\n\nAs the experts in the marketing aspects of the Apollo program, Rich and I have done media interviews, and our book has been mentioned in dozens of news stories.\n\nHow cool is it when you establish authority in a subject, even an obscure one like what we wrote about, and suddenly your expertise is in demand!\n\nAs I said when our book originally came out a decade ago, I'm convinced the Apollo program is the most successful marketing and public relations campaign in history. Our book Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program features heroic astronauts, press-savvy rocket scientists, enthusiastic reporters, deep-pocketed defense contractors, and Tang.\n\nMany of these elements (including Tang) make an appearance in the film. Fly Me to the Moon includes details we covered in our book including product placement by Omega watches and other companies.\n\nI saw the film and it is wonderful. I will go back to see it again and when it is available, I will purchase a DVD.\n\nOne of the most important PR projects for Apollo was the inclusion of live television from the surface of the moon. In Marketing the Moon, we covered many details of the struggle to get a TV camera in space. Some in NASA wanted live television to share the lunar landing with the world and others resisted because it was a difficult technological challenge. We told their stories.\n\nLive television as a marketing strategy becomes a major storyline in the Fly Me to the Moon movie.\n\nIn a USA Today article: Is 'Fly Me to the Moon' based on a true story? What's behind fake moon landing movie, screenwriter Rose Gilroy was quoted as saying she looked to Marketing the Moon which details how NASA made the moon enticing to the masses through product placement, magazine articles and TV specials. \"It's about the original ads that were used, and how sci-fi was woven into the minds of the American people\" using genre books and movies, Gilroy says. \"That was instrumental. It was endlessly interesting to learn all the ways they sold\" the Apollo 11 mission.\n\n\"As marketers and space enthusiasts, writing marketing the moon was a passion project, a labor of love,\" my co-author Rich Jurek told me, and I totally agree! \"Its reach and influence have exceeded every expectation,\" Rich continues. \"It's a wonderful reminder that when you follow your passion, the payoff not only transcends monetary compensation, but can also lead to huge personal and professional opportunities. Instead of just focusing on Apollo as a technical and engineering achievement, Marketing the Moon literally changed the historic narrative by putting a much overdue and deserved spotlight on the pioneering marketing and PR efforts surrounding the program at both the contractors and NASA. In so doing, we've inspired two films and continue to influence a new generation's perspective on a unique but vital aspect of the program.\"\n\nHere are several stories mentioning our book:\n\nI've often said my best nonfiction book ideas came from finding patterns in the universe that nobody else has written about. If you're considering a nonfiction book, that should be your test: Is your idea a new way of looking at something?\n\nOnce you have that pattern identified, you need to share it! The more we give, the more we get back.\n\nThe importance of marketing and public relations to Apollo was a story waiting to be told. Rich and I saw the dedicated people who fought for live television and who worked to communicate with the public in ways they would appreciate is as heroic as what the astronauts did, and we were told their story in our book.\n\nThank you, Rose Gilroy, for your wonderful script. You expertly created a funny and warm film and told the stories of the thousands of NASA people in a caring and respectful way. For a comedy to also be rooted in reality is a tough needle to thread.\n\nAnd thank you Rich for agreeing to co-author Marketing the Moon. When we first discussed the ideas that became this project some 15 years ago while we were at an Apollo event together, who would have imagined what it would lead to.", "source": {"uri": "davidmeermanscott.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "davidmeermanscott.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "freshspot_marketing_llc@davidmeermanscott.com", "name": "Freshspot Marketing Llc", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fly Me to the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Live television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_placement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Product placement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channing_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Channing Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DVD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_special", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-fiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.davidmeermanscott.com/hubfs/Fly%20me%20to%20the%20Moon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746407", "eventUri": "eng-9746407", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

At the end of the 1960s, a wary NASA recognizes the need for better public relations during the Vietnam War. The resulting campaign leads to a faked version of the Apollo 11 mission being shot on a sound stage even as the real mission is unfolding. Shenanigans, and romance, ensue.\n\n\"Fly Me to the Moon\" isn't the first movie based on the mistaken belief that the moon landing was a hoax, a conspiracy theory that first arose in the 1970s. \"Capricorn One\" (1978), about a faked mission to Mars, taps into Watergate-era institutional distrust, and more recently, \"Moonwalkers\" (2015) pairs a C.I.A. agent with a rock band manager to fake the Apollo 11 landing.\n\nWhat sets \"Fly Me to the Moon\" apart is its insistence on the truth. The movie's writers say they hope it will reinforce the real story of the moon landing. But is that possible in a post-Covid age when conspiracy theories are amplified on social media?\n\nThe screenplay, written by Rose Gilroy and based on a story by Keenan Flynn and Bill Kirstein, plays with the theory, including a joke on some conspiracists' belief that the director Stanley Kubrick supposedly had a hand in faking the historic event. (He did not.) But ultimately the film emphasizes that the Apollo 11 landing did take place.\n\nFlynn said the initial idea for the movie came in 2016. As the nation wrangled with questions about truth during a presidential campaign in which Donald J. Trump frequently castigated the \"lying\" media, the moon landing made for a perfect setting.\n\n\"That was the assignment,\" Flynn said. \"How do you have your cake and eat it, too? You have fun with the fake moon landing, but you really bring home that truth matters by highlighting that achievement.\"\n\nGilroy said that she had read some books to better understand the conspiracy but that there was simply nothing to them.\n\n\"We wanted to build a story around the idea of these people coming together to ensure that the mission is real,\" she said. \"Not in any of my research did I ever come across one iota of a fact that made me question in any way the validity of this accomplishment.\"\n\nAdam Frank, an astronomer and physicist at the University of Rochester whose work focuses on science denial, said pop culture had a responsibility to fight a nihilistic tendency to doubt science and human potential.\n\n\"It's lazy writing to say 'the government was in on the conspiracy' as opposed to 'people actually all worked together and they found the answer,'\" Frank said. \"They worked for 20 years and sent a probe to Mars and it did exactly what they said they were going to do. Somehow, that is less exciting than 'It didn't work and they had a conspiracy.'\"\n\n\"Fly Me to the Moon\" does focus on the laborious team effort that went into the landing. But now that it's easier than ever to take an image out of context and spread it online, good intentions can be lost. Fretting about the film may also be quaint at this point: Images generated by artificial intelligence showing a faked-moon-landing film set went viral earlier this year.\n\nLawrence Hamilton, a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire who studies anti-science conspiracy belief, pointed to an image used by moon landing deniers as a cautionary tale. The photo, showing astronauts without their helmets during a training exercise at the Kennedy Space Center, has been shared repeatedly on social media over the years.\n\n\"They said, 'This is them faking the moon landing, and it's proof,'\" he recalled. \"And they will do the same thing with clips from this movie. They'll do whatever it takes to say, 'This proves what we've said all along.'\"\n\nFor people who don't have strong memories of watching the moon landing, that influence can be strong. In a 2021 national survey, Hamilton found that only 12 percent of respondents believed that the moon landings were faked, but that millennials were more likely than other generations to deny it happened.\n\nGen Z-ers were more likely to be unsure if it happened. A recent TikTok filter asking users to rank things on a scale of one to 10 based on how much they believe in them, with one being more likely and 10 being less likely, inspired multiple videos with people placing the moon landing below things like God, magic and ghosts. But a few popular videos doesn't mean Gen-Zers are flocking to moon landing conspiracies en masse, as the survey shows.\n\nOne person who isn't worried about the movie unintentionally bolstering conspiracy beliefs: Anna Garcia, the actress who plays Ruby, an assistant to Johansson's character.\n\n\"I think if someone's really dumb, they'll definitely get that message,\" Garcia told Variety at the movie's premiere. \"I think if someone is sort of dumb as rocks, they'll be like, 'It was fake.'\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fly Me to the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hoax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Kubrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rochester", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Rochester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nihilism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physicist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of New Hampshire"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Science_in_Society/Skeptical_Inquiry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Science in Society/Skeptical Inquiry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/UFOs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/UFOs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Will-a-Movie-Faking-the-Moon-Landing-Propel-a-Debunked.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746407", "eventUri": "eng-9746407", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

A fictional romantic comedy set against a sometimes accurate but often not retelling of the Apollo 11 moon landing, the film is loosely based on NASA's real efforts to sell the moon missions to the American public and the world.\n\n\"In reality, it was a team of marketers and they were all men. In our case, it is one person and she's a woman,\" said Greg Berlanti, director of \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" in an interview with collectSPACE. \"I was born in '72 and I grew up knowing Tang and Omega watches and how associated they were with the program. There were so many products at that time that we still associate with the astronauts.\"\n\nLike most of the movie, which seamlessly blends the real and the fake, \"Fly Me to the Moon\" features products that were actually on board Apollo 11 and others that had no link to the space program at all. The mix, perhaps inadvertently, underscores an exchange between Jones (Johansson) and Cole Davis (Channing Tatum), NASA's launch director (in the movie; the actual Apollo 11 launch director was Rocco Petrone).\n\n\"We don't have to send any of this stuff into space so long as we say it went,\" says Jones.\n\n\"Oh, so you're going to lie,\" replies Davis.\n\n\"It's called selling. We're not lying to the customer. We're changing the way they think,\" Jones says.\n\n\"There's a scene that has all of Kelly's ads when she starts selling and bringing them all together. Some of them were based on actual materials that we saw and that we were able to refine and others were ones that, like Rice Krispies, that we added our own \"Snap, Crackle and Pop\" fun to,\" said Berlanti. \"I kept waiting for someone to say, 'Oh, we're not allowed to use that,' but everyone was cool with it.\"\n\nThe first layout that Jones unveils is for Omega, the Swiss watchmaker. \"Built like a space capsule... the Omega Chronograph times Astronauts in space,\" reads the enlarged ad.\n\nThe design, which includes a NASA photo of first U.S. spacewalker Ed White and a close-up of the Omega Speedmaster Professional looks like it came straight out of a magazine -- and that is because it did. The exact advertisement ran in periodicals and newspapers in 1968 (all the way down to the fine print promoting the Olympic Games in Mexico airing on the ABC Television Network that October).\n\nLike all of the products that were advertised for having an association with the space program, NASA did not select the Speedmaster as a way to win the hearts and minds of watch enthusiasts, but rather because it was the only model capable of passing its tests to ensure it would reliably work in space and on the moon. The bragging rights were a bonus (almost every Speedmaster that Omega has sold since has been inscribed with \"The first watch worn on the moon.\").\n\nJones' next ad is for Crest, \"the only brand trusteed by Astronauts.\" Only it wasn't. Due to the lack of a water basin or other means of rinsing out their mouths after brushing, the astronauts used an editable (i.e. swallowable) toothpaste developed by NASA.\n\nConversely, Tang was famously consumed by the space agency's crew members (though, contrary to a widely-spread myth, the General Foods' powdered drink mix was not invented for NASA but rather was an off-the-shelf solution for the metallic tasting water on early American spacecraft).\n\nThe Tang ad that Jones shows Davis was created for the movie (using a modified image of an astronaut reclining on the moon; the original art has the spaceman holding up a smart phone). It is based, however, on the a real Tang promotion, which used a NASA photo of Earth from the moon and a 12-cent store coupon \"for Earth people only.\"\n\nJones reads out, \"the energy breakfast drink chosen for Apollo astronauts on their trip to the moon.\" A similar tagline appeared in the real ad, \"The energy breakfast drink of earth. Chosen for Apollo astronauts in outer space.\"\n\nThe fourth and final ad in the scene is Jones' favorite, Fruit of the Loom. \"Your guys gotta wear something under those big [space]suits, don't they?\" she asks rhetorically. This idea did not fly, at least not in real life. The ad feature a 2020 stock photo of a boy wearing a homemade rocket pack with the made-up-for-the-movie text, \"Comfort that will take you new places.\"\n\nHad the \"Fly Me to the Moon\" filmmakers only wanted to use items that actually advertised their role on Apollo, they could have chosen from Sony tape recorders, Stouffer's prepared foods or RCA cameras, among others, as documented in the book, \"Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program\" by David Meerman Scott and Richard Jurek (2014, MIT Press).\n\nOther fictional product ads seen in the film include the aforementioned Kellogg's Rice Krispies and Peter Pan peanut butter.\n\nBeyond the commercial layouts, \"Fly Me to the Moon\" also includes other ways that NASA worked to sell the Apollo program to the public, including arranging for a contract with LIFE magazine to share the astronauts' personal stories. NASA also held regular press conferences, as depicted in the film, although the idea put forth by Jones to get the engineers and astronauts out from behind a desk did not come until much later in the agency's history.\n\nA scene also shows the three Apollo 11 astronauts driving Corvettes. While the space agency was not keen on Chevrolet just giving away its cars, a local dealer, Jim Rathman, offered to lease brand new Corvettes and other cars to the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo astronauts for just one dollar per year. When the cars were returned, Rathman sold them to the public, now having added the provenance that they had been driven by the astronauts.\n\n\"One of my favorite aspects of American history is that it is really filled with two types of characters that drive it,\" said Berlanti, who minored in American history in college. \"One are these sort of dreamers who are like, 'We're going to do that!' and then there are all the hard-working, practical people who actually then make that dream a reality.\"\n\n\"When Kennedy said at the beginning of that decade that we're going to go to the moon, there was no evidence that that could ever happen, right?\" he said. \"So we reflect on that in the movie, and I love that Scarlett's character and Tatum's character are the two sides of that. Kelly is the type of person who makes a bunch of stuff up and is always trying to sell people something and Cole is one those individuals who makes what she's selling a reality. But it takes both types for the moon landing to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_z_pearlman@space.com", "name": "Robert Z.

Houston's Johnson Space Center, home to Mission Control, is also getting into the act. Four days after they left Earth, Armstrong and Aldrin, in their lunar module, Eagle, settled onto the Sea of Tranquility at 4:17 p.m. Eastern with barely any fuel remaining. \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,\" Armstrong radioed from 240,000 miles (386,000 kilometers) away. \"No moment united the country quite like when the Eagle landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday in an anniversary message.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n'One small step'\n\n\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong proclaimed as he became the first person to step on the moon. Armstrong grew up in northwestern Ohio's Wapakoneta, now home to the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. The museum's tribute Saturday begins with a pair of \"Run to the Moon\" races. followed by model rocket launches and wind tunnel demos. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, hailed from New Concord on the opposite side of the state, some 150 miles (240 kilometers) away. The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be open there Saturday for your astronaut fix.\n\n'Magnificent desolation'\n\nAldrin followed Armstrong outside on the moon, uttering \"Magnificent desolation.\" They spent just over two hours treading the dusty surface, before returning to their lunar module and blasting off to link back up with Collins, the command module pilot who had remained in lunar orbit. Armstrong's spacesuit for the moonshot was restored in time for the 50th anniversary in 2019. It's on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, along with their return capsule. Aldrin and Collins' spacesuits from Apollo 11 are also part of the Smithsonian collection and currently in storage. Collins died in 2021, less than a year after the 50th anniversary; Armstrong died in 2012.\n\nSplashdown!\n\nThe capsule holding Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins -- dubbed Columbia -- splashed down in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. They were recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier that repeated the job for Apollo 12 four months later. The Hornet is now part of a museum in Alameda, California, with a splashdown party planned aboard the ship on Saturday. Some of the original recovery crew will be there. The Apollo 11 astronauts immediately went into quarantine aboard the Hornet and, along with 48 pounds (22 kilograms) of moon rocks and soil, remained off-limits for weeks as they were moved to Houston. Scientists feared the astronauts might have brought back moon germs. Most of the rocks remain locked up inside a restricted lab at Houston's Johnson Space Center. The Apollo program landed 12 astronauts on the moon from 1969 through 1972.\n\nNext up: Apollo's twin\n\nNASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year -- part of a new moon program named Artemis after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology. The SLS rocket for that flyaround -- short for Space Launch System -- is due at Kennedy Space Center next week. It's arriving by barge from NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This core stage will get a pair of strap-on boosters at Kennedy before blasting off in September 2025 -- at the earliest -- with three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian. None of them will land on the moon; that will come on a following mission with another crew no earlier than 2026.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Even those who weren't alive at the time have no doubt seen the video of Neil Armstrong declaring, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" as he steps off the Apollo 11 spacecraft onto the surface of the Moon. Take Me to the Moon is based on the Apollo 11 Moon Landing, the marketing of the endeavor to the American public, and all the wild theories surrounding its veracity.\n\nScreenwriter Rose Gilroy uses as background the book Marketing the Moon, about the real advertising, genre books and movies that were used to \"sell\" the Apollo 11 Moon Landing project to the American people. Her story centers on a marketing maven played by Scarlet Johansson, who is brought to NASA to help capture the hearts of the public. She must convince an uptight ex-pilot, now uber-focused project director, played by Channing Tatum, that this marketing of the endeavor is vital. To add difficulty to her assignment, it has been decided that the moon landing cannot fail in the public's eyes, so she must oversee the filming of an alternative successful landing on a sound stage that must be perfectly timed to the real event, just in case. This part of the story is based on a mockumentary called Dark Side of the Moon, that sees NASA recruiting Stanley Kubrick to be advisor to a fallback film being made in case the actual launch failed.\n\nI have my own opinion about the truth of the Moon Landing because I met Buzz Aldrin in the 1970's. He used to sometimes attend my dad's parties in Marina del Rey, which were known for free-flowing laughter, dancing, stories, and plenty of alcohol. Aldrin was one of the most animated of guests and loved to tell stories. Years later, around 2005-2010, I met Aldrin a couple of times at events. I asked him if he remembered Dad's parties. He said that, thankfully, his wife, Lois, had helped him stop drinking many years ago and that he did not remember much from the time before that. My point is that if Aldrin had the propensity to expound about his adventures at alcohol-fueled parties in the 1970s, and if the landing had never happened, he would have admitted that. I have also been to lectures that he's given on the details of the Apollo 11 mission. A brilliant, highly educated mathematician and engineer, he had to calculate angles in real-time as the module was landing in order not to crash into the moon. He's totally believable. Aldrin has written several books and many articles promoting space travel. In December 2023, Aldrin, now 94, was at Culver City Costco signing his newest book, Magnificent Desolation. The title of the book is taken from his comment upon his first step onto the lunar surface.\n\nFly Me to the Moon is a fun rom-com featuring Johansson and Tatum. Johansson lights up the room. Tatum skillfully plays a frustrated ex-pilot who wishes he could be in the module but can't be due to a heart defect. His character is based on Duke Slayton, a WWII pilot who joined the NASA astronaut program but was found to have atrial fibrillation. Slayton became Director of Flight Crew Operations for the Apollo program.\n\nRe-living the moon landing and seeing some of the original footage is beautiful, as are some of the spectacular new launch sequences shot on 4K cameras. The immense uncertainty and danger, and the courage of the astronauts of the Apollo 11 Mission are front and center. The underlying theme is truth and lies and the fine line between them.\n\nKathryn Whitney Boole has spent most of her life in the entertainment industry, which has been the backdrop for remarkable adventures with extraordinary people.

The space agency will mark the occasion with a events both in-person and online, between Monday, July 15, and Thursday, July 25.\n\nThe mission to the moon was believed to be \"impossible\" at the time, with much doubt cast over the rocket, equipment, and astronauts' abilities.\n\nSince the Apollo 11 astronauts stepped onto the surface, there have been just 10 to follow in their footsteps.\n\nIf you fancy learning more, Apollo 10 \u00bd is now streaming on Netflix -- a semi-autobiographical animation by Richard Linklater, which explores growing up in the 1960s, with humankind on the verge of landing on the moon.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the moon landing, including when it was and the conspiracy theories surrounding it.\n\nWhen did Apollo 11 land on the moon and what happened?\n\nOn Monday, July 21, 1969, at 3.56am (GMT), Neil Armstrong stepped on to the surface of the moon for the very first time. However, the Lunar Module landed on the moon several hours prior, at 9.17pm on Sunday, July 20, 1969.\n\nIt was a feat that had been planned for years prior to the mission, down to the minute, but still saw the astronauts face a host of obstacles along the way until they eventually landed successfully.\n\nThe team aboard Apollo 11 remained in constant contact with Mission control and the command module.\n\nJust minutes before landing, at 9.10pm, a '1202 programme alarm' was triggered four times. The mission continued despite the risks and the Eagle Lunar module landed safely.\n\nIt was then that the famous words \"the Eagle has landed\" were uttered by Armstrong.\n\nWhile he stepped out onto the moon's surface at 2.56am, it wasn't until 3.15am that Buzz Aldrin followed suit, with the pair reportedly spending two hours outside on the moon.\n\nThey were believed to have taken photographs and collected 21.5kg of lunar material for testing back on Earth. The video recording was transmitted back to Mission Control, with around 530 million watching the moment on television.\n\nWho was on the Apollo 11 mission?\n\nThe three crew members of the Apollo 11 mission were Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin.\n\nArmstrong was the astronaut behind the \"One small step for man\" quote, while Aldrin captured the photo of the space boot imprint on the moon -- as part of a study of the nature of the soil on its surface.\n\nHow long did it take Apollo 11 to reach the moon and when did the astronauts return to Earth?\n\nIt took Apollo 11 and its astronauts four days, six hours, and 45 minutes to reach the moon.\n\nThe mission initially aimed to send a three-person crew to orbit the moon, rather than landing on the surface.\n\nHowever, due to the Space Race with Russia, President John F Kennedy announced the goal of landing an American on the moon's surface, causing Apollo 11's mission to change.\n\nThe astronauts scraped making it to the moon's surface as they were 23 seconds away from fuel levels being too low to complete the mission.\n\nIt wasn't until July 24, 1969, that the astronauts returned back to Earth, with the Eagle beginning its ascent back to the command module on July 21, 1969, before docking and rejoining Apollo 11.\n\nOn July 22, 1969, Apollo 11 began its journey back to Earth, before safely landing in the Pacific Ocean just two days later.\n\nWhat conspiracy theories are there surrounding the moon landing?\n\nThousands of people around the world believe that the moon landings were faked and that the Apollo 11 mission never happened.\n\nThese conspiracy theories have been debunked many times, with evidence and scientific explanations.\n\nSome believe the shadows in the moon landing photos prove the images were faked, but this has been disproved with simple explanations surrounding how shadows and photography work.\n\nAnother theory claims the lack of stars in the photos means they couldn't have possibly been on the moon, but the Royal Museums Greenwich website states why this is the case.\n\nIt states: \"Here's another solution: both the astronauts and the lunar landscape itself are brightly lit by the Sun. The sky may look black, but remember, this is in fact daytime on the Moon.\n\n\"If you're going to take a photo of a brightly lit scene, your camera's shutter speed needs to be fast and your aperture incredibly small. In that situation, faint objects like stars simply aren't going to show up.\"\n\nAnd many wonder why no-one has been back to the moon since the last Apollo mission in 1972, given technology has progressed so much.

It's a movie you don't see get made anymore. It has an older tone, but it does feel modern,\" the actor said of the story.\n\n\"When I met with Greg Berlanti, the director, I thought we were going to do this very, like, pastiche sort of tone, like \"His Girl Friday\" or something like that, but he was like, 'No, definitely, I want it to be you guys and really play with it,'\" Channing said.\n\n\"His Girl Friday\" is a 1940 screwball comedy film starring Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant. It is considered among the \"best movies of the past decade.\"\n\n\"He really wanted us to improv a little as well, and that kind of made it a little bit more modern and not so rigid. It just has a really strange tone that I really loved, and set in a big, epic setting of our history in time in America,\" Channing continued, referring to \"Fly Me to the Moon.\"\n\nThe actor also opened up about his character, Cole.\n\n\"Cole was a very good pilot and he always wanted to go to the moon, that's why he came to NASA,\" he said.\n\n\"Turns out he had a medical condition that wouldn't let him go, and now he's going to take it upon himself to basically get all his friends that are pilots themselves [to the moon],\" Channing shared.\n\n\"They're very close and he's going to be responsible for coaching them to get to the moon. At the time, it was really, really bad. They were not winning this race, and he was feeling the pressure. And then a saving grace angel comes in and gets him the money that he actually needs to be able to do this, but kind of against his will,\" he added.\n\nThe movie also sees Scarlett as one of its producers, apart from being the leading lady.\n\nShe was originally going to be behind the scenes, but the script convinced her otherwise.\n\nHer character is written as a \"strong woman.\"\n\n\"I never intended on playing Kelly,\" Scarlett revealed.\n\n\"But when the script came in, it was so great. It was such a wonderful read and the dialogue was so strong. And as a woman producer, working with a woman writer, who had created a strong woman character -- well, it felt right,\" she shared.\n\nScarlett also reflected on the film's story, saying that \"it's so unusual these days\" that a movie is shown in theaters that \"has an original story and has this kind of scope.\"\n\n\"It's a big movie but the story itself is very intimate, it's like a character piece that's in this massive, huge set piece,\" the actress said.\n\n\"To me, getting to experience that in the fullest, watching it on the screen with an audience and get carried away, there's a certain kind of nostalgia, a kind of magic to that tone of film that is not common now. So being able to experience that in theaters is like a wonderful night out,\" she added.\n\n\"Fly Me to the Moon\" is now showing in cinemas.\n\nIt is distributed in the Philippines by Columbia Pictures, local office of Sony Pictures Releasing International.", "source": {"uri": "interaksyon.philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Interaksyon"}, "authors": [{"uri":

At the end of the 1960s, a wary NASA recognizes the need for better public relations during the Vietnam War. The resulting campaign leads to a faked version of the Apollo 11 mission being shot on a sound stage even as the real mission is unfolding. Shenanigans, and romance, ensue.\n\n\"Fly Me to the Moon\" isn't the first movie based on the mistaken belief that the moon landing was a hoax, a conspiracy theory that first arose in the 1970s. \"Capricorn One\" (1978), about a faked mission to Mars, taps into Watergate-era institutional distrust, and more recently, \"Moonwalkers\" (2015) pairs a C.I.A. agent with a rock band manager to fake the Apollo 11 landing.\n\nWhat sets \"Fly Me to the Moon\" apart is its insistence on the truth. The movie's writers say they hope it will reinforce the real story of the moon landing. But is that possible in a post-Covid age when conspiracy theories are amplified on social media?\n\nThe screenplay, written by Rose Gilroy and based on a story by Keenan Flynn and Bill Kirstein, plays with the theory, including a joke on some conspiracists' belief that the director Stanley Kubrick supposedly had a hand in faking the historic event. (He did not.) But ultimately the film emphasizes that the Apollo 11 landing did take place.\n\nFlynn said the initial idea for the movie came in 2016.

It was the year 1969 and the day was July 20.\n\nNeil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, who were part of NASA's Apollo 11 mission, did something huge by stepping foot on the moon. They set down at a spot they called Tranquility Base, starting a new chapter in space travel.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) decided to celebrate International Moon Day every year on July 20, after passing a resolution 76/76 about working together peacefully in outer space in 2021.\n\nThe Moon\n\nThe Moon is super easy to spot in the sky. Being so close to us, it's really important in our culture and also has a big part in causing the tides on Earth. The Moon is about a quarter the size of Earth, with a 10,917 km diameter around its equator and a 1,737 km radius. The Moon has almost no air, so it can't hold onto heat or keep the ground warm. The Moon is about 384,400 kilometers away from Earth, so it would take more than 17 days without stopping to reach it on a plane.\n\nThe Moon's gravity pulls water towards it, making the side closest to it bulge and creating a high tide. This also happens on the opposite side of Earth because of the combined effect of the Moon's and Earth's gravity. This stretching and squishing of Earth causes water to bulge on both sides, leading to two high tides and two low tides every day.\n\nHow many times have people landed on the Moon?\n\nSo far, NASA has sent six people to the Moon, all through its Apollo program from 1961 to 1972.\n\nAfter the big deal of Apollo 11, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969, the US sent out five more missions up until 1972. A total of twelve folks have actually walked on the Moon's surface.\n\nSince then, no one's been back, but NASA is gearing up to send humans back to the Moon with the Artemis III mission in 2025.\n\nIndia On The Moon\n\nOn July 14, 2023 Chandrayaan-3 mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh's Sriharikota.\n\nIndia has achieved the distinction of being the first country to land a spacecraft successfully on the moon's south pole. India's Chandrayaan-3 mission successfully landed near the moon's south pole on August 23, 2023. Odysseus landed in Malapert A, a crater just 300 kilometers away from the Moon's South Pole.\n\nCountries that Landed On Moon:\n\nThe Soviet Union: The Soviet Union's Luna 9 was the first to land softly on the moon in 1966.\n\nU.S.: In 1969, NASA's Apollo 11 mission, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, was the most important event in the space race, with 12 astronauts landing on the moon over six missions.\n\nChina: China landed its first rover, Yutu, on the moon in 2013 and its second rover, Yutu-2, on the moon's far side in 2019, which was a big deal.\n\nRussia: Russia brought back moon rocks from the moon in 1976.\n\nIndia: India's Chandrayaan-3 mission in 2023 successfully landed on the moon, making India the fourth country to do so.\n\nJapan: Japan landed its first rover on the moon in January, but it landed on the wrong side, which made it harder to use its solar panels.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors":

It's called the buck moon because male deer, or bucks, fully grow their antlers at this time of year, the almanac says.\n\nBut since the moon appears full for a few days a month surrounding its peak, the best time to view it might be on Saturday to mark the 55th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing, the first space mission to bring humans to the moon, said Noah Petro, chief of NASA's Planetary Geology, Geophysics and Geochemistry Laboratory.\n\n\"The first moon landing was in the afternoon on (July 20, 1969), and then they did the moonwalk that night,\" Petro said. \"There's no better way to celebrate that than by going outside and looking at the full moon and toasting Neil (Armstrong), Buzz (Aldrin) and Michael Collins, and all the people who helped make Apollo 11 a reality 55 years ago.\"\n\nHow to view the full moon\n\nLocal weather conditions allowing, the full moon will be visible to those in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, Petro said. For optimal moon gazing, he recommends finding a spot with a clear view of the sky, away from tall buildings and trees. Even in cities with a lot of light pollution, the moon will be visible in a clear night sky.\n\nNo equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features -- the dark areas that can be observed on the moon are \"vast volcanic lava flows that are billions of years old,\" Petro said.\n\n\"Even with the naked eye ... you can start seeing the history of the moon in front of you. And that's one of the reasons why I love studying the moon -- is that it's laid bare for folks to see,\" he added. \"On a beautiful full moon clear night, you can see differences in colour, you can see differences on the surface that all go back to the history of the moon.\"\n\nTo the average observer, the buck moon will look like almost every other full moon, Petro said. But each full moon varies month to month, due to its slightly shifting orientation, known as libration, and the changing distance from Earth in its elliptical orbit. To observe the different perspectives, Petro recommends taking a photo of each lunar event as it occurs and then compare it with the next one.\n\nAnd for those looking to catch a glimpse of other celestial bodies, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter and Uranus can also be observed in early morning hours during July, according to NASA's monthly sky-watching highlights video.\n\nLunar discoveries\n\nNASA's Artemis program aims to return astronauts to the moon for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972. The space agency plans to establish the first lunar outpost and further explore the moon, contributing to new discoveries about our nearest celestial neighbour.\n\nRecently, scientists confirmed the first direct evidence of a cave on the moon using radar data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been collecting data since its launch in June 2009. Researchers discovered the cave connected to a pit found within a vast plain called Mare Tranquillitatis, or the Sea of Tranquility, the same region where Apollo 11 astronauts landed in 1969.\n\n\"When we went to the moon 55 years ago, we knew very little about it -- we didn't know how old it was, how it formed, the processes that have changed it over its life,\" said Petro, who is also the project scientist for both the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Artemis III.\n\n\"Every time we learned something new about the moon, whether it's about caves on the lunar surface or samples that are returned ... we also realize how little we (still) know about the moon.\"\n\nDiscoveries about the moon help us better understand other planets, Petro added.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nJuly's full moon will shine bright in the sky this weekend -- and lands near the anniversary of a special lunar event worth celebrating.\n\nThe full moon -- nicknamed the buck moon -- will peak at 6:17 a.m. ET Sunday, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac. It's called the buck moon because male deer, or bucks, fully grow their antlers at this time of year, the almanac says.\n\nBut since the moon appears full for a few days a month surrounding its peak, the best time to view it might be on Saturday to mark the 55th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing, the first space mission to bring humans to the moon, said Noah Petro, chief of NASA's Planetary Geology, Geophysics and Geochemistry Laboratory.\n\n\"The first moon landing was in the afternoon on (July 20, 1969), and then they did the moonwalk that night,\" Petro said. \"There's no better way to celebrate that than by going outside and looking at the full moon and toasting Neil (Armstrong), Buzz (Aldrin) and Michael Collins, and all the people who helped make Apollo 11 a reality 55 years ago.\"\n\nHow to view the full moon\n\nLocal weather conditions allowing, the full moon will be visible to those in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, Petro said. For optimal moon gazing, he recommends finding a spot with a clear view of the sky, away from tall buildings and trees. Even in cities with a lot of light pollution, the moon will be visible in a clear night sky.\n\nNo equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features -- the dark areas that can be observed on the moon are \"vast volcanic lava flows that are billions of years old,\" Petro said.\n\n\"Even with the naked eye ... you can start seeing the history of the moon in front of you. And that's one of the reasons why I love studying the moon -- is that it's laid bare for folks to see,\" he added. \"On a beautiful full moon clear night, you can see differences in color, you can see differences on the surface that all go back to the history of the moon.\"\n\nTo the average observer, the buck moon will look like almost every other full moon, Petro said. But each full moon varies month to month, due to its slightly shifting orientation, known as libration, and the changing distance from Earth in its elliptical orbit. To observe the different perspectives, Petro recommends taking a photo of each lunar event as it occurs and then compare it with the next one.\n\nAnd for those looking to catch a glimpse of other celestial bodies, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter and Uranus can also be observed in early morning hours during July, according to NASA's monthly sky-watching highlights video.\n\nLunar discoveries\n\nNASA's Artemis program aims to return astronauts to the moon for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972. The space agency plans to establish the first lunar outpost and further explore the moon, contributing to new discoveries about our nearest celestial neighbor.\n\nRecently, scientists confirmed the first direct evidence of a cave on the moon using radar data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been collecting data since its launch in June 2009. Researchers discovered the cave connected to a pit found within a vast plain called Mare Tranquillitatis, or the Sea of Tranquility, the same region where Apollo 11 astronauts landed in 1969.\n\n\"When we went to the moon 55 years ago, we knew very little about it -- we didn't know how old it was, how it formed, the processes that have changed it over its life,\" said Petro, who is also the project scientist for both the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Artemis III.\n\n\"Every time we learned something new about the moon, whether it's about caves on the lunar surface or samples that are returned ... we also realize how little we (still) know about the moon.\"\n\nDiscoveries about the moon help us better understand other planets, Petro added.

What's that all about? Why is our space technology going backwards?\" Stein asks Buhler.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is there's a couple of reasons for it. You know, 50 years ago, NASA had 10% of the federal budget. Now, we have less than 1% of the federal budget,\" Buhler explains.\n\nHe also blames the lack of serious competition.\n\n\"We don't have a conventional space race like we did against the Russians in the 1960s,\" he says. \"Now, we're relying on companies to do it. NASA is funding a lot of companies to do the space race now, so that's pretty exciting, if you're a space enthusiast.\"\n\nAccording to Buhler, Artemis II is a spacecraft that will be sent to orbit the moon with astronauts as early as next year.\n\n\"Charles, they always say next year we're going to send a man to the moon, next year, man on the moon -- they've been saying that for 50 years,\" Stein counters.\n\nWhen Stein presses Buhler on whether or not the moon landing was faked and if so, why, Charles answers that \"obviously\" it wasn't faked.\n\nHe cites moon rocks that he has in his lab at NASA as proof of the moon landing being real -- but Stein was ready for that one, referencing the moon rock given to a Dutch museum by Neil Armstrong.\n\nThe rock was later found to be fake and made of petrified wood.\n\n\"And isn't there moon rocks in Antarctica supposedly?\" Stein asks, adding, \"So isn't it possible to get moon rocks on Earth?\"\n\n\"It is, it truly is,\" Buhler says. \"We get Mars rocks too on Earth, whenever there's a meteor collision. That's possible.\"\n\nWant more from Alex Stein?\n\nTo enjoy more of Alex's culture jamming, comedic monologues, skits, and street segments, subscribe to BlazeTV -- the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo Lunar Module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_space_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outline of space technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blaze Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culture jamming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrified_wood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petrified wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Science_in_Society/Skeptical_Inquiry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Science in Society/Skeptical Inquiry", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Beer_Steins_and_Glasses", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Beer Steins and Glasses", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Anomalous_Objects", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Anomalous Objects", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52951743&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C120", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746407", "eventUri": "eng-9746407", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 10}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

And no moment united the country quite like when the Eagle [spacecraft] landed, as all of planet Earth watched from below,\" said Nelson, who at age 81 was in his mid-20s when the landing took place.\n\nRelated: For Henry Kissinger, NASA'S Apollo 11 lunar landing was about more than the moon\n\nThe year 2024 will conclude the latest federal election campaign in the United States. The non-partisan Pew Research Center has noted several unique features of the campaign between Republican nominee Donald Trump (also the former president between 2017 and 2021) and current President Joe Biden, a Democrat elected to the Oval Office in 2020.\n\nPew's research suggests a number of fissions among voters. There are disputes, for example, about whether Trump broke the law during his time in office due to his role in an attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Biden's mental and physical fitness for office is also a common topic of debate. Overall, there exists a lack of confidence in both leaders, with Pew tracking \"large divides in voters' candidate preference by age, education, and race and ethnicity.\"\n\nOn Saturday (July 13), Trump was injured by gunfire during an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. An investigation into the attempt is complex and at an early stage.\n\nNelson is a former Democratic senator and long-time politician of space matters; he also flew on the space shuttle with NASA in 1986 while part of a space committee. Biden appointed Nelson to the position of NASA administrator in 2021.\n\nRelated: NASA chief Bill Nelson brings a politician's eye to space agency\n\nSaying this year has \"politically divided times\" as well as \"unacceptable political violence,\" Nelson asked for the anniversary of Apollo 11 to \"be a time of reflection and, I hope, of healing\" as NASA aims to put boots on the moon again as soon as 2026 with moon-landing mission Artemis 3.\n\n\"Some may say that our brightest days are behind us,\" added Nelson. \"But what will happen when humanity gathers once again, in shared reverence, to watch a crew of Artemis astronauts take to the heavens -- and then when humanity sets foot, once again, on the surface of the moon? The day will be a triumph for all.\"\n\nNelson also alluded to the Artemis Accords, in which dozens of nations are committing to peaceful exploration norms led by NASA with a subset participating directly in moon exploration under the agreement. \"When we can work together up there, we can live together down here -- in the name of peace,\" he said.\n\nThe other major world groups aiming for human moon landings are Russia and China; both have been called out repeatedly in Congress and by the Pentagon in recent years for security concerns.\n\nHow the 2020s will measure up to the 1960s in future years is still in question, although incidents like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Jan. 6 event and the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022 already have had deep implications on U.S. policy. In fact, numerous sources also point to the mid-twentieth century as being a moment of American protest and politics that still has repercussions today.\n\n\"The divisions over the Vietnam War and certainly the divisions over segregation were really, really powerful,\" Pulitzer-Prize winning author and historian Taylor Branch, who studies the civil rights movement, told NPR in 2022.\n\n\"Those things ripped the country and families apart back then,\" he added. \"We've always had extremely divisive issues. Right now, I think what we lack is a more coherent, positive alternative.\"", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

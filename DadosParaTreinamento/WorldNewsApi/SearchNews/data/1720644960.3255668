{"id": 231320762, "title": "Canadian Tycoon Frank Stronach Arrested in Sex Assault Case", "text": "Belinda Stronach claimed in court filings that her father had drained $580 million from the family fortune through a series of often unprofitable projects, while he in turn accused her of lavish spending on the company\u2019s tab and financial mismanagement. The settlement, announced in August, 2020, saw Frank Stronach take full ownership of a thoroughbred stallion and breeding business, including Stronach Stables, and farming operations in Florida, Kentucky and Ontario. He no longer has any interest in Stronach Group. Almost a decade earlier, Stronach launched a political campaign in his native Austria, pledging to drop the euro and slash both spending and taxes. He won a seat but his party took less than 6% of the vote in a 2013 election and he quit politics the following year. Stronach has had no affiliation with Magna since giving up control in 2010, Tracy Fuerst, a spokesperson for the company said by email. \u201cMagna has no knowledge of the investigation or the allegations that have been raised beyond what has been reported in the media.\u201d The Stronach Group similarly said in a statement that the businessman \u201chas not held a formal role or been involved with company operations in any capacity for several years.\u201d Both Magna and the Stronach Group said they had no further comment with the matter now before the courts. Stronach was inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame in 1996 and has recently been writing a weekly column for Canada\u2019s National Post newspaper. The column has been suspended pending the outcome of the charges, the Post\u2019s editor-in-chief Rob Roberts said, according to a story published by the paper.

The reduction wouldn't impact the city's other aquatic facilities.\n\nAssistant park and recreation director John Lawrence said reducing the days of operation would save the city about $200,000 -- but likely more, as swimming lessons would be reduced by 40%.\n\n\"We've also had several seasons where we've closed the pools because we didn't have adequate staffing and we reduced the similar number of hours to about three days a week,\" Lawrence said. \"We're evaluating that to determine what did that impact have and have a better idea of our budget implications going forward.\"\n\nAt a meeting Monday of the committee on Parks, Trails and the Environment, council member Chad West said he wants to make sure the park and recreation department is making cuts in other areas before the community pools.\n\n\"This is one of the very last places I can imagine actually trying to find cuts,\" West said. \"I know that there's quite a few pools in the southern sector, and I don't want to just limit to that. These community pools really service the part of the community that doesn't have access to pools otherwise.\"\n\nThe proposal to close pools came after the city requested budget cuts across all departments to close a $38 million budget shortfall. Park officials said the pools never saw more than 70 visitors daily last year.\n\nPark and Recreation director John Jenkins said the pools are outdated and inefficient, and recommended residents visit the aquatic centers instead.\n\n\"I can't think of one year in the last 10 years that community pools remain open throughout the year without having some of them go down,\" Jenkins said.\n\nHe added closing pools had been up for discussion since before budget cuts.\n\n\"It was the policy decision that...as we open the new aquatics facilities, the community pools would close,\" Jenkins said. \"But since it hasn't happened...we need to make a decision what we want to do with these community pools now.\"\n\nCouncil member Jesse Moreno said it's important to reevaluate how the pools can better serve the community if they remain open.\n\n\"Just a few years ago, this department invested heavily in modernizing and getting new aquatic centers throughout the city of Dallas,\" Moreno said. \"After that master plan was implemented, I would say we will now come back and reevaluate those community pools.\"\n\nMoreno said details like days of operation, daily attendance and operating costs need to be compiled to help plan the future of the pools.\n\n\"This is obviously a very unpopular conversation to have, both at the council and the residents' level,\" Moreno said. \"So, I do want to make sure that we have a very in-depth community engagement and input.\"\n\nThe city manager is scheduled to present the proposed budget on Aug. 13.\n\nPenelope Rivera is KERA's news intern.

It sounds great, but there are issues around that.\"\n\nThe report that went to the committee said: \"There are stringent health and safety measures in place regarding the operation of swimming pools relating to supervision levels, storage and use of chemicals, water temperature, security, etc.\n\n\"It is incumbent on local authorities, head teachers and school staff to ensure these measures are in place relating to any temporary pool structures.\n\n\"Further national guidance from Swim England and Sport England is expected soon, which is expected to clarify the issues relating to pop-up pools and, in the meantime, local guidance is being distributed to all schools by the local authorities.\n\n\"It would not be possible to meet national curriculum standards in temporary pools due to their length, depth and the inability to jump in and climb out of the pool (without steps) in line with the water safety standards.\"\n\nMr Harrison pointed out that Swim England, the Swimming Teachers' Association and Swim Wales recently put out a statement saying they did not endorse the use of pop-up pools.\n\nTracy Brabin said the issues around pop-up pools were \"worrying\" and something the Authority would need to look at further.\n\nCouncillor Jeanette Sunderland (Lib Dem, Idle and Thackley) has written to Bradford Council bosses urging the authority to investigate banning the use of above-ground and temporary pools for the use by the district's schools for swimming lessons.\n\nShe has cited water hygiene concerns, as well as arguing that the heating of such pools raises environmental issues and that pupils do not get the full pool experience from using such pools.\n\nShe fears an ongoing review of leisure facilities in Bradford, likely to lead to pool closures, could see even more schools looking to pop up pools for school swimming lessons.", "source": {"uri": "thetelegraphandargus.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Telegraph and Argus"},

Departments were asked to find ways to reduce their budgets by 6%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Park Department Director John Jenkins presented cuts that would also reduce the city's contribution to its public-private partnerships like the Dallas Zoo and Trinity River Audubon Center, some Park Board members, who oversee the department, said pool closures could negatively impact communities in the city's southern half as the majority of pools lie south of I-30.\n\nPolitical Points\n\nGet the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nAll the pools, however, are decades old and hard to maintain, Jenkins said.\n\n\"I can't think of one year in the last 10 years that a community pool remained open throughout the year without having some of them go down,\" Jenkins said Monday during a Park, Trails and Environment committee meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city adopted an aquatic master plan in 2015 to modernize its facilities.\n\nCouncil member Jesse Moreno, a former Park Board member, said the board at the time said it would circle back to reevaluate the pools. \"I think that's where we are today,\" Moreno said, adding that the council needed community input to delineate needs.\n\nOfficials will consider if there is room for a new spray park, a new aquatic facility or if it can partner with nearby colleges and the Dallas Independent School District to use existing facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCouncil members wanted to determine whether the shorter hours would be phased out and see a future bond investment in pools. Jenkins said he was looking for private dollars to revive pools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe department, Jenkins said, hoped to use bond funds from the recent package to replace all the community pools. That wasn't possible after the final bond allocation of $345 million -- the second-highest share of the pie but less than the department requested.\n\nTwo new pools will get bond dollars: A new facility to replace the current Jaycee Zaragoza pool in West Dallas and a new pool at Singing Hills in southern Dallas.\n\n\"We can continue to pour money and have record-breaking bond packages, but we can also continue to allow our assets to crumble in front of our eyes,\" deputy mayor pro tem Adam Bazaldua said.\n\nAdvertisementRelated StoriesView MoreOfficials say permitting errors led to non-compliant construction in Elm Thicket-NorthparkLetters to the Editor -- Dallas budget, Sen.

And Alicante is the province where you can find the most swimming pools where you can do this, because it is one of the provinces with the most swimming pools. These leisure facilities continue to grow and in 2024 there is one for every 15 Alicante residents registered. In just one year, 1,722 more swimming pools have been registered.\n\nThis is shown in the annual data provided by the General Directorate. According to these figures, in 2023 there were 127,478 open-air swimming pools in the province of Alicante; in 2024 the number has grown to 129,200, a number that could continue to grow in the coming years. Indeed, there are probably more because of the many that have not yet been officially registered.\n\nSwimming pools have become almost indispensable in these increasingly hot summers, both on the coast and inland, where many prefer to take a dip in fresh water rather than salt water. Summer arrives and in buildings, housing estates and homes there is no time of day when the pools are not being used; and having a villa is synonymous with friends and family joining with you to spend the day.\n\nIn the province, of the 129,200 registered pools, the \"top 5\" towns are X\u00e0bia (9,199); Elche (8,371); Orihuela (7,354); D\u00e9nia (5,074) and Alicante city (4,823), with Teulada (4,814), Torrevieja (4,800), Rojales (4,793), Calp (4,692) and Benissa (4,078) not far behind.\n\nThe municipality of Marina Alta is the one with the most swimming pools per inhabitant. With 29,760 registered residents there is one swimming pool for every 3.23 people. In Orihuela (83,449 registered) it is one for every 11.3 inhabitants.\n\nHowever, it is also important that those households that have a pool are able to fill them with water, a commodity that is in especially short supply across much of the province at the moment. In the Marina Alta, eight towns have been forced to take measures due to drought and lack of water. The last of them, Teulada Moraira, has been left without drinking water. This is followed by Poble Nou de Benitatxell, el Verger, Benissa, Parcent, Lliber, Xal\u00f3 and Alcalal\u00ed. These last six have restrictions on filling swimming pools and watering gardens.\n\nBetween the eight municipalities, in 2024 there are more than 12,300 swimming pools. According to some sources, a medium-sized swimming pool, about eight metres by four metres, needs an average of 48,000 litres of water. Unfortunately, for many, with not all of them have been able to be filled this summer.", "source": {"uri": "theleader.info", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Leader Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicante", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alicante"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alicante"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Alicante", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Province of Alicante"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Province of Alicante"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Alta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marina Alta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teulada,_Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teulada, Spain"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Teulada, Spain"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X\u00e0bia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X\u00e0bia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "X\u00e0bia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benissa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benissa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Benissa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calp", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00e9nia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D\u00e9nia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00e9nia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elche", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elche"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Elche"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orihuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orihuela"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orihuela"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rojales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rojales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrevieja", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torrevieja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Torrevieja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipalities of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcalal\u00ed", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcalal\u00ed"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alcalal\u00ed"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jal\u00f3n", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jal\u00f3n"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jal\u00f3n"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moraira", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moraira"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moraira"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcent", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parcent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Parcent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Swimming_Pools_and_Spas", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Swimming Pools and Spas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://j6n3r3q2.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Aldeas-de-Aguamarina-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795721", "eventUri": "eng-9795721", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Officials said the owners also did not have permission to use their pools for commercial purposes.\n\nThe need for lifeguards has assumed renewed importance after the death of a five-year-old boy in a swimming pool in a condominium in Gurgaon last month.\n\nAlthough two lifeguards were stationed nearby, they were too engrossed in their phones to realise that the boy had shifted to the adult section of the pool, which was more than 4ft deep.\n\nEven when the boy struggled to stay afloat, the two guards failed to rush to his rescue.\n\nThe farmhouses off the Yamuna and Hindon have been dubbed illegal by Noida Authority, which has pointed out that no construction is allowed on the floodplain. However, their owners have secured a stay from the Allahabad high court on any coercive action against their properties.\n\nOfficials said those taking swimming lessons were being charged Rs 50-60 an hour. \"A large number of farmhouses have come up in the area that usually gets submerged by the Yamuna's waters after a spell of heavy rain. The owners of these properties have allowed their pools to be used for commercial purposes. None of these pools are registered or have permission from the govt to run swimming classes. So, they are all running illegally. So far, we have fined the owners of six pools Rs 2 lakh each for running commercial activity in their farmhouses,\" said Anita Nagar, the deputy district sports officer in Noida.\n\nThese six pools are in farmhouses around Shahpur and Ajgarpur villages in Sector 126. Each of them are 5-7ft deep, sources said.\n\nBuilt on land originally notified for agricultural purposes, farmhouses within a few metres of the Yamuna and Hindon have seen cycles of partial demolition drives undertaken by Noida Authority. But this has failed to deter construction on the ecologically sensitive zone.\n\nSome owners have also moved the HC, alleging that the Authority does not have jurisdiction to carry out demolition drives around the floodplain.\n\nAccording to norms, every swimming pool must have a coach and a lifeguard.\n\nThe operator also should ensure the availability of safety equipment such as stretchers, blankets, lifebuoys, life jackets, first-aid boxes, artificial resuscitators, oxygen cylinders and elevated chairs.\n\nThe water of a swimming pool has to be amply clear. Rules governing swimming and important contact information must be displayed prominently on signboards by the pools. The administration issues licences to pools after verifying if they abide by these norms.\n\n\"We will continue with the drive against owners of pools operating without a nod through this month. As of now, we are identifying pools running swimming classes in farmhouses on the floodplain.

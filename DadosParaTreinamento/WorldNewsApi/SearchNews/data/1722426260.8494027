TV channel and free live stream for Euro 2024 game today", "text": "Defending champions Italy take on Switzerland in the first last-16 match at Euro 2024 this afternoon. It was not a particularly convincing group-stage from the Italians, who edged past Albania, were beaten by Spain and then needed a last-gasp equaliser against Croatia to snatch the point that confirmed their place in the knockout stages. They now take on Switzerland, who were minutes away from topping Group A. Niclas Fullkrug struck for Germany in the last minute, though, to leave the Swiss as runners-up, but they are still unbeaten in the tournament and will be eyeing a deep run. In what is the more open side of the draw, the winner of this last-16 clash will face either England or Slovakia in the quarter-finals. TV channel: In the UK, the game will be televised live on BBC One, with coverage beginning at 4.30pm. Live stream: Fans can also catch the contest live online for free via the BBC Sport and BBC iPlayer app and website.

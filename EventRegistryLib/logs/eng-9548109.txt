for a respective month of the year.\n\nThe average global air temperature last month was 15.03C -- 0.67C above the 1991 to 2020 average for April and 0.14C above the previous record set in April 2016.\n\nApril was also 1.58C warmer than an estimate of the pre-industrial average temperature for April in the years 1850 to 1900.\n\nThis means the global average temperature for the last 12 months is now 0.73C above the 1991 to 2020 average, and 1.61C above the 1850 to 1900 pre-industrial average -- beyond the 1.5C limit set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement, a treaty in which 195 nations pledged to tackle climate change.\n\nIn Europe, temperatures in April were 1.49C above the 1991 to 2020 average for the month, with temperatures \"well above average\" recorded in central and eastern Europe.\n\nThe C3S report states that temperatures last month were also above average in northern and northeastern North America, Greenland, eastern Asia, the northwest Middle East, parts of South America, and most of Africa.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o\n\nThe report notes that though the El Ni\u00f1o weather event in the eastern equatorial Pacific weakened somewhat in April, marine air temperatures also remain \"unusually high\".\n\nIndeed, global sea temperatures last month reached 21.04C, marginally below the all-time record of 21.07C set in March of this year.\n\n\"El Ni\u00f1o peaked at the beginning of the year and the sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical pacific are now going back towards neutral conditions,\" said C3S director Carla Buontempo.\n\n\"However, whilst temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Ni\u00f1o come and go, the extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records.\"\n\nC3S says conditions in April were also wetter-than-average across northern Europe, eastern and southern North America, Central Asia, the Persian Gulf, east Asia, eastern Australia, and southern Brazil.\n\nConversely, drier-than-average conditions were seen across much of Spain, Italy, the western Balkans, T\u00fcrkiye, Ukraine, southern Russia, Iceland, northern Mexico, the Tibetan Plateau, and Australia.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jamaica Observer", "body": "PARIS, France (AFP) -- April marked another \"remarkable\" month of record-breaking global air and sea surface temperature averages, according to a new report by the EU's climate monitor.\n\nThe abnormally warm conditions came despite the continued weakening of the El Nino weather phenomenon that contributes to increased heat, said the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service, pointing to human-caused climate change for exacerbating the extremes.\n\nSince June last year, every month has been the warmest such period on record, according to Copernicus.\n\nApril 2024 was no exception, clocking in at 1.58 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.\n\n\"While unusual, a similar streak of monthly global temperature records happened previously in 2015/16,\" Copernicus said.\n\nThe average temperature over the last 12 months was also recorded at 1.6C above pre-industrial levels, surpassing the 1.5C target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming.\n\nThe anomaly does not mean the Paris target has been missed, which is calculated over a period of decades.\n\nBut it does signal \"how remarkable the global temperature conditions we are currently experience are\", Copernicus climatologist Julien Nicolas told AFP.\n\nLast month was the second warmest April ever recorded in Europe, as was March and the entire winter period.\n\nSwathes of Asia from India to Vietnam have been struck by scorching heat waves in recent weeks, while southern Brazil has suffered deadly flooding.\n\n\"Each additional degree of global warming is accompanied by extreme weather events, which are both more intense and more likely,\" Nicolas said.\n\nDiverging extremes in the form of floods and droughts peppered the planet in April.\n\nMuch of Europe saw a wetter April than usual, although southern Spain, Italy and the western Balkans were drier than average, Copernicus reported.\n\nHeavy rain resulted in flooding over parts of North America, Central Asia and the Persian Gulf.\n\nWhile eastern Australia was hit with heavy rains, the bulk of the country experienced drier than normal conditions, as did northern Mexico and around the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe natural El Nino pattern, which warms the Pacific Ocean and leads to a rise in global temperatures, peaked earlier this year and was headed towards \"neutral condition\" in April, Copernicus said.\n\nStill, the average sea surface temperatures broke records in April for the 13th consecutive month.\n\nWarming oceans threaten marine life, contribute to more humidity in the atmosphere and puts at risk its crucial role in absorbing planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClimate forecasts suggest the second half of the year could even see a transition to La Nina, which lowers global temperatures, Nicolas said, \"but conditions are still rather uncertain\".\n\nThe end of El Nino does not mean an end to high temperatures.\n\n\"The extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement.\n\nThe UN already in March warned that there was a \"high probability\" that 2024 would see record temperatures, while 2023 capped off a decade of record heat, pushing the planet \"to the brink\".\n\nIt was \"still a little early\" to predict whether new records would continue to be broken, Nicolas said, given that 2023 was exceptional.", "source": {"uri": "jamaicaobserver.com",

grills world", "body": "The month of April set another record for global air and sea surface temperature averages, the latest EU's climate monitor report confirmed Wednesday.\n\nThe abnormally warm conditions came despite the continued weakening of the El Nino weather phenomenon that contributes to increased heat, said the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service, pointing to human-caused climate change for exacerbating the extremes.\n\nSince June last year, every month has been the warmest for such period on record, according to Copernicus.\n\nApril 2024 was no exception, clocking in at 1.58 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.\n\n\"While unusual, a similar streak of monthly global temperature records happened previously in 2015/16,\" Copernicus said.\n\nThe average temperature over the last 12 months was also recorded at 1.6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, surpassing the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming.\n\nThe anomaly does not mean the Paris target has been missed, which is calculated over decades.\n\nBut it does signal \"how remarkable the global temperature conditions we are currently experiencing are,\" Copernicus climatologist Julien Nicolas told Agence France-Presse (AFP).\n\nLast month was the second-warmest April ever recorded in Europe, as was March and the entire winter period.\n\nSwathes of Asia - from India to Vietnam - have been struck by scorching heat waves in recent weeks, while southern Brazil has suffered deadly flooding.\n\n\"Each additional degree of global warming is accompanied by extreme weather events, which are both more intense and more likely,\" Nicolas said.\n\nDiverging extremes in the form of floods and droughts peppered the planet in April.\n\nMuch of Europe saw a wetter April than usual, although southern Spain, Italy and the western Balkans were drier than average, Copernicus reported.\n\nHeavy rain resulted in flooding over parts of North America, Central Asia and the Persian Gulf.\n\nWhile eastern Australia was hit with heavy rains, the bulk of the country experienced drier than normal conditions, as did northern Mexico and around the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe natural El Nino pattern, which warms the Pacific Ocean and leads to a rise in global temperatures, peaked earlier this year and was headed towards \"neutral condition\" in April, Copernicus said.\n\nStill, the average sea surface temperatures broke records in April for the 13th consecutive month.\n\nWarming oceans threaten marine life, contribute to more humidity in the atmosphere and puts at risk its crucial role in absorbing planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClimate forecasts suggest the second half of the year could even see a transition to La Nina, which lowers global temperatures, Nicolas said, \"but conditions are still rather uncertain.\"\n\nThe end of El Nino does not mean an end to high temperatures.\n\n\"The extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement.\n\nThe U.N. already in March warned that there was a \"high probability\" that 2024 would see record temperatures, while 2023 capped off a decade of record heat, pushing the planet \"to the brink.\"\n\nIt was \"still a little early\" to predict whether new records would continue to be broken, Nicolas said, given that 2023 was exceptional.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType":

This period is used as the benchmark for pre-industrial levels before human activities like burning coal and oil started to influence the global climate.\n\nAs temperatures soar, the world has been recording a large number of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, floods, droughts and wildfires.\n\nThis year again, brutal heatwaves have been shattering records across Asia as Bangladesh, South Korea and parts of India also record their hottest April. Many countries have closed schools or switched to online classes and ordered people to stay at home.\n\nExtreme temperatures have killed at least 38 people in Thailand. Droughts have killed hundreds and thousands of fish in Vietnam and ruins of a 300-year-old town reappeared in the Philippines amid dwindling water levels in a reservoir.\n\nIn Europe, the continent warming fastest on Earth in the face of human-driven climate crisis, temperatures were 1.49C above the 1990-2020 average for April, making it the second hottest on record.\n\nAverage global sea surface temperatures outside the polar regions were 21.04C, the highest in records from 1979 for the month, and marginally below the record 21.07C seen in March.\n\nIt is the 13th month in a row that the sea surface temperature has been the warmest in the records for the respective month of the year.\n\nThe El Nino climate phenomenon in the Pacific, which also pushes up global temperatures, continued to weaken but marine air temperatures in general remained at an usually high level, scientists said.\n\nCarlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said even as El Nino is now fading but human-caused climate crisis will \"keep pushing\" temperatures higher.\n\n\"El Nino peaked at the beginning of the year and the sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are now going back towards neutral conditions,\" Mr Buontempo said.\n\n\"However, whilst temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Nino come and go, the extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records.\"\n\nDavid King, chair of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group and United Kingdom's former chief scientific advisor said this continuous rise in temperatures is \"incredibly concerning\".\n\n\"Adapting to extreme heat cannot be our only answer to this crisis,\" he said, calling for urgent action to reduce carbon pollution.\n\n\"We cannot nibble around the edges of this problem.

puts at risk its crucial role in absorbing planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClimate forecasts suggest the second half of the year could even see a transition to La Nina, which lowers global temperatures, Nicolas said, \"but conditions are still rather uncertain\".\n\nThe end of El Nino does not mean an end to high temperatures.\n\nMore records\n\n\"The extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement.\n\nThe UN already in March warned that there was a \"high probability\" that 2024 would see record temperatures, while 2023 capped off a decade of record heat, pushing the planet \"to the brink\".\n\nIt was

the hottest on record", "body": "Australia may have shivered through its coldest April since 2015, but the rest of the world continued to break heat records for the 11th month in a row.\n\nThe global average temperature for the last 12 months -- May 2023 to April 2024 -- has once again reached a new record, at 1.61 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, according to data released by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nDespite some parts of the world, including Australia, bringing the average down, it was the hottest April on record, 1.58C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHot spells in Europe, North America, the Middle East, eastern Asia, parts of South America and most of Africa contributed to the high global average.\n\nAndrew King, a meteorologist at the University of Melbourne, said the latest records weren't surprising.\n\n\"It shows how the world is warming and we know that's due to our greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got other factors in place, as well as, of course, the gradual, creeping rise of concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\nGlobal sea surface temperatures also continued to break records, with April the 13th month in a row to be the warmest on record.\n\nWhile the record run of high temperatures has largely been caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions, especially the burning of fossil fuels, it has been boosted by El Ni\u00f1o.\n\n\"Even in a fairly normal year these days, because of the warming of the planet, we usually still see months that are maybe third or fourth warmest on record,\" Dr King said.\n\n\"It doesn't require too much more heat to get it to record levels and that's kind of what the El Nino really provides.\"\n\nBut climate scientists say there is a margin to the extreme heat the world has experienced over the past year that can't be explained by global warming or known climate drivers.\n\nThe wild temperatures are expected to moderate somewhat as El Ni\u00f1o weakens, but Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said the warm oceans will continue to have an impact on temperatures.\n\n\"El Ni\u00f1o peaked at the beginning of the year and the sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical pacific are now going back towards neutral conditions.\n\n\"However, whilst temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Ni\u00f1o come and go, the extra energy trapped in the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records.\"\n\nDr King said that's because oceans react more slowly than land.\n\n\"The ocean acts fairly slowly, it's much slower to take up heat and move around heat than the atmosphere is,\" he said.\n\n\"There's kind of some delayed effects in the ocean, which basically mean you can still see quite high temperatures continuing beyond an El Nino event.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) data for April showed the national mean temperature was 0.51C below the 1961-1990 average, the lowest since 2015.\n\n\"No one experiences the global average temperature,\" Dr King said.\n\n\"It's not too surprising that Australia hasn't been super hot at the same time as the global temperatures have been unusually hot.\n\n\"But the global average temperature is a good indicator of how the climate is changing because it smooths out a lot of that weather and climate variability we see around the planet.\"\n\nIt was also dry across much of the country, with rainfall 26 per cent below the 1961-1990 average.\n\nThe temperature averages were brought down by the extremely cold lows in parts of South Australia and the Northern Territory, with the mean minimum temperatures the 10th lowest since 1910.\n\nAnd in some places the lowest minimum temperature on record.\n\nDespite a slightly cooler April, the BOM's winter outlook is for above-average temperatures.", "source": {"uri":

month has been the warmest such period on record.\n\nParis:\n\nApril marked another \"remarkable\" month of record-breaking global air and sea surface temperature averages, according to a new report by the EU's climate monitor published on Wednesday.\n\nThe abnormally warm conditions came despite the continued weakening of the El Nino weather phenomenon that contributes to increased heat, said the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service, pointing to human-caused climate change for exacerbating the extremes.\n\n- Record heat -\n\nSince June last year, every month has been the warmest such

monthly global temperature records happened previously in 2015/16,\" Copernicus said.\n\nThe average temperature over the last 12 months was also recorded at 1.6C above pre-industrial levels, surpassing the 1.5C target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming.\n\nThe anomaly does not mean the Paris target has been missed, which is calculated over a period of decades.\n\nBut it does signal \"how remarkable the global temperature conditions we are currently experience are\", Copernicus climatologist Julien Nicolas told AFP.\n\nLast month was the second warmest April ever recorded in Europe, as was March and the entire winter period.\n\n- Diverging extremes -\n\nSwathes of Asia from India to Vietnam have been struck by scorching heat waves in recent weeks, while southern Brazil has suffered deadly flooding.\n\n\"Each additional degree of global warming is accompanied by extreme weather events, which are both more intense and more likely,\" Nicolas said.\n\nDiverging extremes in the form of floods and droughts peppered the planet in April.\n\nMuch of Europe saw a wetter April than usual, although southern Spain, Italy and the western Balkans

However, while temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Nino come and go, the extra energy trapped in the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Carlo Buontempo, Director of C3S, said.\n\nThe global average temperature for the past 12 months (May 2023-April 2024) is the highest recorded, at 0.73 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average and 1.61 degrees Celsius above he 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, the climate agency said.\n\nAccording to C3S, the global average temperature breached the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold for an entire year for the first time in January.\n\nA permanent breach of the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement, however, refers to long-term warming over many years.\n\nAccording to climate scientists, countries need to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nEarth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.15 degrees Celsius compared to the average in 1850-1900 due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide and methane -- in the atmosphere.\n\nThis warming is considered the reason behind record droughts, wildfires, and floods worldwide.\n\nAccording to a recent study by scientists at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the impact of climate events could cost the global economy around US$ 38 trillion a year by 2049, with countries least responsible for the problem and having minimum resources to adapt to impacts suffering the most.\n\nGlobally, 2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, with the global average temperature at 1.45 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline (1850-1900).\n\nThe warming may set a new record in 2024 as scientists say El Nino -- periodic warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean -- typically has the greatest impact on global climate in the second year of its development.\n\nEl Nino continued to weaken towards neutral conditions, but marine air temperatures in general remained at an unusually high level in April, C3S scientists said.\n\nThe world is witnessing weather extremes under the combined effect of the 2023-24 El Nino and human-caused climate change.\n\nA brutal heat wave in Asia prompted the temporary closure of schools in the Philippines and broke temperature records in India, which is in the middle of a 44-day general election, apart from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar. The month also saw the heaviest rain in the UAE in 75 years.\n\nC3S scientists also said April was the thirteenth consecutive month of record-high ocean temperatures.\n\nGlobal weather agencies, including the India Meteorological Department (IMD), are expecting La Nina conditions by August-September.\n\nWhile El Nino conditions are associated with weaker monsoon winds and drier conditions in India, La Nina conditions -- the antithesis of El Nino -- lead to plentiful rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\nIn a mid-April update, the IMD said India would experience above-normal cumulative rainfall in the 2024 monsoon season with La Nina conditions being the dominant factor.\n\nEl Nino occurs every two to seven years on average and typically lasts nine to 12 months. The current El Nino event, which developed in June 2023, was at its strongest between November and January.\n\nIt is associated with increased rainfall in the Horn of Africa and the southern US, and unusually dry and warm conditions in Southeast Asia, Australia, and southern Africa.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This has only happened another time before, during the last El Ni\u00f1o event in 2015-2016.\n\nAccording to the latest climate bulletin published Tuesday by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the average global temperature last month stood at 15.03C, 0.67C higher than the 1991-2020 average for April and breaking the previous record set in 2016.\n\nThe global average temperature for the past 12 consecutive months is the highest ever recorded at 1.61C above pre-industrial levels. While this does not signal a permanent breach of the critical 1.5C global warming threshold set in the Paris Agreement, which scientists say is measured over decades, it sends a clear warning to humanity that we are approaching the point of no return much faster than expected.\n\nEastern Europe, northern and northeastern North America, Greenland, eastern Asia, northwest Middle East, parts of South America, and most of Africa all recorded above-average temperatures for the month, Copernicus said.\n\nLast month was the second-hottest April on record for Europe, marking the continuation of a trend that is warning experts. The world's fastest-warming continent saw above-average temperatures for 11 months last year, a record number of days with \"extreme heat stress,\" and 7% more precipitation than average, a recently published joint report by C3S and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) revealed. The same study also showed that heat-related mortality in the continent increased by 30% in the past two decades.\n\nApril was also northeast India's hottest since records began. Odisha, West Bengal, and Jharkhand in eastern India registered 18, 16, and 10 heatwave days, respectively, with at least nine people reportedly dead amid scorching heat.\n\nA prolonged heatwave brought temperatures appreciably above average to parts of Thailand, too, bringing the number of heat-related casualties in the country since January to 30. In all of 2023, a total of 37 people reportedly died countrywide from excessive heat.\n\nMeanwhile, Kenya and Tanzania in East Africa and the province of Guangdong in southeast China were battered by torrential rain that led to deadly floods and landslides, displacing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nDespite the gradual weakening of El Ni\u00f1o, a weather pattern associated with the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, the global sea surface temperature remained \"unusually high\" last month, Copernicus said, averaging at 21.04C - the highest value on record for April.\n\nApril also marked the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking sea surface temperatures for the respective month of the year.\n\n\"There has always been the assumption that the ocean can cope with this, that the ocean is able to absorb this heat in a predictable, linear way, without causing surprise or any sudden abrupt changes. Up until 2023. Because suddenly, temperatures [went] off the charts, and that's what is so shocking,\" said Professor Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in a recent interview with Earth.Org.\n\nThe relentless rise of ocean temperatures has taken a toll on coral reefs around the world, leading to the fourth global coral bleaching event in history, already the second this decade. These important ecosystems support at least 25% of marine species; they are integral to sustaining Earth's vast and interconnected web of marine biodiversity and provide ecosystem services valued up to $9.9 trillion annually.\n\nClimate scientist and energy systems analyst Zeke Hausfather wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that, \"while the approach used to assess annual temperatures based on the first four months of the year and El Nino/La Nina state have been largely accurate in predicting past years, they pretty wildly missed the mark in 2023.\"\n\n\"If factors that led to 2023 being warmer than expected persist, and global temperatures do not fall as the year progresses and El Nino fades and La Nina develops, than its possible we could see higher temperatures than currently forecast,\" the scientist warned.\n\nShould this scenario become a reality, the world would enter \"uncharted territory,\" as Climatologist Gavin Schmidt put it. This, Schmidt explained, could imply that climate systems are already misbehaving and the way they are operating is changing much earlier than predicted, making it increasingly difficult to predict weather patterns, including drought periods and rainfall.", "source": {"uri": "earth.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Earth.Org - Past | Present | Future"}, "authors": [{"uri":

1.45 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline (1850-1900).\n\nThe warming may set a new record in 2024 as scientists say El Nino -- periodic warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean -- typically has the greatest impact on global climate in the second year of its development.\n\nEl Nino continued to weaken towards neutral conditions, but marine air temperatures in general remained at an unusually high level in April, C3S scientists said.\n\nThe world is witnessing weather extremes under the combined effect of the 2023-24 El Nino and human-caused

temperatures.\n\nGlobal weather agencies, including the India Meteorological Department (IMD), are expecting La Nina conditions by August-September.\n\nWhile El Nino conditions are associated with weaker monsoon winds and drier conditions in India, La Nina conditions -- the antithesis of El Nino -- lead to plentiful rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\nIn a mid-April update, the IMD said India would experience above-normal cumulative rainfall in the 2024 monsoon season with La Nina conditions being the dominant factor.\n\nEl Nino occurs every two to seven years on average and typically lasts nine to 12 months.\n\nThe current El Nino event, which developed in June 2023, was at its strongest between November and January.\n\nIt is associated with increased rainfall in the Horn of Africa and the southern US, and unusually dry and warm conditions in Southeast Asia, Australia, and southern Africa.\n\nNew Delhi, May 8 (PTI) The world experienced the warmest April ever, with record heat, rain, and flooding crippling normal life in many countries, according to new data released on Wednesday.\n\nIt was also the eleventh consecutive month of record-high temperatures, a result of the combined effect of now weakening El Nino and human-caused climate change, the European Union's climate agency Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said.\n\nThe average temperature of 15.03 degrees Celsius in April was 1.58 degrees Celsius higher than the month's average for 1850-1900, the designated pre-industrial reference period.\n\nIt was 0.67 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average for April and 0.14 degrees Celsius above the previous high set in April 2016.\n\n\"El Nino peaked at the beginning of the year, and the sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are now going back towards neutral conditions.\n\nHowever, while temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Nino come and go, the extra energy trapped in the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Carlo Buontempo, Director of C3S, said.\n\nThe global average temperature for the past 12 months (May 2023-April 2024) is the highest recorded, at 0.73 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average and 1.61 degrees Celsius above he 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, the climate agency said.\n\nAccording to C3S, the global average temperature breached the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold for an entire year for the first time in January.\n\nA permanent breach of the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement, however, refers to long-term warming over many years.\n\nAccording to climate scientists, countries need to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nEarth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.\n\n15 degrees Celsius compared to the average in 1850-1900 due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide and methane -- in the atmosphere.\n\nThis warming is considered the reason behind record droughts, wildfires, and floods worldwide.\n\nAccording to a recent study by scientists at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the impact of climate events could cost the global economy around USD 38 trillion a year by 2049, with countries least responsible for the problem and having minimum resources to adapt to impacts suffering the most.\n\nGlobally, 2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, with the global average temperature at 1.45 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline (1850-1900).\n\nThe warming may set a new record in 2024 as scientists say El Nino -- periodic warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean -- typically has the greatest impact on global

However, while temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Nino come and go, the extra energy trapped in the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Carlo Buontempo, Director of C3S, said.\n\nThe global average temperature for the past 12 months (May 2023-April 2024) is the highest recorded, at 0.73 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average and 1.61 degrees Celsius above he 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, the climate agency said.\n\nAccording to C3S, the global average temperature breached the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold for an entire year for the first time in January.\n\nA permanent breach of the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement, however, refers to long-term warming over many years.\n\nAccording to climate scientists, countries need to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nEarth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.15 degrees Celsius compared to the average in 1850-1900 due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide and methane -- in the atmosphere.\n\nThis warming is considered the reason behind record droughts, wildfires, and floods worldwide.\n\nAccording to a recent study by scientists at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the impact of climate events could cost the global economy around $38 trillion a year by 2049, with countries least responsible for the problem and having minimal resources to adapt to the impacts suffering the most.\n\nGlobally, 2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, with the global average temperature at 1.45 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline (1850-1900).\n\nThe warming may set a new record in 2024 as scientists say El Nino -- periodic warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean -- typically has the greatest impact on global climate in the second year of its development.\n\nEl Nino continued to weaken towards neutral conditions, but marine air temperatures in general remained at an unusually high level in April, C3S scientists said.\n\nThe world is witnessing weather extremes under the combined effect of the 2023-24 El Nino and human-caused climate change.\n\nA brutal heat wave in Asia prompted the temporary closure of schools in the Philippines and broke temperature records in India, which is in the middle of a 44-day general election, apart from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar. The month also saw the heaviest rain in the UAE in 75 years.\n\nC3S scientists also said April was the 13th consecutive month of record-high ocean temperatures.\n\nGlobal weather agencies, including the India Meteorological Department (IMD), are expecting La Nina conditions by August-September.\n\nWhile El Nino conditions are associated with weaker monsoon winds and drier conditions in India, La Nina conditions -- the antithesis of El Nino -- lead to plentiful rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\nIn a mid-April update, the IMD said India would experience above-normal cumulative rainfall in the 2024 monsoon season with La Nina conditions being the dominant factor.\n\nEl Nino occurs every two to seven years on average and typically lasts nine to 12 months. The current El Nino event, which developed in June 2023, was at its strongest between November and January.\n\nIt is associated with increased rainfall in the Horn of Africa and the southern US, and unusually dry and warm conditions in Southeast Asia, Australia, and southern Africa.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

published on Wednesday.\n\nThe abnormally warm conditions came despite the continued weakening of the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon that contributes to increased heat, said the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service, pointing to human-caused climate change for exacerbating the extremes.\n\nRecord heat\n\nSince June last year, every month has been the warmest such period on record, according to Copernicus.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nApril 2024 was no exception, clocking in at 1.58 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.\n\n\"While unusual, a similar streak of monthly global temperature records happened previously in 2015/16,\" Copernicus said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe average temperature over the last 12 months was also recorded at 1.6 C above pre-industrial levels, surpassing the 1.5 C target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming.\n\nThe anomaly does not mean the Paris target has been missed, which is calculated over a period of decades.\n\nBut it does signal \"how remarkable the global temperature conditions we are currently experiencing are,\" Copernicus climatologist Julien Nicolas told AFP.\n\nLast month was the second warmest April ever recorded in Europe, as was March and the entire winter period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiverging extremes\n\nSwathes of Asia from India to Vietnam have been struck by scorching heat waves in recent weeks, while southern Brazil has suffered deadly flooding.\n\n\"Each additional degree of global warming is accompanied by extreme weather events, which are both more intense and more likely,\" Nicolas said.\n\nDiverging extremes in the form of floods and droughts peppered the planet in April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of Europe saw a wetter April than usual, although southern Spain, Italy and the western Balkans were drier than average, Copernicus reported.\n\nHeavy rain resulted in flooding over parts of North America, Central Asia and the Persian Gulf.\n\nWhile eastern Australia was hit with heavy rains, the bulk of the country experienced drier-than-normal conditions, as did northern Mexico and around the Caspian Sea.\n\nWarmer oceans\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe natural El Ni\u00f1o pattern, which warms the Pacific Ocean and leads to a rise in global temperatures, peaked earlier this year and was headed toward \"neutral condition\" in April, Copernicus said.\n\nStill, the average sea surface temperatures broke records in April for the 13th consecutive month.\n\nWarming oceans threaten marine life, contribute to more humidity in the atmosphere, and put at risk its crucial role in absorbing planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClimate forecasts suggest the second half of the year could even see a transition to La Ni\u00f1a, which lowers global temperatures, Nicolas said, \"but conditions are still rather uncertain.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe end of El Ni\u00f1o does not mean an end to high temperatures.\n\nMore records\n\n\"The extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement.\n\nThe UN already in March warned that there was a \"high probability\" that 2024 would see record temperatures, while 2023 capped off a decade of record heat, pushing the planet \"to the brink.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was \"still a little early\" to predict whether new records would continue to be broken, Nicolas said, given that 2023 was exceptional.", "source": {"uri":

Wednesday.\n\nThe abnormally warm conditions came despite the continued weakening of the El Nino weather phenomenon that contributes to increased heat, said the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service, pointing to human-caused climate change for exacerbating the extremes.\n\n- Record heat -\n\nSince June last year, every month has been the warmest such period on record, according to Copernicus.\n\nApril 2024 was no exception, clocking in at 1.58 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.\n\n\"While unusual, a similar streak of monthly global temperature records happened previously in 2015/16,\" Copernicus said.\n\nThe average temperature over the last 12 months was also recorded at 1.6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, surpassing the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming.\n\nThe anomaly does not mean the Paris target has been missed, which is calculated over a period of decades.\n\nBut it does signal \"how remarkable the global temperature conditions we are currently experience are\", Copernicus climatologist Julien Nicolas told AFP.\n\nLast month was the second warmest April ever recorded in Europe, as was March and the entire winter period.\n\n- Diverging extremes -\n\nSwathes of Asia from India to Vietnam have been struck by scorching heat waves in recent weeks, while southern Brazil has suffered deadly flooding.\n\n\"Each additional degree of global warming is accompanied by extreme weather events, which are both more intense and more likely,\" Nicolas said.\n\nDiverging extremes in the form of floods and droughts peppered the planet in April.\n\nMuch of Europe saw a wetter April than usual, although southern Spain, Italy and the western Balkans were drier than average, Copernicus reported.\n\nHeavy rain resulted in flooding over parts of North America, Central Asia and the Persian Gulf.\n\nWhile eastern Australia was hit with heavy rains, the bulk of the country experienced drier than normal conditions, as did northern Mexico and around the Caspian Sea.\n\n- Warmer oceans -\n\nThe natural El Nino pattern, which warms the Pacific Ocean and leads to a rise in global temperatures, peaked earlier this year and was headed towards \"neutral condition\" in April, Copernicus said.\n\nStill, the average sea surface temperatures broke records in April for the 13th consecutive month.\n\nWarming oceans threaten marine life, contribute to more humidity in the atmosphere and puts at risk its crucial role in absorbing planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClimate forecasts suggest the second half of the year could even see a transition to La Nina, which lowers global temperatures, Nicolas said, \"but conditions are still rather uncertain\".\n\nThe end of El Nino does not mean an end to high temperatures.\n\n- More records -\n\n\"The extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement.\n\nThe UN already in March warned that there was a \"high probability\" that 2024 would see record temperatures, while 2023 capped off a decade of record heat, pushing the planet \"to the brink\".\n\nIt was \"still a little early\" to predict whether new records would continue to be broken, Nicolas said, given that 2023 was exceptional. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "theborneopost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Borneo Post Online"}, "authors": [],

In recent months, the natural El Nino phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, has also raised temperatures.\n\nScientists have already confirmed that climate change caused some specific weather extremes in April, including a heatwave, opens new tab in the Sahel linked to potentially thousands of deaths.\n\nHayley Fowler, a climate scientist at Newcastle University, said the data showed the world is perilously close to breaching the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"At what point do we declare we've lost the battle to keep temperatures below 1.5? My personal opinion is we've already lost that battle, and we really need to think very seriously about keeping below 2C and reducing our emissions as fast as we can,\" she said.\n\nCountries agreed the 1.5C goal at a U.N. climate summit in 2015. It is the level scientists say would avoid the most disastrous consequences of warming, like fatal heat, flooding and the irreversible loss of ecosystems.\n\nTechnically, the 1.5C target has not yet been missed, as it refers to an average global temperature over decades. But some scientists have said the goal can no longer realistically be met, and have urged governments to cut CO2 emissions faster to limit overshoot of the target.\n\nC3S' dataset goes back to 1940, which the scientists cross-checked with other data to confirm that last month was the hottest April since the pre-industrial period.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus_Climate_Change_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copernicus Climate Change Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_temperature_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global temperature record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tipping points in the climate system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attribution of recent climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sahel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone_Layer", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone Layer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/heatwave-varanasi-010458694-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=EfAlttq7_uNrFbwVJDasbYvO41j4idiM", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548109", "eventUri": "eng-9548109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The temperature measured at 1.21 degrees Fahrenheit above the 1991 to 2020 average for April, according to the report.\n\nMay 2023 through April 2024 was the warmest 12-month stretch on record with a global average temperature of 2.90 degrees Fahrenheit above the 1850 to 1900 pre-industrial average, the report found.\n\nThe Paris Agreement goals aim to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels.\n\nGlobal sea surface temperatures across a majority of the world's oceans remained at unusually high levels in April 2024, according to the report.\n\nThe average global sea surface temperature for April for the majority of the world's oceans was 21.04 degrees Celsius, or 69.87 degrees Fahrenheit -- the highest value on record for the month of April.\n\nThe report comes as the U.S. prepares for brutal heat this summer. The latest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration seasonal outlook for the summer months, released in April, shows above average temperatures favored for much of the country between June and August.\n\nThe first heat wave of the year is already underway in parts of the South, with blistering temperatures expected from Texas to Florida throughout much of the week.\n\nThe last time Earth recorded a colder than average year was in 1976 -- 48 years ago -- according to NOAA.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o conditions over the equatorial eastern Pacific and greenhouse gas emissions have both contributed to the relentless stretch of new global temperature records. El Ni\u00f1o peaked at the beginning of the year and the sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are now going back towards neutral conditions.\n\nWhile the El Ni\u00f1o conditions are fading, the warming effects are expected to linger for months, according to scientists.\n\nSeveral regions around the planet are expected to experience record-breaking average surface air temperatures through the summer as a result of heating influence from the El Ni\u00f1o pattern, according to a study published in Scientific Reports in February.\n\nThis increases the odds of more above average and record-breaking global land and ocean temperatures in the near future.\n\nSuch a lengthy stretch of monthly global temperatures records is unusual, but a similar stretch was documented in 2015 and 2016, also El Ni\u00f1o years, records show.\n\nHuman-amplified global warming is continuing to exacerbate normal climate variations, Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement.\n\n\"Whilst temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Ni\u00f1o come and go, the extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gasses will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Buontempo said.\n\nThe latest forecasts show the current El Ni\u00f1o event officially ending in the coming weeks, transitioning to neutral conditions.

It was also the eleventh consecutive month of record-high temperatures, a result of the combined effect of now weakening El Nino and human-caused climate change, the European Union's climate agency Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said.\n\nThe average temperature of 15.03 degrees Celsius in April was 1.58 degrees Celsius higher than the month's average for 1850-1900, the designated pre-industrial reference period. It was 0.67 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average for April and 0.14 degrees Celsius above the previous high set in April 2016.\n\n\"El Nino peaked at the beginning of the year, and the sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are now going back towards neutral conditions.

A permanent breach of the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement, however, refers to long-term warming over many years.\n\nAccording to climate scientists, countries need to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Earth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.15 degrees Celsius compared to the average in 1850-1900 due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide and methane -- in the atmosphere.\n\nThis warming is considered the reason behind record droughts, wildfires, and floods worldwide.According to a recent study by scientists at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the impact of climate events could cost the global economy around USD 38 trillion a year by 2049, with countries least responsible for the problem and having minimum resources to adapt to impacts suffering the most.\n\nGlobally, 2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, with the global average temperature at 1.45 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline (1850-1900).The warming may set a new record in 2024 as scientists say El Nino -- periodic warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean -- typically has the greatest impact on global climate in the second year of its development.\n\nEl Nino continued to weaken towards neutral conditions, but marine air temperatures in general remained at an unusually high level in April, C3S scientists said. The world is witnessing weather extremes under the combined effect of the 2023-24 El Nino and human-caused climate change. A brutal heat wave in Asia prompted the temporary closure of schools in the Philippines and broke temperature records in India, which is in the middle of a 44-day general election, apart from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar. The month also saw the heaviest rain in the UAE in 75 years.\n\nC3S scientists also said April was the thirteenth consecutive month of record-high ocean temperatures. Global weather agencies, including the India Meteorological Department (IMD), are expecting La Nina conditions by August-September.\n\nWhile El Nino conditions are associated with weaker monsoon winds and drier conditions in India, La Nina conditions -- the antithesis of El Nino -- lead to plentiful rainfall during the monsoon season. In a mid-April update, the IMD said India would experience above-normal cumulative rainfall in the 2024 monsoon season with La Nina conditions being the dominant factor.\n\nEl Nino occurs every two to seven years on average and typically lasts nine to 12 months. The current El Nino event, which developed in June 2023, was at its strongest between November and January. It is associated with increased rainfall in the Horn of Africa and the southern US, and unusually dry and warm conditions in Southeast Asia, Australia, and southern Africa.", "source": {"uri":

Record-breaking heat, intense rainfall, and widespread flooding disrupted daily life across several nations, it stated. This disturbing trend continues a concerning pattern, with April marking the eleventh consecutive month of record-high temperatures. The agency attributed this phenomenon to a combination of a fading El Ni\u00f1o effect and the ongoing impact of human-induced climate change. Compared to the pre-industrial reference period of 1850-1900, the average global temperature for April soared to 15.03 degrees Celsius, marking a significant increase of 1.58 degrees Celsius.\n\nIt was 0.67 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average for April and 0.14 degrees Celsius above the previous high set in April 2016. \"El Nino peaked at the beginning of the year, and the sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are now going back towards neutral conditions. However, while temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Nino come and go, the extra energy trapped in the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Carlo Buontempo, Director of C3S, said.\n\nAccording to the latest findings from the climate agency, the global average temperature over the past 12 months, spanning from May 2023 to April 2024, has reached unprecedented levels. The data reveals a temperature increase of 0.73 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average and a staggering 1.61 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average from 1850-1900. Notably, January marked a significant milestone as the global average temperature exceeded the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold for an entire year for the first time. However, it's crucial to understand that surpassing the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit outlined in the Paris Agreement signifies a long-term trend of warming over many years.\n\nGlobally, 2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, with the global average temperature at 1.45 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline (1850-1900). The warming may set a new record in 2024 as scientists say El Nino -- periodic warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean -- typically has the greatest impact on global climate in the second year of its development. El Nino continued to weaken towards neutral conditions, but marine air temperatures in general remained at an unusually high level in April, C3S scientists said. The world is witnessing weather extremes under the combined effect of the 2023-24 El Nino and human-caused climate change.\n\nA severe heatwave engulfed Asia, prompting the Philippines to temporarily close schools and shattering temperature records in India, coinciding with its ongoing 44-day general election. The scorching conditions extended to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar as well. Additionally, April witnessed unprecedented rainfall in the UAE, marking the heaviest downpour in 75 years. Furthermore, C3S scientists reported that April continued the trend of record-high ocean temperatures for the thirteenth consecutive month. Looking ahead, global weather agencies, including the India Meteorological Department (IMD), anticipate the onset of La Ni\u00f1a conditions by August-September. While El Ni\u00f1o conditions typically result in weaker monsoon winds and drier weather in India, the emergence of La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite of El Ni\u00f1o, is expected to bring abundant rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\nIt should be noted here that El Nino occurs every two to seven years on average and typically lasts nine to 12 months. The current El Nino event, which developed in June 2023, was at its strongest between November and January. It is associated with increased rainfall in the Horn of Africa and the southern US, and unusually dry and warm conditions in Southeast Asia, Australia, and southern Africa.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)",

Last month, the world endured the hottest April on record, according to new data from Copernicus, the European Union's climate monitoring service.\n\nIt marks 11 consecutive months of unprecedented global temperatures. With that new data point, some scientists warn there is a strong chance 2024 could beat 2023 as the warmest year on record.\n\nLast month was 1.58 degrees Celsius warmer than the average April in the era before industrialization and 0.67 degrees above the average April between 1991 and 2020, Copernicus found.\n\nThe impacts have been stark. Swaths of Asia have been grappling with deadly heat: schools were closed for millions of children in Bangladesh, rice fields have shriveled in Vietnam, and people in India battled 110 degree Fahrenheit temperatures to vote in recent elections.\n\nGlobal ocean heat in April was also record-breaking for the 13th consecutive month. Ocean surface temperatures reached 21.04 degrees, the highest on record for any April, and just a fraction below the overall record set in March, according to Copernicus data.\n\nThe impact on marine systems is devastating. A mass coral bleaching event occurred this spring, which scientists said at the time could be the worst on record.\n\nUnprecedented global heat is being driven by the long-term trend of global warming -- mainly caused by humans burning fossil fuels -- boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate pattern that tends to have a warming impact.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is now weakening, but it's not surprising the world is still seeing unprecedented heat, said Zeke Hausfather, climate research lead at Stripe and research scientist at Berkeley Earth.\n\nThe year after El Ni\u00f1o peaks is usually the warmer one. And while heat records are still being set month after month, the margins at which they are being broken are smaller than they were in 2023.\n\nThe current heat \"is much more expected than the shattering of records by 0.3 degrees to 0.5 degrees we saw in the latter half of 2023,\" Hausfather told CNN.\n\nHausfather estimates a 66% chance that 2024 will be the hottest year on record, and a 99% chance it will be the second hottest. The current best estimate is it will come in at just above 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, he said.\n\nCountries have agreed to restrict global heating to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. While this refers to long-term warming over decades, rather than a single month or year, scientists have said these temporary breaches are a clear and alarming signal of accelerating climate change.\n\nWhat happens in the next few months will help scientists understand if the unexpectedly high temperatures in 2023 were a temporary phenomenon, \"or a sign of something new that might drive faster warming than previously anticipated,\" Hausfather said.\n\n\"If global temperatures fall out of record territory after the next two months, it will be a comforting sign that the climate is behaving a bit more predictably,\" he added.\n\nBut, he cautioned, even if this happens, the world is still on track for warming of close to 3 degrees, which would bring catastrophic consequences.\n\nWhile natural climate cycles like El Ni\u00f1o come and go, \"increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicolaus Copernicus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Industrialisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate variability and change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkeley Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coral bleaching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scientist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone_Layer", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone Layer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/dd9df8a7ad583432d9a4727b4d3929ed", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548109", "eventUri": "eng-9548109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The average temperature over the past 12 months has exceeded pre-industrial levels by 1.6 degrees Celsius, surpassing the 1.5-degree target outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement aimed at curbing global warming.\n\nApril also witnessed the second warmest temperatures ever recorded in Europe, echoing trends observed in March and throughout the winter season. However, geographical disparities in climate extremes were evident, with swathes of Asia enduring scorching heat waves while southern Brazil grappled with devastating floods.\n\nJulien Nicolas, a climatologist at Copernicus, underscored the correlation between rising temperatures and intensified extreme weather events, citing the increased likelihood and severity of floods, droughts, and other weather anomalies.\n\nThe warming trend extends beyond atmospheric conditions, as oceans continue to absorb excess heat. Despite the waning influence of El Nino, sea surface temperatures broke records for the 13th consecutive month in April, posing significant risks to marine ecosystems and exacerbating atmospheric humidity.\n\nLooking ahead, climate forecasts suggest a potential transition to La Nina in the latter half of the year, which typically results in cooler global temperatures. However, uncertainties remain regarding the precise trajectory of climate patterns.\n\nCarlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus, emphasized the inevitability of continued temperature records, driven by escalating greenhouse gas emissions. The United Nations has already issued warnings indicating a high likelihood of record temperatures in 2024, following a decade characterized by unprecedented heat levels.\n\nWhile the future remains uncertain, the urgency of addressing climate change is undeniable, with each passing year bringing humanity closer to irreversible environmental consequences.\n\nREAD ALSO: BMW-Tyde collaborate on world's first battery-powered luxury flying boat; Goes up for sale for AED 9.8 million", "source": {"uri": "me.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable ME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicolaus Copernicus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus_Climate_Change_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copernicus Climate Change Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate variability and change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone_Layer", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone Layer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_me/photo/default/new-project_kg9d.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548109", "eventUri": "eng-9548109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

However, while temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Nino come and go, the extra energy trapped in the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" Carlo Buontempo, Director of C3S, said.\n\nThe global average temperature for the past 12 months (May 2023-April 2024) is the highest recorded, at 0.73 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average and 1.61 degrees Celsius above he 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, the climate agency said.\n\nAccording to C3S, the global average temperature breached the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold for an entire year for the first time in January.\n\nA permanent breach of the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement, however, refers to long-term warming over many years.\n\nAccording to climate scientists, countries need to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nEarth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.15 degrees Celsius compared to the average in 1850-1900 due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide and methane -- in the atmosphere.\n\nThis warming is considered the reason behind record droughts, wildfires, and floods worldwide. According to a recent study by scientists at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the impact of climate events could cost the global economy around USD 38 trillion a year by 2049, with countries least responsible for the problem and having minimum resources to adapt to impacts suffering the most.\n\nGlobally, 2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, with the global average temperature at 1.45 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline (1850-1900). The warming may set a new record in 2024 as scientists say El Nino -- periodic warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean -- typically has the greatest impact on global climate in the second year of its development.\n\nEl Nino continued to weaken towards neutral conditions, but marine air temperatures in general remained at an unusually high level in April, C3S scientists said.\n\nThe world is witnessing weather extremes under the combined effect of the 2023-24 El Nino and human-caused climate change.\n\nA brutal heat wave in Asia prompted the temporary closure of schools in the Philippines and broke temperature records in India, which is in the middle of a 44-day general election, apart from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar. The month also saw the heaviest rain in the UAE in 75 years. C3S scientists also said April was the thirteenth consecutive month of record-high ocean temperatures.\n\nGlobal weather agencies, including the India Meteorological Department (IMD), are expecting La Nina conditions by August-September.\n\nWhile El Nino conditions are associated with weaker monsoon winds and drier conditions in India, La Nina conditions -- the antithesis of El Nino -- lead to plentiful rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\nIn a mid-April update, the IMD said India would experience above-normal cumulative rainfall in the 2024 monsoon season with La Nina conditions being the dominant factor.\n\nEl Nino occurs every two to seven years on average and typically lasts nine to 12 months. The current El Nino event, which developed in June 2023, was at its strongest between November and January.\n\nIt is associated with increased rainfall in the Horn of Africa and the southern US, and unusually dry and warm conditions in Southeast Asia, Australia, and southern Africa.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was about 0.25 of a degree warmer than the previous April high, in 2016.\n\nApril was 2.84 degrees warmer than the estimated average for the month from 1850 to 1900, the designated pre-industrial reference period against which current warming is measured.\n\nInternational climate officials have pledged to limit planetary warming to 2.7 degrees (1.5 degrees Celsius) in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change, including worsening drought and wildfires, rising sea levels and extreme heat.\n\nSome of the recent run of heat can be attributed to El Ni\u00f1o, a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific that influences temperature and weather conditions around the world, experts said. But El Ni\u00f1o has been waning, and global warming fueled by fossil fuel emissions continues to be the primary driver of high temperatures.\n\n\"El Ni\u00f1o peaked at the beginning of the year and the sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are now going back towards neutral conditions,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement. \"However, whilst temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Ni\u00f1o come and go, the extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records.\"\n\nThough 11 consecutive months of record-breaking temperatures are unusual, it's not the first time the planet has seen such a streak. A similar run occurred in 2015-16, according to Copernicus. However, the global average temperature for the past 12 months -- May 2023 through April -- is the highest on record.\n\n\"Maybe I'm a little surprised at the magnitude, but I'm not surprised at all that this was far and away the warmest year on record,\" said Emily Becker, lead writer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration's El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation blog. \"With the combination of global warming and El Ni\u00f1o, I think this is what we can expect.\"\n\nCalifornia experienced a relatively cool April compared with other parts of the world. The worst of the month's heat bore down in northern and northeastern North America, eastern Europe, Greenland, eastern Asia, the northwest Middle East, parts of South America and most of Africa, according to Copernicus.\n\nSoutheast Asia, in particular, has been gripped by an extreme heat wave that began in April and has continued for weeks, contributing to dozens of deaths. Bangladesh, Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines are among the countries most acutely affected, with triple-digit temperatures prompting school closures and contributing to devastating crop loss.\n\nOfficials in Chauk, Myanmar, in April reported a high temperature of 118.8 degrees.\n\nOceans were also hot across the world last month, with sea surface temperature averaging 69.9 degrees -- the highest value on record for April and only a few tenths of a degree cooler than the readings from March.\n\nIt is the 13th month in a row that the sea surface has had record high temperatures, Copernicus said.\n\nAntarctic sea ice extent was 9% below average -- the 10th lowest extent on record for April -- while Arctic sea ice extent was about 2% below average, a relatively small anomaly compared with readings for the month over the past 10 years.\n\nSome officials are hopeful that El Ni\u00f1o's retreat could bring relief from the hot spell. There is an 85% chance that El Ni\u00f1o's cooler counterpart, La Ni\u00f1a, will develop by fall or early winter, according NOAA's most recent outlook.\n\nBecker said models are predicting \"a small decrease in the global mean temperature\" over the next nine months, but not a substantial drop. The fact that the most recent record-hot months occurred despite El Ni\u00f1o's waning strength indicates that, even without its influence, global warming and other factors are continuing to keep temperatures high.\n\n\"Given that the global mean temperature was much higher than would have been expected with just the impact of El Ni\u00f1o, we expect to see the global mean temperature stay well above the average,\" said Becker, an associate scientist at the University of Miami.\n\nWhile La Ni\u00f1a may bring a slight reduction in heat, it does carry other risks, including the potential for an active Atlantic hurricane season and a return to dry conditions in California. La Ni\u00f1a was most recently in place from 2020 to 2023 -- a period that included California's driest three years on record.\n\nWhat's more, forecasts indicate that another hot summer could be in store for the United States and other parts of the world. That includes increased odds of above-normal temperatures in every part of the continental U.S. in July, August and September, according to NOAA's latest seasonal outlook.\n\nRegions of the U.S. most likely to experience soaring temperatures fall along a diagonal stretch from Idaho to Texas, as well as in the far Northeast. The outlook for California shows a 33%-40% chance of above-normal temperatures along the coast and a 40%-50% chance of above-normal temperatures in inland areas and the northernmost counties.\n\nWith four hot months already recorded, it's \"very likely\" that 2024 could challenge 2023's title as Earth's warmest year on record, Becker said.\n\nZeke Hausfather, a climate scientist with Berkeley Earth, said in a post on X that there is a 66% chance that 2024's heat will surpass that of last year. There is a 99% chance it will be one of the two warmest years -- at least so far.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Climate Prediction Center (CPC), an arm of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has, on the other hand, said there is a 85 per cent chance of a transition to El Nino Southern Oscillation neutral by June 2024.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 8, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Medium-Range_Weather_Forecasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicolaus Copernicus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern_Oscillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean_Dipole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean Dipole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Meteorological_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India Meteorological Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/h0b1h6/article68150579.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-04-29T023624Z_891218034_RC2ZF7AI3HU3_RTRMADP_3_TOTW-TRAVEL-TOURISM.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548109", "eventUri": "eng-9548109", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-03-01", "dateEnd": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2162, "textEnd": 2179}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 781, "textEnd": 788}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-04-", "textStart": 377, "textEnd": 387}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

scorching heatwaves, while southern Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, and the East African countries of Kenya and Tanzania have suffered deadly flooding.\n\nPakistan recorded double the normal monthly

temperatures were also unusually high, breaking records in April for the 13th consecutive month, despite the weakening El Nino, the agency said.\n\nWarmer oceans threaten marine life, and contribute

In recent months, the natural El Nino phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, has also raised temperatures.\n\nScientists have already confirmed that climate change caused some specific weather extremes in April, including a heatwave in the Sahel linked to potentially thousands of deaths.\n\nHayley Fowler, a climate scientist at Newcastle University, said the data showed the world is perilously close to breaching the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"At what point do we declare we've lost the battle to keep temperatures below 1.5? My personal opinion is we've already lost that battle, and we really need to think very seriously about keeping below 2C and reducing our emissions as fast as we can,\" she said.\n\nCountries agreed the 1.5C goal at a U.N. climate summit in 2015. It is the level scientists say would avoid the most disastrous consequences of warming, like fatal heat, flooding and the irreversible loss of ecosystems.\n\nTechnically, the 1.5C target has not yet been missed, as it refers to an average global temperature over decades.

El Ni\u00f1o and climate change are combining to make the planet so warm.\n\n(CN) -- The planet has gone through the hottest 11 months ever recorded after a record-breaking April, the European Union's climate agency said Wednesday.\n\nIn April, the global surface air temperature was 0.67 degrees Celsius (1.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than average, making it the warmest April on record globally, the Copernicus Climate Service said in its latest report.\n\nLast month was 0.14 C (0.25 F) warmer than the previous April record set in 2016 when the planet was experiencing a similarly warm period.\n\nThis extraordinary warm stretch made 2023 the hottest year on record and it is raising alarm over the effects of climate change. Besides heat waves, many regions around the planet have suffered flooding, drought, storms and wildfires.\n\nScientists say the record heat is linked in large part to the development of a moderately strong El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern in June 2023. El Ni\u00f1os are associated with warmer temperatures and more unpredictable and violent weather. However, scientists say the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is driving the record-breaking temperatures.\n\n\"Whilst temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Ni\u00f1o come and go, the extra energy trapped into the ocean and the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" said Carlo Buontempo, the Copernicus director.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o cycle continued to weaken in April toward neutral conditions, but marine air temperatures have remained unusually high, scientists noted in the report.\n\nCompared to average temperatures prior to the industrial age and the advent of burning massive amounts of fossil fuels, this April was 1.58 C (2.64 F) warmer, Copernicus said. It recorded the average global temperature in April at 15.03 C (59.05 F).\n\nOver the past 12 months, the planet was 0.73 C (1.31 F) warmer than the average temperature since 1991, a period Copernicus uses as a baseline for calculating averages in the industrial age.

It is the level scientists say would avoid the most disastrous consequences of warming, like fatal heat, flooding and the irreversible loss of ecosystems.\n\nTechnically, the 1.5\u00b0C target has not yet been missed, as it refers to an average global temperature over decades. But some scientists have said the goal can no longer realistically be met, and have urged governments to cut CO2 emissions faster to limit overshoot of the target.\n\nREAD MORE: Heat wave in Southeast

However, this anomaly has to be recorded for decades to be considered as the climate has exceeded this absolutely critical limit.\n\nIn any case, however, it is becoming clear \"how remarkable the global temperature conditions are,\" Gillien Nicolas, a climatologist at the European climate change agency Copernicus (C3S), stressed to Agence France-Presse.\n\nLast month was the second warmest ever recorded in Europe, as was March and the entire winter season.\n\nEach additional degree of global warming is accompanied by \"extreme climate events, which are becoming increasingly severe and more likely\", recalls Gillien Nicola, as the last few weeks have been marked by waves of extreme heat in Asia, India and Vietnam, while southern Brazil and other regions have been hit by extremely deadly floods.\n\nIn terms of rainfall, the Copernicus climate change agency did not draw any clear conclusions on trends in April. The month was wetter than normal in much of Europe, but drier than normal in the southern part of the continent.\n\nThe same contrast was observed outside Europe: in much of North America, Central and East Asia, the Gulf, southern Brazil, extreme rainfall caused widespread flooding. In contrast, northern Mexico, around the Caspian Sea and much of Australia experienced drought.\n\nOceans: Slight downturn\n\nOcean surface temperatures also set a record in April compared to any previous record, excluding the poles. This is the thirteenth consecutive month of record setting.\n\nThis warming threatens marine life, increases atmospheric moisture and threatens the ability of the oceans - which play a critical role - to absorb anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHowever, the sea surface temperature recorded a marginal decrease compared to March and its absolute record (21.04\u00b0 Celsius, down from 21.07\u00b0 Celsius).\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is weakening\n\nThe natural climate phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o \"continued to weaken\" in April and the situation moved towards \"neutral conditions\", the Copernicus observatory noted.\n\nThe phenomenon occurs in the equatorial zone of the Pacific Ocean and contributes to global warming.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o \"peaked at the beginning of the year,\" explained Gillien Nicola, which probably explains the slight drop in average temperatures in April compared to March.\n\nSee Also:\n\nFormer NASA engineer says he's invented a thruster that doesn't require propellant\n\n\"Model forecasts indicate a possible transition to (La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon) conditions in the second half of the year,\" but \"conditions are still quite uncertain,\" the climatologist noted.\n\nThe La Ni\u00f1a effect is the reverse of El Ni\u00f1o - leading to a decrease in global temperatures - but the end of El Ni\u00f1o does not necessarily mean that temperatures will stop rising, that global warming will slow down.\n\n\"This phenomenon is in addition to long-term trends that are persistent and directly linked to global warming, the increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the amounts of heat absorbed and stored, especially in the oceans,\" Nicolas pointed out.", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr", "dataType": "news", "title": "protothemanews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicolaus Copernicus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2-13-150x150.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548109", "eventUri": "eng-9548109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The bulletin, released this Wednesday, indicates that the air temperature on the planet's surface was 15.03 degrees last April, which is 0.67 more than the average for that month between 1991 and 2020, and 0. 14 above the previous warmest April, 2016.\n\nThe bulletin, released this Wednesday, indicates that the air temperature on the planet's surface was 15.03 degrees last April, which is 0.67 more than the average for that month between 1991 and 2020, and 0. 14 above the previous warmest April, 2016.\n\nThis streak of 11 consecutive months with heat records is unusual and to find another one you have to go back to between May 2015 and August 2016, when the planet was then under the effects of another powerful El Ni\u00f1o episode.\n\nThe historical Copernicus monthly temperature series, beginning in 1940 and analyzed by Servimedia, indicates that last April's global temperature anomaly was the twelfth highest in the record, led by September 2023 (0.93 degrees higher than normal) and followed by October, November and December of last year (0.85 degrees).\n\nCarlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said El Ni\u00f1o peaked earlier this year and sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are returning to \"neutral conditions.\"\n\n\"However, while temperature variations associated with natural cycles like El Ni\u00f1o come and go, the additional energy trapped in the ocean and atmosphere from rising greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to push global temperatures toward new records.\" \"he added.\n\nIn addition, last month was 1.58 degrees warmer than the estimate of the April average between 1850 and 1900, that is, the reference pre-industrial period.\n\nThe average monthly temperature of the last 12 months (May 2023 to April 2024) turned out to be the highest ever recorded, with 0.73 degrees above the average between 1991 and 2020, and 1.61 compared to the pre-industrial period between 1850 and 1900.\n\nIn Europe it was 1.49 degrees warmer than usual compared to the average between 1991 and 2020, making April 2024 the second warmest April on the continent. It was warmer than normal in parts of Eastern Europe, while Iceland and the region including Finland, Norway, part of Russia and Sweden were colder than usual.\n\nOutside Europe, temperatures were well above average in northern and northeastern North America, Greenland, eastern Asia, the northwestern Middle East, parts of South America and most of Africa.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon continued to weaken in the eastern equatorial Pacific, but marine air temperatures remained at an unusually high level.\n\nIn fact, the global average sea surface temperature for April 2024 between latitudes 60\u00baS and 60\u00baN - that is, the entire planet except Greenland, Antarctica and the northernmost area of America, Europe and Asia - turned out to be the highest of that month, with 21.04 degrees, just 0.03 less than the record for any month, established in March 2024.\n\nIn terms of rainfall, last April was predominantly wetter than normal across most of north-west, central and north-east Europe. Instead, it rained less than usual across almost all of the south of the continent, including large areas of eastern Spain, peninsular Italy, the western Balkans, Turkey, Ukraine and southern Russia, as well as Iceland.\n\nBeyond Europe, April was wetter than average in regions of central, eastern and southern North America; Central Asia, the Persian Gulf countries, Far East Asia, eastern Australia and southern Brazil, with heavy rains often causing flooding.\n\nIn contrast, drier than average conditions were observed in parts of northern Mexico, around the Caspian Sea and the Tibetan Plateau, as well as almost all of Australia.\n\nOn the other hand, Arctic sea ice extent was 2% below average in April, a relatively small anomaly compared to those recorded during that month in the last decade.\n\nAs in March, sea ice concentration anomalies were mixed across the Arctic and remained above average in the Greenland Sea, a persistent feature since last October.\n\nMeanwhile, Antarctic sea ice extent was 9% below average, the 10th lowest extent for April in the satellite data record, continuing the series of frequent negative anomalies observed since 2017.\n\nAs in February and March, sea ice concentrations were well below average in the northern Weddell Sea and the Ross-Amundsen Sea sector.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

Last month, the world endured the hottest April on record, according to new data from Copernicus, the European Union's climate monitoring service.\n\nIt marks 11 consecutive months of unprecedented global temperatures. With that new data point, some scientists warn there is a strong chance 2024 could end up the warmest year on record for the second year running.\n\nLast month was 1.58 degrees Celsius warmer than the average April in the era before industrialization and 0.67 degrees above the average April between 1991 and 2020, Copernicus found.\n\nThe impacts have been stark. Swaths of Asia have been grappling with deadly heat: schools were closed for millions of children in Bangladesh, rice fields have shriveled in Vietnam, and people in India battled 110 degree Fahrenheit temperatures to vote in recent elections.\n\nGlobal ocean heat in April was also record-breaking for the 13th consecutive month. Ocean surface temperatures reached 21.04 degrees, the highest on record for any April, and just a fraction below the overall record set in March, according to Copernicus data.\n\nThe impact on marine systems is devastating. A mass coral bleaching event occurred this spring, which scientists said at the time could be the worst on record.\n\nA camel crosses the road on a hot day in Barmer, Rajasthan, India, April 26, 2024. Adnan Abidi/Reuters A student doing school work at home in front of a fan following the suspension of in-person classes because of the heat, in Manila, Philippines, April 26, 2024. Lisa Marie David/Reuters\n\nUnprecedented global heat is being driven by the long-term trend of global warming -- mainly caused by humans burning fossil fuels -- boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate pattern that tends to have a warming impact.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is now weakening, but it's not surprising the world is still seeing unprecedented heat, said Zeke Hausfather, climate research lead at Stripe and research scientist at Berkeley Earth.\n\nThe year after El Ni\u00f1o peaks is usually the warmer one. And while heat records are still being set month after month, the margins at which they are being broken are smaller than they were in 2023.\n\nThe current heat \"is much more expected than the shattering of records by 0.3 degrees to 0.5 degrees we saw in the latter half of 2023,\" Hausfather told CNN.\n\nHausfather estimates a 66% chance that 2024 will be the hottest year on record, and a 99% chance it will be the second hottest. The current best estimate is it will come in at just above 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, he said.\n\nA worker splashes water on his face during a heatwave in Mumbai, India, on April 22. Indranil Aditya/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nCountries have agreed to restrict global heating to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. While this refers to long-term warming over decades, rather than a single month or year, scientists have said these temporary breaches are a clear and alarming signal of accelerating climate change.\n\nWhat happens in the next few months will help scientists understand if the unexpectedly high temperatures in 2023 were a temporary phenomenon, \"or a sign of something new that might drive faster warming than previously anticipated,\" Hausfather said.\n\n\"If global temperatures fall out of record territory after the next two months, it will be a comforting sign that the climate is behaving a bit more predictably,\" he added.\n\nBut, he cautioned, even if this happens, the world is still on track for warming of close to 3 degrees, which would bring catastrophic consequences.\n\nWhile natural climate cycles like El Ni\u00f1o come and go, \"increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep pushing the global temperature towards new records,\" said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus.\n\nA rickshaw puller wipes sweat with a scarf during the countrywide heatwave, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, April 22, 2024.

This is in correspondence to the months in previous years\n\nIn continuation of a damning 11-month trend, last month (April) was once again the hottest April on record. Every month for the past 11 months, the world has set a new temperature record.\n\nOn Wednesday (May 8), the European Union's climate change monitoring service in its monthly bulletin said that each month since June 2023 has ranked as the planet's hottest on record. This is in correspondence to the months in previous years.\n\nAs per the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), including April, Earth's average temperature was the highest on record for a 12-month period.\n\nBy how much? 1.61 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.\n\nAlso read | Has China sent a secret rover to Moon? Internet sleuths spot small device piggybacking Chang'e-6\n\nThe dataset maintained by C3S contains historical information dating back to as early as 1940. To validate their findings, scientists also compared this record with other available data and established that last month was the hottest April on record, surpassing any previous April temperatures during the pre-industrial period.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels have been identified as the main culprit behind climate change.\n\nRecent months also saw El Ni\u00f1o, a natural phenomenon which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, raise temperatures.\n\nThe extremes, including months of record-breaking sea surface temperatures, have led scientists to question whether human activities have now triggered a tipping point in the planet's climate system.\n\nAlso read | Porn star, Republican and Donald Trump's sneaky link: Who is Stormy Daniels?\n\n\"I think many scientists have asked the question whether there could be a shift in the climate system,\" said Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist as quoted by AFP.\n\nAlready, scientists have confirmed that climate change was behind some specific weather extremes last month. This includes the heatwave in Sahel that has potential links of thousands of deaths.\n\nExperts warn that the Earth is perilously close to breaching the 1.5 degree Celsius target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nHayley Fowler, a climate scientist at Newcastle University, told AFP that she thinks \"we have already lost the battle\".\n\n\"At what point do we declare we've lost the battle to keep temperatures below 1.5?

This trend underscores the relentless march of climate change, with its catastrophic impacts looming large on a global scale.\n\nScientists are now grappling with the implications of these extreme temperatures, with some speculating whether human activity has precipitated a tipping point in the climate system. Julien Nicolas, Senior Climate Scientist at C3S, acknowledged the pressing question, reflecting the concerns shared by many in the scientific community.\n\nThe primary driver behind this alarming trend is the relentless emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. However, in recent months, the natural El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, characterized by the warming of surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, has exacerbated the rise in temperatures, further amplifying the climate crisis.\n\nAlready, the effects of climate change are manifesting in devastating weather extremes. April saw a heatwave in the Sahel region, a belt of semi-arid land that stretches across Africa, potentially resulting in thousands of fatalities. Hayley Fowler, a climate scientist at Newcastle University, warned that such events bring humanity perilously close to breaching the goals outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nThe Paris Agreement aimed to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a threshold crucial for averting catastrophic consequences such as fatal heatwaves, widespread flooding, and irreversible loss of ecosystems. However, Fowler voiced skepticism about the feasibility of achieving this target, urging immediate and drastic action to curb emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n\nWhile technically the 1.5-degree target has not yet been breached, the trajectory of current trends suggests a looming crisis. Scientists stress the urgency of accelerating efforts to reduce CO2 emissions to prevent a catastrophic overshoot of the target.\n\nThe dataset provided by C3S, spanning back to 1940, has been meticulously analyzed and cross-checked with other sources to confirm the unprecedented nature of April's temperatures.

They are a critical element in the ocean ecosystem, home to around a quarter of all marine species.\n\nUnusually warm seas may also have taken a direct toll on one of the most beloved ocean-going creatures in the coldest continent, the emperor penguin.\n\n\"There have been examples of the sea-ice collapsing before emperor chicks have properly fledged, and there have been mass drowning events,\" says Prof Meredith.\n\n\"The emperor penguin is a threatened species because of climate change, and the sea-ice and the ocean temperatures are strongly implicated in that.\"\n\nIn the UK, rising sea temperatures are having an impact, with a number of creatures having vanished completely from coastal locations - some barnacle species, for example.\n\n\"The problem of climate change is that it's happening too quickly for evolution to catch up with it,\" says marine biologist Dr Nova Mieszkowska from the University of Liverpool.\n\nSign up here. Outside the UK? Sign up for our international version of Future Earth\n\nOn the Welsh coast, a team from Aberystwyth University use the same technology the police use at a crime scene to track changes in the marine population of Cardigan Bay.\n\nCollecting DNA traces from water samples, they show some invasive species are thriving, including a sea squirt that is believed to have originated in Japan and which grows like a carpet over the sea floor.\n\n\"They prevent the growth of native organisms in the areas that they colonise,\" says Prof Iain Barber, head of Life Sciences at Aberystwyth University. \"Because they do so well in our environment, they can potentially take over huge areas of the seabed.\"\n\nSpecies that are more invasive appear to be responding more strongly to global warming and the increasing water temperatures, Prof Barber says.\n\nOne important factor that's made the last year more impactful in seas all over the world has been the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, adding to human-driven emissions of warming gases.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o sees warmer waters come to the surface of the Pacific. As a result, it tends to push up the global average.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o kicked into gear in June 2023 - after a prolonged period of cooler La Ni\u00f1a conditions - and reached a peak in December, although it has since been fading away.\n\nBut other ocean basins that aren't usually affected by El Ni\u00f1o have also experienced record marine heatwaves - leaving scientists trying to work out exactly what is going on.\n\n\"The Atlantic has been warmer than usual, and this is not a pattern you normally associate with El Ni\u00f1o - so it's something somehow different,\" explains Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus.\n\nThis heat is still persisting in many ocean basins, including the tropical Atlantic.\n\nWarmer seas give tropical storms extra energy, and this could help to fuel a potentially damaging hurricane season.\n\n\"There is still a large patch of warmer than usual water in the tropical Atlantic [and] this is the main development region for tropical cyclones,\" explains Dr Buontempo.\n\n\"We are almost a month ahead in the sea surface temperature in the Atlantic with respect to the annual cycle [...] so this is an area that has to be watched.\"\n\nAs well as these short-term impacts, researchers warn there will be long-term consequences that society will have to adapt to.\n\nFor example, ice-sheet melting and deep-ocean warming are likely to continue to fuel sea-level rise in the centuries to come.\n\n\"When we talk about climate change, we tend to reduce that to changes on the surface because we live there,\" said Ang\u00e9lique Melet, a researcher with Mercator Ocean International.\n\n\"However, the deep ocean is one of the aspects [of global warming] that is committing us to centuries and millennia of [climate] change.\"\n\nBut Dr Melet stresses that is not a reason to give up on cutting emissions.\n\n\"Depending on our actions, we can reduce the speed of that warming, and we can decrease the overall amplitude of that warming and sea-level rise.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification",

And it was 1.68 degrees C (3 degrees F) warmer than in the late 1800s, the base used for temperatures before the burning of fossil fuels began growing rapidly.\n\nSince last June, the globe has broken heat records each month, with marine heat waves across large areas of the globe's oceans contributing.\n\nScientists say the record-breaking heat during this time wasn't entirely surprising due to a strong El Nino, a climatic condition that warms the central Pacific and changes global weather patterns.\n\n\"But its combination with the non-natural marine heat waves made these records so breathtaking,\" said Woodwell Climate Research Center scientist Jennifer Francis.\n\nWith El Nino waning, the margins by which global average temperatures are surpassed each month should go down, Francis said.\n\nClimate scientists attribute most of the record heat to human-caused climate change from carbon dioxide and methane emissions produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.\n\n\"The trajectory will not change until concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere stop rising,\" Francis said, \"which means we must stop burning fossil fuels, stop deforestation, and grow our food more sustainably as quickly as possible.\"\n\nUntil then, expect more broken records, she said.\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world set a goal to keep warming at or below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. Copernicus' temperature data is monthly and uses a slightly different measurement system than the Paris threshold, which is averaged over two or three decades.\n\nSamantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, said March's record-breaking temperature wasn't as exceptional as some other months in the past year that broke records by wider margins.\n\n\"We've had record-breaking months that have been even more unusual,\" Burgess said, pointing to February 2024 and September 2023. But the \"trajectory is not in the right direction,\" she added.\n\nThe globe has now experienced 12 months with average monthly temperatures 1.58 degrees Celsius (2.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris threshold, according to Copernicus data.\n\nIn March, global sea surface temperature averaged 21.07 degrees Celsius (69.93 degrees Fahrenheit), the highest monthly value on record and slightly higher than what was recorded in February.\n\n\"We need more ambitious global action to ensure that we can get to net zero as soon as possible,\" Burgess said.\n\n-- -- --\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The surface air temperature averaged 15.03 Celsius, surpassing the April average calculated between 1991 and 2020 by 0.67 degrees. Moreover, this temperature was 1.58% higher than the preindustrial reference point set at the Paris climate summit.\n\nWhile Europe experienced its second warmest April, other regions saw even greater temperature increases.

Technically, the 1.5C target has not yet been missed, as it refers to an average global temperature over decades.

They are a critical element in the ocean ecosystem, home to around a quarter of all marine species.\n\nUnusually warm seas may also have taken a direct toll on one of the most beloved ocean-going creatures in the coldest continent, the emperor penguin.\n\n\"There have been examples of the sea-ice collapsing before emperor chicks have properly fledged, and there have been mass drowning events,\" says Prof Meredith.\n\n\"The emperor penguin is a threatened species because of climate change, and the sea-ice and the ocean temperatures are strongly implicated in that.\"\n\nIn the UK, rising sea temperatures are having an impact, with a number of creatures having vanished completely from coastal locations - some barnacle species, for example.\n\n\"The problem of climate change is that it's happening too quickly for evolution to catch up with it,\" says marine biologist Dr Nova Mieszkowska from the University of Liverpool.\n\nOn the Welsh coast, a team from Aberystwyth University use the same technology the police use at a crime scene to track changes in the marine population of Cardigan Bay.\n\nCollecting DNA traces from water samples, they show some invasive species are thriving, including a sea squirt that is believed to have originated in Japan and which grows like a carpet over the sea floor.\n\n\"They prevent the growth of native organisms in the areas that they colonize,\" says Prof Iain Barber, head of Life Sciences at Aberystwyth University. \"Because they do so well in our environment, they can potentially take over huge areas of the seabed.\"\n\nSpecies that are more invasive appear to be responding more strongly to global warming and the increasing water temperatures, Prof Barber says.\n\nOne important factor that's made the last year more impactful in seas all over the world has been the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, adding to human-driven emissions of warming gases.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o sees warmer waters come to the surface of the Pacific. As a result, it tends to push up the global average.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o kicked into gear in June 2023 -- after a prolonged period of cooler La Ni\u00f1a conditions -- and reached a peak in December, although it has since been fading away.\n\nBut other ocean basins that aren't usually affected by El Ni\u00f1o have also experienced record marine heatwaves -- leaving scientists trying to work out exactly what is going on.\n\n\"The Atlantic has been warmer than usual, and this is not a pattern you normally associate with El Ni\u00f1o -- so it's something somehow different,\" explains Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus.\n\nThis heat is still persisting in many ocean basins, including the tropical Atlantic.\n\nWarmer seas give tropical storms extra energy, and this could help to fuel a potentially damaging hurricane season.\n\n\"There is still a large patch of warmer than usual water in the tropical Atlantic [and] this is the main development region for tropical cyclones,\" explains Dr Buontempo.\n\n\"We are almost a month ahead in the sea surface temperature in the Atlantic with respect to the annual cycle [...] so this is an area that has to be watched.\"\n\nAs well as these short-term impacts, researchers warn there will be long-term consequences that society will have to adapt to.\n\nFor example, ice-sheet melting and deep-ocean warming are likely to continue to fuel sea-level rise in the centuries to come.\n\n\"When we talk about climate change, we tend to reduce that to changes on the surface because we live there,\" said Ang\u00e9lique Melet, a researcher with Mercator Ocean International.\n\n\"However, the deep ocean is one of the aspects [of global warming] that is committing us to centuries and millennia of [climate] change.\"\n\nBut Dr Melet stresses that is not a reason to give up on cutting emissions.\n\n\"Depending on our actions, we can reduce the speed of that warming, and we can decrease the overall amplitude of that warming and sea-level rise.\" -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 12-month worldwide average temperature, including April, achieved a new high of 1.61 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period of 1850-1900.\n\nScientists are keenly studying these extremes, including whether human activity has tipped the climate system. Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist, emphasized that many experts worry about major climate change.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion contribute to climate change. Moreover, the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which heats surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, has also caused extreme heat.\n\nC3S reported above-average rainfall in April over Europe, while southern Spain, Italy, and the Western Balkans were drier, while Eastern Australia saw considerable rainfall, while most of the nation had below-normal precipitation, like northern Mexico, per Al Jazeera.\n\nThe C3S dataset, extending back to 1940, shows that April 2024 was the warmest April since the pre-industrial period, emphasizing the need to address climate change globally.\n\nSeparately, the \"State of the Climate in Asia 2023\" study from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) highlights the increasing rise of crucial climate change indicators in Asia. Surface temperature, glacier retreat, and sea level rise are all increasing, affecting society, economics, and ecosystems.\n\nThe analysis found that in 2023, north-west Pacific Ocean sea-surface temperatures hit record highs while the Arctic Ocean witnessed a marine heatwave. Asia is warming faster than the world average, roughly tripling during 1961-1990, per the agency's media release.\n\nWMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo emphasized the report's findings. In 2023, several nations in the area suffered droughts, heatwaves, floods, and storms. \"The report's conclusions are sobering,\" she said.\n\nRead Also: NASA's Roman Space Telescope to Hunt Primordial Black Holes-But How?\n\nMeanwhile, Newcastle University climate scientist Hayley Fowler noted that global warming is reaching a crucial threshold, threatening the 2015 Paris Agreement, which targets to reduce global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Fowler remarked that, given the current trends, the accord may be unattainable.\n\nSome experts believe it is becoming implausible to achieve the legally stipulated 1.5 degrees Celsius objective over a long-term average. They encourage countries to hasten CO2 emission reductions in order to stop rising temperatures.\n\nIn another news, the International Union of Forest Research Organizations published a study that highlights global trends in forest governance, indicating potential drawbacks in efforts to address climate change.\n\nThe study warns against focusing simply on trees' carbon worth, despite increased global and regional commitments to stop deforestation, according to Scientific American. It warns that ignoring forests' additional advantages, such as Indigenous cultural value, might lead to global forest management inequalities.\n\nThe research also highlighted the expanding use of market-based solutions like forest carbon markets, which let companies buy carbon offsets to save trees. However, researchers warn that many carbon offset schemes may not cut emissions or safeguard forests.\n\nMarket-based incentives may exclude local populations from forest management choices and prioritize short-term financial advantages above sustainable practices, the study warns. The report's co-author, Oxford social scientist Constance McDermott, stresses the necessity of state regulation and community-led efforts for appropriate management of forests.", "source": {"uri":

They are a critical element in the ocean ecosystem, home to around a quarter of all marine species.\n\nUnusually warm seas may also have taken a direct toll on one of the most beloved ocean-going creatures in the coldest continent, the emperor penguin.\n\nOne important factor that's made the last year more impactful in seas all over the world has been the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, adding to human-driven emissions of warming gases.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o sees warmer waters come to the surface of the Pacific. As a result, it tends to push up the global average.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o kicked into gear in June 2023 - after a prolonged period of cooler La Ni\u00f1a conditions - and reached a peak in December, although it has since been fading away.\n\nBut other ocean basins that aren't usually affected by El Ni\u00f1o have also experienced record marine heatwaves - leaving scientists trying to work out exactly what is going on.\n\nThis heat is still persisting in many ocean basins, including the tropical Atlantic.\n\nWarmer seas give tropical storms extra energy, and this could help to fuel a potentially damaging hurricane/cyclone/typhoon season.\n\nAs well as these short-term impacts, researchers warn there will be long-term consequences that society will have to adapt to.\n\nFor example, ice-sheet melting and deep-ocean warming are likely to continue to fuel sea-level rise in the centuries to come.", "source": {"uri": "cdn-4.timesofoman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times of Oman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "http@cdn-4.timesofoman.com", "name": "http", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coral bleaching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_heat_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean heat content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instrumental temperature record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_heatwave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine heatwave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_penguin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emperor penguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_basin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oceanic basin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Typhoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice sheet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://shabiba.eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com/2024/05/1715171549-1715171549-ohlrnwj949oz-700x400.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548109", "eventUri": "eng-9548109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Here's why", "body": "This continues an 11-month streak of record monthly temperatures\n\nWeather is not climate. This is worth remembering because it being cold and wet outside your front door does not mean global warming has stopped. As the name suggests, we need to judge global warming with global temperatures. You can be experiencing cold and damp weather at the same time as global temperatures records are being broken.\n\nFew people in the UK enjoyed spring-like conditions in April. High-pressure systems were pulling in cold and dry air from the Arctic. Hats and coats rather than shorts and sunglasses were often required. At the same time, temperatures in large swathes of North America, Greenland, Asia, the Middle East, South America, and Africa were much higher.\n\nSo high, in fact, that April 2024 was the warmest April ever recorded. This continues an 11-month streak of record monthly temperatures. The last time that happened was 2015/2016 - 2016 was the warmest year ever recorded.\n\nUntil last year, that is. In 2023, we saw an extraordinary series of temperatures on land and sea. September 2023 was 0.5\u00b0C warmer than the previous record holder of September 2020. Half a degree may not sound like very much, but in terms of changes in global average temperatures, it is a huge leap. Climate scientists are still scratching their heads trying to figure out just what is going on.\n\nAt the same time as temperatures shooting upwards, we have also seen a frightening disintegration of ice sheets in the Western Antarctic. Research published in 2023 in the leading science journal Nature concluded that the collapse of much of the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet (sometimes referred to as the WAIS) was now inevitable. We have produced so much global warming that there is now no stopping vast sheets of ice sliding off Antarctica and melting.\n\nThe good news is that this may take a couple of thousand years to completely play out. The bad news is that higher temperatures will accelerate, so the sea level may rise many metres far sooner than we had feared. Research from the British Antarctic Survey published this year detected increased melting rates in the region of the WAIS back in the 40s. This is unambiguous evidence of global climate change caused by human actions.\n\nFor many people in the UK, 2022 was the year that climate change came home. On 19 July 2022, thermometers in Coningsby, Lincolnshire hit 40.3\u00b0C. That shattered the UK's previous highest ever temperature by 1.6\u00b0C. Some people may remember the crippling heatwave of 1976, and ask, so what's new? But the highest temperature recorded that year was 35.9\u00b0C. Back in the 70s, a temperature of 40\u00b0C in the UK would have been unimaginable.\n\nPerhaps what is just as worrying as these climate records being broken by such large margins is that we are getting used to that happening. Like the proverbial frog being cooked alive in a slowly warming pot of water, we see ever-increasing evidence of climate breakdown and carry on regardless. Now, when we have some colder weather, weather that not so long ago would have been considered perfectly normal, some argue that means global warming has stopped, or even reversed. If only.\n\nOver the summer, the run of monthly temperatures records may end. That's because the warming impacts of the natural El Ni\u00f1o process may fade. Every two to seven years changes in the ocean's currents lead to a transfer of heat from the Pacific to the atmosphere and global temperatures go up. El Ni\u00f1o is certainly one factor behind this and last year's remarkable increase in temperatures. But it can only explain a small part of it.\n\nBy August or perhaps September, climate scientists will be able to say whether we will revert back to a more gradual trend of global warming. The alternative is that we may have missed crucial dynamics in the Earth system, and that the past 12 months is the beginning of something new.\n\nIf that means an acceleration of global warming towards worst case scenarios, then it may be the beginning of the end when it comes to the survival of complex industrialised societies. That may seem unimaginable, but once upon a time the UK baking in 40\u00b0C heat seemed outlandish too.\n\nIn a strange way, maybe it is here that some optimism can be found. What we think is normal can change a lot and comparatively fast.\n\nWe know that to avoid future catastrophes we must rapidly phase out fossil fuels, yet those calling for that are often labelled as dreamers. My hope is that in the not too distant future we will look back at such attitudes as strangely blinkered. We would have won the battle against dangerous climate change, and think it odd that once there were people who believed we would knowingly destroy ourselves.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk",

The world in 2015 adopted a goal of limiting warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial times, but it mostly applies to being that warm for a decade or more, not a month.\n\nWhile several factors play a role in this recent spate of extremes, \"climate change is the most important one,\" Silva said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trouble is that the world has adapted to and constructed cities designed for 20th-century temperatures and rainfall, but climate change brings more heat and downpours, said Andrew Dessler, a Texas A&M University climate scientist.\n\n\"We're departing the climate of the 20th century right now, and we just can't handle these events,\" Dessler said. \"So they're getting slightly more extreme, but they're passing our ability to handle them.\"\n\nTexas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy, said more extremes in more places were overlapping.\n\n\"Climate change is loading the weather dice against us in every part of the world,\" Hayhoe said. \"What this means is that it is increasing not only the frequency and severity of many weather extremes but also that the risk of compound events is increasing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecord-breaking\n\nIn just the first five days of May, 70 countries or territories broke heat records, said climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks temperature records across the world.\n\nNandyala and Kadapa, in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh, set an all-time high at 115 F (46.3 C), Herrera said.\n\nNitin Gadkari, a federal minister, fainted during campaigning in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Heat waves in India are by far the deadliest type of extreme weather events. At the same time, they are the type of extremes most strongly increasing in a warming world,\" climate scientist Friederike Otto said in a statement earlier this week.\n\nThis week in Southeast Asia, \"it was the hottest May night ever,\" Herrera posted on X, formerly Twitter. Parts of Thailand didn't drop below 87.6 F (30.9 C).\n\nIn late April, parts of northern Thailand hit 111 F (44 Celsius), while Chauk township in Myanmar's hottest region hit a record 118.8 F (48.2 C).\n\nMany African nations are also facing scorching heat. Herrera said it hit 117.5 F (47.5 C) in Kayes, Mali. The capital of Niger had its hottest May night, and Burkina Faso's capital had its hottest night for any month. In Chad, in north-central Africa, temperatures were expected to linger above 114 F (45.6 C) all week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deadly heat wave felt across West Africa last month was linked to human-caused climate change, scientists at the World Weather Attribution group say.\n\nIn Mexico's Ciudad Altamirano, the temperature neared 115 F (46 C) with record heat all over Latin America, Herrera said. Bolivia had its hottest May night on record, and Brazil had its hottest day in May.\n\nThe record-setting Brazil heat that stifled huge cities such as Sao Paulo also kept a rainstorm from moving over the country's south, turning it deadly, said Francisco Aquino, a climatologist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in the country's south.\n\nThere also was a massive influx of humidity from the Amazon's so-called flying rivers or air currents that carry water vapor, he said. \"These caused clouds to generate extreme rainfall,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRio Grande do Sul is reeling from the worst flood on record, with at least 90 people dead, nearly 204,000 displaced and 388 municipalities affected, local authorities say.\n\nIn the state's capital Porto Alegre, a metropolitan area with over 4.4 million inhabitants, the waters took over downtown, the international airport and several neighborhoods. Authorities said it would take days for the water level to recede.\n\nHouston is still trying to dry out after days of heavy rainfall that required more than 600 people to be rescued from flooding across Texas, including 233 people in Houston. Just northeast of the city, about 23 inches (58 centimeters) fell.\n\nMeanwhile, April brought the heaviest rains ever recorded to the United Arab Emirates, flooding portions of major highways in the desert kingdom and Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest hub for international travel.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors":

Nearly 50 days have smashed existing highs for the time of year by the largest margin in the satellite era.Planet-warming gasses are mostly to blame, but the natural weather event El Ni\u00f1o has also helped warm the seas.The super-heated oceans have hit marine life hard and driven a new wave of coral bleaching.The analysis is based on data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Service.Copernicus also confirmed that last month was the warmest April on record in terms of air temperatures, extending that sequence of month-specific records to 11 in a row.Government defeated in High Court over climate plansTensions grow as China ramps up mining for green tech Deadly Dubai floods made worse by climate changeFor many decades, the world's oceans have been the Earth's 'get-out-of-jail card' when it comes to climate change. Not only do they absorb around a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans produce, they also soak up around 90% of the excess heat. But over the past year, the oceans have displayed the most concerning evidence yet that they are struggling to cope, with the sea surface particularly feeling the heat.From March 2023, the average surface temperature of the global oceans started to shoot further and further above the long-term norm, hitting a new record high in August. Recent months have brought no respite, with the sea surface reaching a new global average daily high of 21.09C in February and March this year, according to Copernicus data. As the graph below shows, not only has every single day since 4 May 2023 broken the daily record for the time of year, but on some days the margin has been huge.Around 47 days smashed the record for that day of the year by at least 0.3C, according to BBC analysis of Copernicus data. Never before in the satellite era had the margin of record been this big. The biggest record-breaking days were 23 August 2023, 3 January 2024 and 5 January 2024, when the previous high was beaten by around 0.34C. \"The fact that all this heat is going into the ocean, and in fact, it's warming in some respects even more rapidly than we thought it would, is a cause for great concern,\" says Prof Mike Meredith from the British Antarctic Survey. \"These are real signs of the environment moving into areas where we really don't want it to be and if it carries on in that direction the consequences will be severe.\"Huge impact on sea lifeThis human-driven ocean warming is having considerable impacts on global sea life and may even be shifting the seasonal cycle of sea temperatures, according to according to a recent study.Perhaps the most significant consequence of the recent warmth has been the mass bleaching of coral globally.These key ocean nurseries turn white and die because the waters they live in grow too hot. They are a critical element in the ocean ecosystem, home to around a quarter of all marine species.Getty ImagesUnusually warm seas may also have taken a direct toll on one of the most beloved ocean-going creatures in the coldest continent, the emperor penguin.\"There have been examples of the sea-ice collapsing before emperor chicks have properly fledged, and there have been mass drowning events,\" says Prof Meredith. \"The emperor penguin is a threatened species because of climate change, and the sea-ice and the ocean temperatures are strongly implicated in that.\"In the UK, rising sea temperatures are having an impact, with a number of creatures having vanished completely from coastal locations - some barnacle species, for example.\"The problem of climate change is that it's happening too quickly for evolution to catch up with it,\" says marine biologist Dr Nova Mieszkowska from the University of Liverpool.

This year it went further east, into the Philippines. So, it's the same pattern,\" said Prof Krishna Achutarao of the Indian Institute of Technology. \"I do not particularly buy into this idea that El Ni\u00f1o is the cause.\"\n\nThat is the burning question, not just for South and Southeast Asia but for the entire world. A heatwave is a random phenomenon that comes and goes in certain seasons for a period of some days. A climate feedback is forever.\n\nApril to June, before the monsoon arrives, is always the hottest part of the year in South Asia, but now it's breaking all bounds.\n\nOn Monday, the Indian Meteorological Department reported: \"Yesterday, maximum temperatures were 44-45 degrees Celsius over Telangana, interior Karnataka, and north Madhya Pradesh; in the range of 42-44C in southeast Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Coastal Andhra Pradesh.\" Crazy hot all over the place, in other words.\n\nThe actual numbers are lower in regions farther from the equator, but the average global temperature for each of the past eleven months has been the hottest the world has ever experienced in that month.\n\nSo, obviously, something big is happening, but what? Is it just a big El Ni\u00f1o, a heating of the surface waters of the eastern Pacific that happens every three to seven years? That would be nice because it would mean it's cyclical and will go away again in due course.\n\nOr is it confirmation of climate scientist Jim Hansen's claim that the average global temperature is going to jump half a degree Celsius? He says that new rules on pollution are cutting back hard on the sulphur dioxide emissions that used to reflect a lot of incoming sunlight back into space and, therefore, cool the planet.\n\nOr have we triggered a big feedback in some natural system that we were not aware of? There's about a dozen potential tipping points that we do know about -- the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, the melting of the permafrost, a switch from rainforest to savannah in the Amazon, etc -- but there may be a few that we don't know about yet.\n\nSo which is it? It's very unlikely to be El Ni\u00f1o because this one was not particularly strong. Besides, it peaked in December and has been fading away ever since, while global temperatures go on breaking records.\n\nJim Hansen's proposed explanation is a contender because the \"brown clouds\" that used to hang over big Chinese cities and the \"ship track\" clouds from the exhaust gases of 60,000 giant tankers and container ships did reflect enough sunlight to have a significant cooling effect. Cleaning up those emissions was bound to drive up the temperature.\n\nAlas, the dates don't match very well. The emissions from Chinese factories and ocean-going ships were reduced over a period of about 15 years, whereas the \"non-linear\" jump in average global temperature began just a year ago. Moreover, some scientists doubt that the amount of cooling that was lost is big enough to explain the scale of the heating.\n\nI say \"alas\" because this leaves us with the least desirable explanation: the sudden activation of an unknown feedback. And remember how this stuff works. The heating that human beings have already caused carries us across a \"tipping point\" we cannot see, and that unleashes a feedback: warming from non-human sources that we cannot turn off.\n\nThe likeliest candidate for a new mystery feedback is the world's oceans. Since we began burning fossil fuels in a big way two centuries ago, they have absorbed about a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans emitted. More importantly, they have soaked up approximately 90% of the excess heat.\n\nNow, they may be giving some of it back. In the past 13 months, the average sea surface temperature worldwide has soared. According to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Service, it is now at an all-time global high of 21.09C.\n\nThere was not enough data about the behaviour of the deep ocean currents to put the ocean heat sink on most climate scientists' list of potential feedbacks. However, many always feared there would be a limit to how much heat the oceans could contain over the long run.\n\nWe may be about to find out where the limit is, and it could be the Mother of All Feedbacks. Or maybe it will turn out to be a false alarm this time. The fact that we don't even know which yet illustrates the depth of our ignorance and the scale of our peril.\n\nGwynne Dyer is an independent journalist whose articles are published in 45 countries.

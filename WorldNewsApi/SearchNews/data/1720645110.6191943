{"id": 231396766, "title": "A wishlist for President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum from our CEO", "text": "To begin with, congratulations are most definitely in order for Mexico\u2019s first female president. \u00a1Felicidades Presidenta Sheinbaum! I am excited about Mexico\u2019s future and am hopeful and optimistic that President-elect Sheinbaum will do well in leading the nation. However, I\u2019ve come up with a wish list for her term based on what I think are important issues for the country that she will need to address. Be a president for all Mexicans Make it clear with some initial gestures that you will be the president of all Mexicans. Unfortunately, AMLO\u2019s leadership has been characterized as accelerating the polarization in politics in Mexico. As we have seen in other countries around the world, this is not productive nor healthy for the future of the country. Demonstrate that you will take immediate steps to reduce the polarization in Mexican politics by taking into account important priorities from the opposition candidates. Make it clear how your leadership will differ from AMLO On day one, make it clear if and how your leadership and policies will be different than AMLO\u2019s. One of the biggest concerns and complaints from people who disagree with AMLO\u2019s policies is that they think you will be a \u201cpuppet of AMLO\u2019s\u201d and not act independently. Be specific in telling us how you will be different. Be proactive on nearshoring Recognize the massive opportunity that Mexico has for foreign direct investment (FDI) with the nearshoring trend and make it clear that Mexico is open for business and investment. Understand that the investment is not guaranteed and must be earned with the trust of businesses, entrepreneurs and investors. Don\u2019t hold on to the \u201csuper peso\u201d Understand that a strong peso \u2014 although politically popular \u2014 is not necessarily a good thing for Mexico and many Mexicans. Do not link your administration\u2019s success to the strength of the peso. Make changes to improve security Take serious, innovative steps towards improving the security situation in the country. Understand that there is nothing holding back Mexico\u2019s potential more than both the perception and unfortunate reality of violence throughout the country. Make Mexico a leader in renewable energy Be bold with a vision to make Mexico a world leader in solar power generation and water reuse and recycling technologies. Mexico needs to show strong leadership in these areas and every peso invested here will pay tremendous dividends to future generations of Mexicans. Inspire us with your experience and leadership in this area. Re-engage with the global community AMLO wrongly pulled back on participating in global leadership gatherings. Mexico\u2019s voice and leadership on global affairs is more important than ever. Be crystal clear on the strategic importance of a strong free trade agreement in which the US, Canada and Mexico are aligned and cooperating on global trade issues, especially in regards to China. Address infrastructure gaps The infrastructure investments made in the southeast during AMLO\u2019s term have been impressive. However, there are still significant infrastructure improvements needed in the north and central parts of the country to accelerate nearshoring investments. Not urgently addressing this will ultimately hurt Mexico\u2019s ability to fully take advantage of this opportunity. Re-think public companies Reconsider the role of the Mexican government in areas where private enterprise can help fund and accelerate growth. The state-run companies of CFE and Pemex are unfortunate examples of what can go terribly wrong when the government attempts to run companies. Take a hard look at what can be done to improve these businesses, consider how private investment can help, and reconsider AMLO\u2019s recent moves to have the government involved with building airports, highways and operating Mexicana airlines, etc. Think big and bold Inspire confidence from everyone in the country. Surprise your critics with your ability to think and act beyond your political party. Mexico has a historic opportunity given the current geopolitical situation worldwide. It truly is Mexico\u2019s opportunity to shine \u2013 but you have to believe it, make all Mexicans believe it and make the world believe it!

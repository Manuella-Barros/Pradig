{"id": 243368558, "title": "State of Emergency Extended for 60 More Days Amid Rising Crime", "text": "As it relates to the SoE, Minister of Home Affairs, Kareem Musa, reported on the 60-day extension of the State of Emergency as proclaimed by the Governor General on June 24. Ordinarily, the SoE has a limit of 30 days, but with the recent rise in crime and gang activity in parts of the country, it was put in place for 90 days, expiring on September 24. Musa delved into an explanation for the extension, citing the recent attack on the Police Commissioner\u2019s home. Kareem Musa, Minister of Home Affairs: \u201cBy way of explanation, Madam Speaker we have arrived at a point where decisions swift and certain must be made to ensure that our Belize remains on track to be the best country in which to grow up and raise a family. We cannot do that in a country where a few feel that they have the power and impetus to wreak havoc on our streets, planting seeds of fear in the minds and hearts of hardworking and law-abiding citizens of our country. Belize is certainly not a state where lawlessness, more especially that which leads to the senseless loss of life, reigns supreme. We are even more certain that we will not allow any corner of our country to fall into a state of normalized lawlessness. Opening fire on a mother and child exiting their vehicle or the elderly men riding on bicycles is not normal. Blazing bullets in the dead of night at a police station is not normal. And most certainly shooting a barrage of bullets into the home of a senior public servant, the Commissioner of Police no less, is not the Belizean way.\u201d To date, there are about 75 persons rounded up under the State of Emergency.", "summary": "As it relates to the SoE, Minister of Home Affairs, Kareem Musa, reported on the 60-day extension of the State of Emergency as proclaimed by the Governor General on June 24.\u00a0 Ordinarily, the SoE has a limit of 30 days, but with the recent rise in crime and gang activity in parts of the country, [&#8230;]", "url": "https://lovefm.com/state-of-emergency-extended-for-60-more-days-amid-rising-crime/", "image": "https://lovefm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SOE-EXTENSION-min-300x169.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:22:11", "author": "Love Staff", "authors": ["Love Staff"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "bz", "sentiment": -0.359}

that he's preparing to order an investigation into Chinese trade practices next week, a senior administration official told CNN.\n\nTrump told President Xi Jinping that he plans to direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday to begin the probe into alleged Chinese violations of U.S. intellectual property rights, the official said.\n\nThe move could lay the groundwork for Trump to impose tariffs against Chinese imports, which would mark a significant escalation in his efforts to reshape the trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\nTrump's call with Xi and his plans to open the broad trade investigation come against the backdrop of rising tensions over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nTrump planned to launch the trade investigation more than a week ago, but he delayed the move in favor of securing China's support for expanded U.N. sanctions against North Korea, the senior administration official said.\n\nTrump has being trying for months to get China to exert more pressure on North Korea, but has recently expressed frustration with the lack of progress.\n\nThe trade investigation could strain relations between the U.S. and China as the two countries wrestle with the unpredictable situation over North Korea. Pyongyang this week threatened to fire missiles near the U.S. territory of Guam during an exchange of bellicose rhetoric with Trump.\n\n\"The United States government can, and does, work with countries to address serious concerns such as North Korea while also pursuing measures to address economic concerns, such as the theft of U.S. intellectual property,\" a U.S. National Security Council official said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how China would react to the move.\n\nWhen reports of the potential trade investigation first emerged more than a week ago, China's Commerce Ministry stressed the importance of U.S.-China trade ties and of resolving differences \"through dialogue and consultation.\"\n\n\"We would like to emphasize that the Chinese government has always attached importance to intellectual property protection,\" a spokesman said. \"The results are there for all to see.\"\n\nTrump, who has been residing at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for the past week, plans to return to Washington on Monday to officially announce the trade investigation.\n\nThe decision will not only take action against alleged Chinese violations of U.S. companies' intellectual property rights, but could also be perceived as an attempt by the U.S. government to crank up the pressure on Beijing to rein in North Korea.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters on Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nBut experts say China, which accounts for around 90% of North Korea's foreign trade, is unwilling to squeeze Kim's regime hard enough to make it give up on its nuclear program because that would risk the chaotic collapse of a state that Beijing wants to keep as a strategic buffer.\n\nThe trade investigation is expected to be only one part of a multi-pronged push by the Trump administration to counter perceived Chinese trade abuses, which Trump frequently railed against as a candidate.\n\nThe administration has been eyeing other moves to rebalance the U.S.-China trading relationship. But analysts have cautioned that Trump faces a huge challenge in his desire to significantly reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which last year stood at more than $300 billion.\n\n\"Protection measures against some specific items, such as steel and aluminum, may gain political favors, but are not likely to be of much help to rebalance trade,\" economists at the Institute of International Finance wrote in a research note this week.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Chinese trade practices next week, a senior administration official told CNN.\n\nTrump told President Xi Jinping that he plans to direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday to begin the probe into alleged Chinese violations of U.S. intellectual property rights, the official said.\n\nThe move could lay the groundwork for Trump to impose tariffs against Chinese imports, which would mark a significant escalation in his efforts to reshape the trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\nRelated: Trump is getting ready to go after China on trade\n\nTrump's call with Xi and his plans to open the broad trade investigation come against the backdrop of rising tensions over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nTrump planned to launch the trade investigation more than a week ago, but he delayed the move in favor of securing China's support for expanded U.N. sanctions against North Korea, the senior administration official said.\n\nTrump has being trying for months to get China to exert more pressure on North Korea, but has recently expressed frustration with the lack of progress.\n\nThe trade investigation could strain relations between the U.S. and China as the two countries wrestle with the unpredictable situation over North Korea. Pyongyang this week threatened to fire missiles near the U.S. territory of Guam during an exchange of bellicose rhetoric with Trump.\n\n\"The United States government can, and does, work with countries to address serious concerns such as North Korea while also pursuing measures to address economic concerns, such as the theft of U.S. intellectual property,\" a U.S. National Security Council official said.\n\nRelated: Trump and China could still fall out badly over trade\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how China would react to the move.\n\nWhen reports of the potential trade investigation first emerged more than a week ago, China's Commerce Ministry stressed the importance of U.S.-China trade ties and of resolving differences \"through dialogue and consultation.\"\n\n\"We would like to emphasize that the Chinese government has always attached importance to intellectual property protection,\" a spokesman said. \"The results are there for all to see.\"\n\nTrump, who has been residing at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for the past week, plans to return to Washington on Monday to officially announce the trade investigation.\n\nThe decision will not only take action against alleged Chinese violations of U.S. companies' intellectual property rights, but could also be perceived as an attempt by the U.S. government to crank up the pressure on Beijing to rein in North Korea.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters on Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nBut experts say China, which accounts for around 90% of North Korea's foreign trade, is unwilling to squeeze Kim's regime hard enough to make it give up on its nuclear program because that would risk the chaotic collapse of a state that Beijing wants to keep as a strategic buffer.\n\nRelated: 4 ways China could hurt North Korea's economy\n\nThe trade investigation is expected to be only one part of a multi-pronged push by the Trump administration to counter perceived Chinese trade abuses, which Trump frequently railed against as a candidate.\n\nThe administration has been eyeing other moves to rebalance the U.S.-China trading relationship. But analysts have cautioned that Trump faces a huge challenge in his desire to significantly reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which last year stood at more than $300 billion.\n\n\"Protection measures against some specific items, such as steel and aluminum, may gain political favors, but are not likely to be of much help to rebalance trade,\" economists at the Institute of International Finance wrote in a research note this week.", "time": "07:47:00"}

2017.\n\nBEDMINSTER, N.J. - Even as he seeks Beijing's help on North Korea, President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order asking his trade office to consider investigating China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property, an administration official said Saturday.\n\nThat step is expected Monday but won't come as a surprise to the Beijing government. There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year.\n\nIn a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China's trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth.\n\nTrump's action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through the World Trade Organization or outside of it.\n\nTrump, who is on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf club, said Friday that he planned to be in Washington on Monday \"for a very important meeting\" and \"we're going to have a pretty big press conference.\" It was not immediately clear whether he was talking about trade was the subject.\n\nThe administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump's formal announcement.\n\nAs the crisis has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbour.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nTrump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options \"locked and loaded.\" Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm.\n\n\"At present, relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" Xi said, according to the statement provided by China's government.\n\nTrump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security. In April, he said he wouldn't label China a currency manipulator, in return for help in dealing with North Korea. This past week, Trump said he could soften his views on trade if China stepped up its assistance, leading to speculation that the investigation could be a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe forced sharing of intellectual property with Chinese firms has been a long-standing concern of the U.S. business community.\n\nA 2013 report by a commission co-chaired by Jon Huntsman, ambassador to China under President Barack Obama and Trump's nominee to be Russian envoy, pegged the losses from US intellectual property theft at hundreds of billions of dollars annually that cost the U.S. economy millions of jobs.\n\nTrump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. Trump made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China.\n\nAt the end of March, Trump asked the Commerce Department to prepare a report on the causes of the trade deficit, country by country and product by product, in 90 days. The report has yet to be released.\n\nSimilarly, the president also asked for a review about whether steel and aluminum imports were jeopardizing national security.

"body": "BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY - Even as he seeks Beijing's help on North Korea, President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order asking his trade office to consider investigating China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property, an administration official said Saturday.\n\nThat step is expected Monday but won't come as a surprise to the Beijing government. There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year.\n\nIn a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China's trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth.\n\nTrump's action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through the World Trade Organization or outside of it.\n\nTrump, who is on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf club, said Friday that he planned to be in Washington on Monday \"for a very important meeting\" and \"we're going to have a pretty big press conference.\" It was not immediately clear whether he was talking about trade was the subject.\n\nThe administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump's formal announcement.\n\nAs the crisis has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbor.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nTrump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options \"locked and loaded.\" Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm.\n\n\"At present, relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" Xi said, according to the statement provided by China's government.\n\nTrump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security. In April, he said he wouldn't label China a currency manipulator, in return for help in dealing with North Korea. This past week, Trump said he could soften his views on trade if China stepped up its assistance, leading to speculation that the investigation could be a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe forced sharing of intellectual property with Chinese firms has been a long-standing concern of the U.S. business community.\n\nA 2013 report by a commission co-chaired by Jon Huntsman, ambassador to China under President Barack Obama and Trump's nominee to be Russian envoy, pegged the losses from US intellectual property theft at hundreds of billions of dollars annually that cost the U.S. economy millions of jobs.\n\nTrump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. Trump made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China.\n\nAt the end of March, Trump asked the Commerce Department to prepare a report on the causes of the trade deficit, country by country and product by product, in 90 days. The report has yet to be released.\n\nSimilarly, the president also asked for a review about whether steel and aluminum imports were jeopardizing national security. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had hoped to finish the review by June, but parts of it remain in the final stages of interagency review.", "time": "06:28:00"}

seeks Beijing's help on North Korea, President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order asking his trade office to consider investigating China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property, an administration official said Saturday.\n\nThat step is expected Monday but won't come as a surprise to the Beijing government. There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year.\n\nIn a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China's trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth.\n\nTrump's action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through the World Trade Organization or outside of it.\n\nTrump, who is on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf club, said Friday that he planned to be in Washington on Monday \"for a very important meeting\" and \"we're going to have a pretty big press conference.\" It was not immediately clear whether he was talking about trade was the subject.\n\nThe administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump's formal announcement.\n\nAs the crisis has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbor.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nTrump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options \"locked and loaded.\" Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm.\n\n\"At present, relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" Xi said, according to the statement provided by China's government.\n\nTrump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security. In April, he said he wouldn't label China a currency manipulator, in return for help in dealing with North Korea. This past week, Trump said he could soften his views on trade if China stepped up its assistance, leading to speculation that the investigation could be a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe forced sharing of intellectual property with Chinese firms has been a long-standing concern of the U.S. business community.\n\nA 2013 report by a commission co-chaired by Jon Huntsman, ambassador to China under President Barack Obama and Trump's nominee to be Russian envoy, pegged the losses from US intellectual property theft at hundreds of billions of dollars annually that cost the U.S. economy millions of jobs.\n\nTrump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. Trump made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China.\n\nAt the end of March, Trump asked the Commerce Department to prepare a report on the causes of the trade deficit, country by country and product by product, in 90 days. The report has yet to be released.\n\nSimilarly, the president also asked for a review about whether steel and aluminum imports were jeopardizing national security. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had hoped to finish the review by June, but parts of it remain in the final stages of interagency review.\n\n___\n\nBoak reported from Baltimore.\n\n___\n\nFollow Boak on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JoshBoak and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Even as he seeks Beijing's help on North Korea, President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order asking his trade office to consider investigating China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property, an administration official said Saturday.\n\nThat step is expected Monday but won't come as a surprise to the Beijing government. There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year.\n\nIn a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China's trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth.\n\nTrump's action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through the World Trade Organization or outside of it.\n\nChina's foreign and commerce ministries did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment Sunday.\n\nWhile Beijing has promised to open more industries to foreign companies, it also has issued new rules on electric car manufacturing, data security, internet censorship and other fields.\n\nTrump, who is on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf club, said Friday that he planned to be in Washington on Monday \"for a very important meeting'\" and \"we're going to have a pretty big press conference.\" It was not immediately clear whether he was talking about trade was the subject.\n\nThe administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump's formal announcement.\n\nAs the crisis has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbor.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nTrump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options \"locked and loaded.\" Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm.\n\n\"At present, relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" Xi said, according to the statement provided by China's government.\n\nTrump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security. In April, he said he wouldn't label China a currency manipulator, in return for help in dealing with North Korea. This past week, Trump said he could soften his views on trade if China stepped up its assistance, leading to speculation that the investigation could be a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe forced sharing of intellectual property with Chinese firms has been a long-standing concern of the U.S. business community.\n\nA 2013 report by a commission co-chaired by Jon Huntsman, ambassador to China under President Barack Obama and Trump's nominee to be Russian envoy, pegged the losses from US intellectual property theft at hundreds of billions of dollars annually that cost the U.S. economy millions of jobs.\n\nTrump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. Trump made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China.\n\nAt the end of March, Trump asked the Commerce Department to prepare a report on the causes of the trade deficit, country by country and product by product, in 90 days. The report has yet to be released.\n\nSimilarly, the president also asked for a review about whether steel and aluminum imports were jeopardizing national security. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had hoped to finish the review by June, but parts of it remain in the final stages of interagency review.\n\n___\n\nBoak reported from Baltimore.

Jinping shake hands prior to a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hamburg July 8, 2017. -- Reuters pic WASHINGTON, Aug 13 -- President Donald Trump tomorrow will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force US firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, senior administration officials said yesterday.\n\nThe move, which could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods, comes at a time when Trump has asked China to do more to crack down on North Korea's nuclear missile programme as he threatens possible military action against Pyongyang.\n\nTrump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.\n\nAn administration official, however, insisted diplomacy over North Korea and the potential trade probe were \"totally unrelated,\" saying the trade action was not a pressure tactic.\n\n\"These are two different things,\" the official said, speaking to reporters on a conference call.\n\nTrump will direct US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine if an investigation is warranted of \"any of China's laws, policies, practices or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory, and that may be harming American intellectual property, innovation and technology,\" the official said.\n\n\"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies, including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, harm the US economy and workers,\" a second official said. \"The action being taken on Monday is a reflection of the president's firm commitment to addressing this problem in a firm way.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took issue with that assessment.\n\n\"President Trump's pattern continues: Tough talk on China, but weaker action than anyone could ever imagine,\" he said in a statement. \"To make an announcement that they're going to decide whether to have an investigation on China's well-documented theft of our intellectual property is another signal to China that it is OK to keep stealing.\"\n\nAny investigation that may be launched could take as long as a year to conclude, a third official said. He said it would be premature to speculate on actions that could eventually be taken against China, and added that the issue could be resolved through \"negotiated agreement.\"\n\nTrump, who will interrupt a 17-day working vacation to make a day trip to Washington for the trade announcement, had been expected to seek a so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this month, but an announcement was postponed as the White House pressed for China's cooperation on North Korea.\n\nWhile China joined in a unanimous UN Security Council decision to tighten economic sanctions on Pyongyang, Trump has kept up pressure on Beijing to do more.\n\n\"We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"If China helps us, I feel a lot different toward trade.\"\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone on Friday and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearise the Korean peninsula, the White House said in a statement. It was unclear whether the issue of trade came up.\n\nSection 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect US industries from \"unfair trade practices\" of foreign countries.\n\nThe process can bypass World Trade Organization procedures for adjudicating grievances. Though widely used worldwide, the WTO process is viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're at the beginning of this process and no firm decisions have been made as to how that is going to work in terms of whether we would pursue WTO action or action outside the WTO,\" the first administration official said.\n\nIn addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern about Chinese theft of intellectual property. The technology sector has been especially hard-hit in intellectual property disputes. -- Reuters", "time": "23:05:00"}

Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order asking his trade office to consider investigating China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property, an administration official said Saturday.\n\nThat step is expected Monday but won't come as a surprise to the Beijing government. There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year.\n\nIn a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China's trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth.\n\nTrump's action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through the World Trade Organization or outside of it.\n\nTrump, who is on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf club, said Friday that he planned to be in Washington on Monday \"for a very important meeting\" and \"we're going to have a pretty big press conference.\" It was not immediately clear whether he was talking about trade was the subject.\n\nThe administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump's formal announcement.\n\nAs the crisis has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbour .\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nTrump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options \"locked and loaded.\" Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm.\n\n\"At present, relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" Xi said, according to the statement provided by China's government.\n\nTrump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security. In April, he said he wouldn't label China a currency manipulator, in return for help in dealing with North Korea. This past week, Trump said he could soften his views on trade if China stepped up its assistance, leading to speculation that the investigation could be a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe forced sharing of intellectual property with Chinese firms has been a long-standing concern of the U.S. business community.\n\nA 2013 report by a commission co-chaired by Jon Huntsman, ambassador to China under President Barack Obama and Trump's nominee to be Russian envoy, pegged the losses from US intellectual property theft at hundreds of billions of dollars annually that cost the U.S. economy millions of jobs.\n\nTrump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. Trump made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China.\n\nAt the end of March, Trump asked the Commerce Department to prepare a report on the causes of the trade deficit, country by country and product by product, in 90 days. The report has yet to be released.\n\nSimilarly, the president also asked for a review about whether steel and aluminum imports were jeopardizing national security. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had hoped to finish the review by June, but parts of it remain in the final stages of interagency review.\n\n___\n\nBoak reported from Baltimore.\n\n___\n\nFollow Boak on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JoshBoak and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire", "time": "18:54:00"}

The Trump administration was expected to move directly into the investigation, so the memorandum reflects the more measured approach the administration also appears to be taking with steel and aluminum.\n\nSection 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect USA industries from \"unfair trade practices\" of foreign countries.\n\n\"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies, including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, harm the USA economy and workers\", a second official told reporters.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's promises to be tougher than previous presidents on trade, his administration has proceeded with high levels of caution.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force US firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, senior administration officials said on Saturday.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more\", Trump told reporters on Thursday.\n\nThe President had been expected to call for a so-called Section 301 investigation under the 1974 Trade Act earlier this month, but action was postponed as the White House tried to work with China to rein in North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nIt's unclear whether any actual repercussions for China, like sanctions or tariffs, would come from an investigation like this, and officials said there is no timeline for how long an investigation would take.\n\nCNN also reported that Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping about the expected executive action in a phone call on Friday.\n\nIf the investigation finds evidence of wrongdoing, Mr. Trump could retaliate against China with tariffs or other punitive measures that have yet to be determined.\n\n\"President Trump and President Xi agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behaviour\", the White House said in a statement. They added that the trade measure would be carried out under the rules of worldwide law and would not trigger greater conflict with China. They said that US companies had long suffered because of Chinese intellectual property violations, and that they expected Congress and the business community to support the measure.\n\nIn addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern about Chinese theft of intellectual property. \"Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet. they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk\". Though widely used worldwide, the WTO process is viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration.\n\nTrade experts and business leaders said the new investigation into intellectual property could be a sign that the trade agenda is shifting into the hands of United States Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, a respected negotiator who helped implement some of the most protectionist trade policies of recent decades during the Reagan administration.\n\nThe administration has been eyeing other moves to rebalance the U.S.", "time": "19:40:00"}

informed China's leader that he's preparing to order an investigation into Chinese trade practices next week, a senior administration official told CNN.\n\nTrump told President Xi Jinping that he plans to direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday to begin the probe into alleged Chinese violations of U.S. intellectual property rights, the official said.\n\nThe move could lay the groundwork for Trump to impose tariffs against Chinese imports, which would mark a significant escalation in his efforts to reshape the trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\nTrump's call with Xi and his plans to open the broad trade investigation come against the backdrop of rising tensions over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nTrump planned to launch the trade investigation more than a week ago, but he delayed the move in favor of securing China's support for expanded U.N. sanctions against North Korea, the senior administration official said.\n\nTrump has being trying for months to get China to exert more pressure on North Korea, but has recently expressed frustration with the lack of progress.\n\nThe trade investigation could strain relations between the U.S. and China as the two countries wrestle with the unpredictable situation over North Korea. Pyongyang this week threatened to fire missiles near the U.S. territory of Guam during an exchange of bellicose rhetoric with Trump.\n\n\"The United States government can, and does, work with countries to address serious concerns such as North Korea while also pursuing measures to address economic concerns, such as the theft of U.S. intellectual property,\" a U.S. National Security Council official said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how China would react to the move.\n\nWhen reports of the potential trade investigation first emerged more than a week ago, China's Commerce Ministry stressed the importance of U.S.-China trade ties and of resolving differences \"through dialogue and consultation.\"\n\n\"We would like to emphasize that the Chinese government has always attached importance to intellectual property protection,\" a spokesman said. \"The results are there for all to see.\"\n\nTrump, who has been residing at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for the past week, plans to return to Washington on Monday to officially announce the trade investigation.\n\nThe decision will not only take action against alleged Chinese violations of U.S. companies' intellectual property rights, but could also be perceived as an attempt by the U.S. government to crank up the pressure on Beijing to rein in North Korea.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters on Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nBut experts say China, which accounts for around 90% of North Korea's foreign trade, is unwilling to squeeze Kim's regime hard enough to make it give up on its nuclear program because that would risk the chaotic collapse of a state that Beijing wants to keep as a strategic buffer.\n\nThe trade investigation is expected to be only one part of a multi-pronged push by the Trump administration to counter perceived Chinese trade abuses, which Trump frequently railed against as a candidate.\n\nThe administration has been eyeing other moves to rebalance the U.S.-China trading relationship. But analysts have cautioned that Trump faces a huge challenge in his desire to significantly reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which last year stood at more than $300 billion.\n\n\"Protection measures against some specific items, such as steel and aluminum, may gain political favors, but are not likely to be of much help to rebalance trade,\" economists at the Institute of International Finance wrote in a research note this week.", "time": "07:47:00"}

President Donald Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, senior administration officials said on Saturday.\n\nThe move, which could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods, comes at a time when Trump has asked China to do more to crack down on North Korea's nuclear missile program as he threatens possible military action against Pyongyang.\n\nTrump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.\n\nAn administration official, however, insisted diplomacy over North Korea and the potential trade probe were \"totally unrelated,\" saying the trade action was not a pressure tactic.\n\n\"These are two different things,\" the official said, speaking to reporters on a conference call.\n\nTrump will direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine if an investigation is warranted of \"any of China's laws, policies, practices or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory, and that may be harming American intellectual property, innovation and technology,\" the official said.\n\n\"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies, including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, harm the U.S. economy and workers,\" a second official said. \"The action being taken on Monday is a reflection of the president's firm commitment to addressing this problem in a firm way.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took issue with that assessment.\n\n\"President Trump's pattern continues: Tough talk on China, but weaker action than anyone could ever imagine,\" he said in a statement. \"To make an announcement that they're going to decide whether to have an investigation on China's well-documented theft of our intellectual property is another signal to China that it is O.K. to keep stealing.\"\n\nAny investigation that may be launched could take as long as a year to conclude, a third official said. He said it would be premature to speculate on actions that could eventually be taken against China, and added that the issue could be resolved through \"negotiated agreement.\"\n\nTrump, who will interrupt a 17-day working vacation to make a day trip to Washington for the trade announcement, had been expected to seek a so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this month, but an announcement was postponed as the White House pressed for China's cooperation on North Korea.\n\nWhile China joined in a unanimous U.N. Security Council decision to tighten economic sanctions on Pyongyang, Trump has kept up pressure on Beijing to do more.\n\n\"We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"If China helps us, I feel a lot different toward trade.\"\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone on Friday and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, the White House said in a statement. It was unclear whether the issue of trade came up.\n\nSection 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries from \"unfair trade practices\" of foreign countries.\n\nThe process can bypass World Trade Organization procedures for adjudicating grievances. Though widely used worldwide, the WTO process is viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're at the beginning of this process and no firm decisions have been made as to how that is going to work in terms of whether we would pursue WTO action or action outside the WTO,\" the first administration official said.\n\nIn addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern about Chinese theft of intellectual property.

President Donald Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force US firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, senior administration officials said on Saturday.\n\nThe move, which could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods, comes at a time when Trump has asked China to do more to crack down on North Korea's nuclear missile program as he threatens possible military action against Pyongyang.\n\nTrump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.\n\nAn administration official, however, insisted diplomacy over North Korea and the potential trade probe were \"totally unrelated,\" saying the trade action was not a pressure tactic.\n\n\"These are two different things,\" the official said, speaking to reporters on a conference call.\n\nTrump will direct US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine if an investigation is warranted of \"any of China's laws, policies, practices or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory, and that may be harming American intellectual property, innovation and technology,\" the official said.\n\n\"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies, including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, harm the US economy and workers,\" a second official said. \"The action being taken on Monday is a reflection of the president's firm commitment to addressing this problem in a firm way.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took issue with that assessment.\n\n\"President Trump's pattern continues: Tough talk on China, but weaker action than anyone could ever imagine,\" he said in a statement. \"To make an announcement that they're going to decide whether to have an investigation on China's well-documented theft of our intellectual property is another signal to China that it is OK to keep stealing.\"\n\nAny investigation that may be launched could take as long as a year to conclude, a third official said. He said it would be premature to speculate on actions that could eventually be taken against China, and added that the issue could be resolved through \"negotiated agreement.\"\n\nTrump, who will interrupt a 17-day working vacation to make a day trip to Washington for the trade announcement, had been expected to seek a so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this month, but an announcement was postponed as the White House pressed for China's cooperation on North Korea.\n\nWhile China joined in a unanimous UN Security Council decision to tighten economic sanctions on Pyongyang, Trump has kept up pressure on Beijing to do more.\n\n\"We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"If China helps us, I feel a lot different toward trade.\"\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone on Friday and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, the White House said in a statement. It was unclear whether the issue of trade came up.\n\nSection 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect US industries from \"unfair trade practices\" of foreign countries.\n\nThe process can bypass World Trade Organization procedures for adjudicating grievances. Though widely used worldwide, the WTO process is viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're at the beginning of this process and no firm decisions have been made as to how that is going to work in terms of whether we would pursue WTO action or action outside the WTO,\" the first administration official said.\n\nIn addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern about Chinese theft of intellectual property. The technology sector has been especially hard-hit in intellectual property disputes.", "time": "22:13:00"}

"BEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) - Even as he seeks Beijing's help on North Korea, President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order asking his trade office to consider investigating China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property, an administration official said Saturday.\n\nThat step is expected Monday but won't come as a surprise to the Beijing government. There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year.\n\nIn a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China's trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth.\n\nTrump's action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through the World Trade Organization or outside of it.\n\nTrump, who is on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf club, said Friday that he planned to be in Washington on Monday \"for a very important meeting\" and \"we're going to have a pretty big press conference.\" It was not immediately clear whether he was talking about trade was the subject.\n\nThe administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump's formal announcement.\n\nAs the crisis has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbor.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nTrump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options \"locked and loaded.\" Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm.\n\n\"At present, relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" Xi said, according to the statement provided by China's government.\n\nTrump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security. In April, he said he wouldn't label China a currency manipulator, in return for help in dealing with North Korea. This past week, Trump said he could soften his views on trade if China stepped up its assistance, leading to speculation that the investigation could be a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe forced sharing of intellectual property with Chinese firms has been a long-standing concern of the U.S. business community.\n\nA 2013 report by a commission co-chaired by Jon Huntsman, ambassador to China under President Barack Obama and Trump's nominee to be envoy to Russia, pegged the losses from US intellectual property theft at hundreds of billions of dollars annually that cost the U.S. economy millions of jobs.\n\nTrump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. Trump made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China.\n\nAt the end of March, Trump asked the Commerce Department to prepare a report on the causes of the trade deficit, country by country and product by product, in 90 days. The report has yet to be released.\n\nSimilarly, the president also asked for a review about whether steel and aluminum imports were jeopardizing national security. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had hoped to finish the review by June, but parts of it remain in the final stages of interagency review.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"body": "BEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) -- Even as he seeks Beijing's help on North Korea, President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order asking his trade office to consider investigating China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property, an administration official said Saturday.\n\nThat step is expected Monday but won't come as a surprise to the Beijing government. There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year.\n\nIn a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China's trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth.\n\nTrump's action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through the World Trade Organization or outside of it.\n\nTrump, who is on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf club, said Friday that he planned to be in Washington on Monday \"for a very important meeting\" and \"we're going to have a pretty big press conference.\" It was not immediately clear whether he was talking about trade was the subject.\n\nThe administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump's formal announcement.\n\nAs the crisis has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbor.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nTrump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options \"locked and loaded.\" Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm.\n\n\"At present, relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" Xi said, according to the statement provided by China's government.\n\nTrump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security. In April, he said he wouldn't label China a currency manipulator, in return for help in dealing with North Korea.

northern China, Feb. 23, 2017.\n\nThe Trump administration announced Saturday that it is planning to launch an investigation into Chinese intellectual-property violations that could result in severe trade penalties, an escalation that presents both opportunities and risks at a time when the United States needs China's help to contain the North Korean nuclear threat.\n\nThe president plans to sign an executive memorandum Monday afternoon, directing his top trade negotiator to determine whether to investigate China for harming intellectual property, innovation and technology, senior administration officials said in a conference call Saturday morning.\n\nThe measure would seek to address what the U.S. business community has described as flagrant trade violations by China, which employs a variety of rules and practices to wall its market off from foreign competition and pressure U.S. companies to part with valuable product designs and trade secrets -- or to steal them outright.\n\nThe investigation, which one U.S. official said could take as long as a year, may prove to be a source of leverage to push China to do more to help contain a rising security threat from North Korea, which counts Beijing as its only powerful ally.\n\nAt the same time, it could alienate China's leadership, which is urging the Trump administration to limit its confrontational language as it faces off against the regime in Pyongyang.\n\n\"The relationship could spiral out of control, particularly if the movement on the trade front is combined with growing tensions over how to respond to North Korea,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe announcement followed a call Friday night between Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. During that call, Trump and Xi agreed that North Korea must stop its \"provocative and escalatory behavior\" and reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, according to a White House statement.\n\nXi urged Trump to exercise restraint over tensions with North Korea during a phone call, Chinese state media reported. Xi urged both sides not to do anything that would aggravate tensions. Dialogue, negotiations and a political settlement are the fundamental ways of solving the Korean Peninsula's nuclear issue, Xi said during the call, according to China's CGTN state television network.\n\n\"The Chinese leader expressed Beijing's willingness to maintain communication with the U.S. to appropriately resolve the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue,\" the network reported. Xi \"stressed that China and the U.S. share the same interests on the denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\nOn Saturday, administration officials said the new trade measure was \"totally unrelated\" to events involving North Korea.\n\nThey added that the trade measure would be carried out under the rules of international law and would not trigger greater conflict with China.\n\nBut trade and national security experts widely noted that the announcement appeared to have been delayed until after China joined the United States in voting for sanctions against North Korea at a United Nations Security Council session on Aug. 5.\n\nWhen asked about the delay during the Saturday call, the officials did not address the question directly. They said that U.S. companies had long suffered because of Chinese intellectual-property violations, and that they expected Congress and the business community to support the measure.\n\n\"If Americans continue to have their best technology and intellectual property stolen, or forcibly transferred offshore, the United States will find it difficult to maintain its current technology-leadership position and to remain one of the world's most innovative economies. This is why the president has chosen to act now and to act boldly,\" one administration official said.\n\nMichael Wessel, a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, called the measure \"a critical action, and long overdue.\"\n\n\"China's been engaged in the theft and forced transfer of U.S. technologies and intellectual property for years. Those activities haven't abated; they've accelerated as China seeks to become self-sufficient in new technologies and dominate world markets,\" he said.\n\nIf the investigation finds that China is harming U.S. companies, the Trump administration could respond by imposing tariffs, negotiating an agreement with China or other measures, the officials said.\n\nThe administration probably is eager to make progress on trade, one of Trump's biggest campaign issues, after a recent series of legislative setbacks, trade experts said. While Trump officially withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era trade deal, and will begin talks next week to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, other planned trade measures have been slow to materialize.\n\nThe results of three separate investigations into trade deficits and the national security threats posed by imports of steel and aluminum, initially expected by the end of June, have yet to appear. Meanwhile, 100 days of trade talks with the Chinese carried out in past months resulted in a few trade gains but not the ambitious changes the administration had hoped for.\n\nTrade experts and business leaders said the new investigation into intellectual property could be a sign that the trade agenda is shifting into the hands of a respected negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, who during the Reagan administration helped implement some of the most protectionist trade policies of recent decades.\n\nLike the president, Lighthizer has criticized multilateral venues such as the World Trade Organization for failing to provide adequate tools to address China's economic violations. Instead, he is leading the administration in dusting off a variety of powerful and unilateral measures under U.S. trade law, many of which the United States stopped using after the creation of the WTO, which has its own mechanisms to settle trade disputes.\n\nThe United States has previously complained at the WTO about Chinese trade policies, including its \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, which seeks to have Chinese-made materials account for 70 percent of manufacturing inputs within the next eight years. That initiative sets forth a long-term plan for China's dominance in a wide variety of high-tech industries, including electric vehicles, advanced medical products and robotics.", "time": "14:19:00"}

Beijing government. There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year.\n\nIn a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China's trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth.\n\nTrump's action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through the World Trade Organization or outside of it.\n\nTrump, who is on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf club, said Friday that he planned to be in Washington on Monday \"for a very important meeting\" and \"we're going to have a pretty big press conference.\" It was not immediately clear whether he was talking about trade was the subject.\n\nThe administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump's formal announcement.\n\nAs the crisis has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbor.\n\n\"I think China can do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"And I think China will do a lot more.\"\n\nTrump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options \"locked and loaded.\" Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm.\n\n\"At present, relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" Xi said, according to the statement provided by China's government.\n\nTrump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security. In April, he said he wouldn't label China a currency manipulator, in return for help in dealing with North Korea. This past week, Trump said he could soften his views on trade if China stepped up its assistance, leading to speculation that the investigation could be a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe forced sharing of intellectual property with Chinese firms has been a long-standing concern of the U.S. business community.\n\nA 2013 report by a commission co-chaired by Jon Huntsman, ambassador to China under President Barack Obama and Trump's nominee to be Russian envoy, pegged the losses from US intellectual property theft at hundreds of billions of dollars annually that cost the U.S. economy millions of jobs.\n\nTrump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. Trump made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China.\n\nAt the end of March, Trump asked the Commerce Department to prepare a report on the causes of the trade deficit, country by country and product by product, in 90 days. The report has yet to be released.\n\nSimilarly, the president also asked for a review about whether steel and aluminum imports were jeopardizing national security.

administration announced Saturday that it is planning to launch an investigation into Chinese intellectual-property violations that could result in severe trade penalties, an escalation that presents both opportunities and risks at a time when the United States needs China's help to contain the North Korean nuclear threat.\n\nThe president plans to sign an executive memorandum Monday afternoon, directing his top trade negotiator to determine whether to investigate China for harming intellectual property, innovation and technology, senior administration officials said in a conference call Saturday morning.\n\nThe measure would seek to address what the U.S. business community has described as flagrant trade violations by China, which employs a variety of rules and practices to wall its market off from foreign competition and pressure U.S. companies to part with valuable product designs and trade secrets -- or to steal them outright.\n\nThe investigation, which one U.S. official said could take as long as a year, may prove to be a source of leverage to push China to do more to help contain a rising security threat from North Korea, which counts Beijing as its only powerful ally.\n\nAt the same time, it could alienate China's leadership, which is urging the Trump administration to limit its confrontational language as it faces off against the regime in Pyongyang.\n\n\"The relationship could spiral out of control, particularly if the movement on the trade front is combined with growing tensions over how to respond to North Korea,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe announcement followed a call Friday night between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. During that call, Trump and Xi agreed that North Korea must stop its \"provocative and escalatory behavior\" and reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, according to a White House statement.\n\nXi urged President Trump to exercise restraint over tensions with North Korea during a phone call, Chinese state media reported. Xi urged both sides not to do anything that would aggravate tensions. Dialogue, negotiations and a political settlement are the fundamental ways of solving the Korean Peninsula's nuclear issue, Xi said during the call, according to China's CGTN state television network.\n\n\"The Chinese leader expressed Beijing's willingness to maintain communication with the U.S. to appropriately resolve the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue,\" the network reported. Xi \"stressed that China and the U.S. share the same interests on the denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\nOn Saturday, administration officials said the new trade measure was \"totally unrelated\" to events involving North Korea.\n\nThey added that the trade measure would be carried out under the rules of international law and would not trigger greater conflict with China.\n\nBut trade and national security experts widely noted that the announcement appeared to have been delayed until after China joined the United States in voting for sanctions against North Korea at a United Nations Security Council session on Aug. 5.\n\nWhen asked about the delay during the Saturday call, the officials did not address the question directly. They said that U.S. companies had long suffered because of Chinese intellectual-property violations, and that they expected Congress and the business community to support the measure.\n\n\"If Americans continue to have their best technology and intellectual property stolen, or forcibly transferred offshore, the United States will find it difficult to maintain its current technology-leadership position and to remain one of the world's most innovative economies. This is why the president has chosen to act now and to act boldly,\" one administration official said.\n\nMichael Wessel, a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, called the measure \"a critical action, and long overdue.\"\n\n\"China's been engaged in the theft and forced transfer of U.S. technologies and intellectual property for years. Those activities haven't abated; they've accelerated as China seeks to become self-sufficient in new technologies and dominate world markets,\" he said.\n\nIf the investigation finds that China is harming U.S. companies, the Trump administration could respond by imposing tariffs, negotiating an agreement with China or other measures, the officials said.\n\nThe administration probably is eager to make progress on trade, one of Trump's biggest campaign issues, after a recent series of legislative setbacks, trade experts said. While Trump officially withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era trade deal, and will begin talks next week to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, other planned trade measures have been slow to materialize.\n\nThe results of three separate investigations into trade deficits and the national security threats posed by imports of steel and aluminum, initially expected by the end of June, have yet to appear. Meanwhile, 100 days of trade talks with the Chinese carried out in past months resulted in a few trade gains but not the ambitious changes the administration had hoped for.\n\nTrade experts and business leaders said the new investigation into intellectual property could be a sign that the trade agenda is shifting into the hands of a respected negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, who during the Reagan administration helped implement some of the most protectionist trade policies of recent decades.\n\nLike the president, Lighthizer has criticized multilateral venues such as the World Trade Organization for failing to provide adequate tools to address China's economic violations. Instead, he is leading the administration in dusting off a variety of powerful and unilateral measures under U.S. trade law, many of which the United States stopped using after the creation of the WTO, which has its own mechanisms to settle trade disputes.\n\nThe United States has previously complained at the WTO about Chinese trade policies, including its \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, which seeks to have Chinese-made materials account for 70 percent of manufacturing inputs within the next eight years. That initiative sets forth a long-term plan for China's dominance in a wide variety of high-tech industries, including electric vehicles, advanced medial products and robotics.\n\nDenyer reported from Beijing.

While it's unclear how much detail Trump will get into in the announcement, administration officials expect U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to open an investigation against China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe pending announcement comes amid heightened tension between the United States and China, even after the Trump administration scored a victory in persuading Beijing to sign onto new United Nations sanctions on North Korea.\n\nIt is not clear whether China has the motivation to close off the spigot entirely with North Korea. China is North Korea's main trading partner, and it is not interested in seeing the economic collapse of the regime, which could send a flood of refugees into China and destabilize its northern provinces.\n\nThe ordering of the investigation will not immediately impose sanctions but could lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump has expressed frustration in recent months over what he sees as China's unfair trade policies.\n\nThe closely watched announcement appears to have bipartisan support, although Democrats have accused Trump of not being tough enough on trade.\n\nTrump suggested in comments to reporters on Thursday that he might be more lenient on China if officials take more aggressive action to stop North Korea from developing a nuclear weapon that could strike the United States. But it appears his longstanding frustration with China has remained.\n\nTrump told reporters in New Jersey that he would call Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday night to discuss North Korea. \"We have been working very closely with China and with other countries,\" he said.\n\nThe president was slated to announce the China trade action last week. But the announcement was delayed amid sensitive negotiations with China over the UN sanctions.\n\nStill, Trump has delayed trade action before, amid pressure from business groups and major trading partners.\n\nTwo Commerce Department reports examining whether to restrict steel and aluminum imports on national security grounds were expected by the end of June but have been bottled up in an internal review. Trading partners raised threats of retaliation and domestic steel users complained of being hurt by price increases and restricted supply.\n\nThere also has been no sign of a third pending report, examining the causes of significant bilateral trade deficits, which was also due by the end of June,\n\nBusiness groups, however, may welcome Section 301 action, because companies have complained they are often forced to share valuable technology with Chinese counterparts as a condition of doing business in the country.\n\nSection 301 allows the U.S. to take unilateral action against countries that impose barriers to U.S. exports. That could take the form of increased import duties, but that would likely violate WTO rules. So the administration could look for some other form of retaliation, like restricting Chinese investment in the United States.", "time": "01:23:00"}

President Donald Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, senior administration officials said on Saturday.\n\nThe move, which could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods, comes at a time when Trump has asked China to do more to crack down on North Korea's nuclear missile program as he threatens possible military action against Pyongyang.\n\nTrump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.\n\nAn administration official, however, insisted diplomacy over North Korea and the potential trade probe were \"totally unrelated,\" saying the trade action was not a pressure tactic.\n\n\"These are two different things,\" the official said, speaking to reporters on a conference call.\n\nTrump will direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine if an investigation is warranted of \"any of China's laws, policies, practices or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory, and that may be harming American intellectual property, innovation and technology,\" the official said.\n\n\"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies, including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, harm the U.S. economy and workers,\" a second official told reporters. \"The action being taken on Monday is a reflection of the president's firm commitment to addressing this problem in a firm way.\"\n\nAny investigation that may be launched could take as long as a year to conclude, a third official said. He said it would be premature to speculate on actions that could eventually be taken against China, and added that the issue could be resolved through \"negotiated agreement.\"\n\nTrump, who will interrupt a 17-day working vacation to make a day trip to Washington for the trade announcement, had been expected to seek a so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this month, but an announcement was postponed as the White House pressed for China's cooperation on North Korea.\n\nWhile China joined in a unanimous U.N. Security Council decision to tighten economic sanctions on Pyongyang, Trump has kept up pressure on Beijing to do more.\n\n\"We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"If China helps us, I feel a lot different toward trade.\"\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone on Friday and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, the White House said in a statement. It was unclear whether the issue of trade came up.\n\nSection 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries from \"unfair trade practices\" of foreign countries.\n\nThe process can bypass World Trade Organization procedures for adjudicating grievances. Though widely used worldwide, the WTO process is viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're at the beginning of this process and no firm decisions have been made as to how that is going to work in terms of whether we would pursue WTO action or action outside the WTO,\" the first administration official said.\n\nIn addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern about Chinese theft of intellectual property. The technology sector has been especially hard-hit in intellectual property disputes.\n\n(Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Sandra Maler)\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

Trump administration will take steps Monday to launch an investigation into Chinese intellectual property violations that could result in severe trade penalties, a threat the United States could wield to pressure Beijing into improving its economic behavior and doing more to contain North Korea's nuclear threat.\n\nThe president plans to sign an executive memorandum Monday afternoon directing his top trade negotiator to determine whether to investigate China for harming intellectual property, innovation and technology, senior administration officials said in a conference call Saturday morning.\n\nThe measure would seek to address what the U.S. business community has described as flagrant trade violations by China, which employs a variety of rules and practices to wall its market off from foreign competition and pressure U.S. companies to part with valuable product designs and trade secrets -- or to steal them outright.\n\nThe investigation could take as long as a year, U.S. officials said. In the meantime, it may help to satisfy President Trump's political promises to get tougher on countries that cheat the United States economically, following a series of setbacks and delays on ambitious trade measures floated by the administration in past months.\n\nIt may also prove to be a source of leverage to push China to do more to help contain a rising security threat from North Korea, which counts Beijing as its only powerful ally.\n\n[Beijing warns Pyongyang: You're on your own if you go after the United States]\n\nYet analysts said the measure could also backfire, resulting in more hostility and tension between the world's two largest economies at a time when their cooperation is critical to a diplomatic resolution on North Korea.\n\n\"The [U.S.-China] relationship could spiral out of control, particularly if the movement on the trade front is combined with growing tensions over how to respond to North Korea,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nInternational tensions have escalated as Trump and North Korean President Kim Jung Un traded threats of nuclear war in recent days. Trump tweeted Friday that military solutions are \"locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.\"\n\nIn a call Friday, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed that North Korea must stop its \"provocative and escalatory behavior\" and reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, the White House said.\n\nOn Saturday, administration officials said the new trade measure was \"totally unrelated\" to events with North Korea. They added that the trade measure would be carried out under the rules of international law and would not trigger greater conflict with China. But trade and national security experts widely noted that the trade announcement appeared to have been delayed until after China joined the United States in voting for sanction against North Korea at a United Nations Security Council session on Aug. 5.\n\nWhen asked about the delay in the call on Saturday, the officials did not address the question directly. They said that U.S. companies had long suffered because of Chinese intellectual property violations, and that they expected Congress and the business community to support the measure.\n\n\"If Americans continue to have their best technology and intellectual property stolen, or forcibly transferred offshore, the United States will find it difficult to maintain its current technology leadership position and to remain one of the world's most innovative economies. This is why the president has chosen to act now and to act boldly,\" one administration official said.\n\n[The dark side of Trump's much-hyped China trade deal: It could literally make you sick]\n\nMichael Wessel, a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, called the measure \"a critical action, and long overdue.\" \"China's been engaged in the theft and forced transfer of U.S. technologies and intellectual property for years. Those activities haven't abated; they've accelerated as China seeks to become self-sufficient in new technologies and dominate world markets,\" he said.\n\nIf the investigation finds that China is harming U.S. companies, the Trump administration could respond by imposing tariffs, negotiating an agreement with China, or other measures, the officials said.\n\nThe administration is likely eager to make progress on trade, one of Trump's biggest campaign issues, after a recent series of legislative setbacks, trade experts said. While Trump officially withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era trade deal, and will begin talks next week to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, other planned trade measures have been slow to materialize.\n\nThe results of three separate investigations into trade deficits and the national security threats posed by imports of steel and aluminum, initially expected by the end of June, have yet to appear. Meanwhile, 100 days of trade talks with the Chinese carried out in past months resulted in a few trade gains but not the ambitious changes the administration had hoped for.\n\nTrade experts and business leaders said the new investigation into intellectual property could be a sign that the trade agenda is shifting into the hands of United States Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, a respected negotiator who helped implement some of the most protectionist trade policies of recent decades during the Reagan administration.\n\nLike the president, Lighthizer has criticized multilateral venues like the World Trade Organization for failing to provide adequate tools to address China's economic violations. Instead, he is leading the administration is dusting off a variety of powerful and unilateral measures under U.S. trade law, many of which the United States stopped using after the creation of the WTO, which has its own mechanisms to settle trade disputes.\n\nIn the conference call, officials did not rule out working with the WTO or other countries to penalize Chinese intellectual property violations, saying that the portions of U.S. trade law they are relying on, Sections 301 and 302 of the 1974 trade law, allow them to take a broad range of actions.\n\nThe United States has previously complained at the WTO about Chinese trade policies, including its \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, which seeks to have Chinese-made materials account for 70 percent of manufacturing inputs within the next eight years. That initiative sets forth a long-term plan for China's dominance in a wide variety of high-tech industries, including electric vehicles, advanced medial products and robotics.\n\nMeanwhile, China has continued to maintain barriers that prevent U.S. companies from accessing its market, while adding new requirements for U.S. companies to share technology with the Chinese state, like a recent cybersecurity law.\n\nThe U.S. business community, which traditionally lobbied U.S. administrations to take a softer approach toward Beijing to protect access to a profitable market, has shifted toward a tougher stance on China in response.\n\nKennedy of CSIS says business leaders express a range of opinions, depending on how much they discrimination they face in China and how key Chinese profits are to their business. \"I've heard folks say, 'It's not going well, but a trade war would not be the best thing for us, dialogue is the better path.' And there are others who say, 'Bring it on,'\" he said.", "time": "18:33:00"}

But that clearly isn't enough for Trump, who has come to believe that China simply isn't willing to take a more aggressive stance against North Korea, its main trading partner.\n\nMonday's announcement will mark the escalation of Trump's increasingly aggressive posture toward China. It comes after the Treasury Department earlier this summer announced sanctions against Chinese entities for their ties to North Korea.\n\nIn recent weeks, as North Korea tested intercontinental ballistic missiles, Trump has raged behind the scenes and in public, urged on by China hawks in his administration like trade adviser Peter Navarro and chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nBannon has increasingly focused on China, and he has argued that hitting China hard on trade is one way to get a handle on the North Korea threat.\n\n\"Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!\" Trump wrote on Twitter last month.\n\nTrump's tweet is a sharp contrast from what he told The Wall Street Journal in April after meeting with Xi. After Trump asserted China could easily eliminate the threat of North Korea, Xi persuaded him it isn't that simple\n\n\"After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it's not so easy,\" Trump told the Journal, recounting his conversation with Xi. \"I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power\" over North Korea, he added. \"But it's not what you would think.\"\n\nTrump often internalizes the perspective of the most recent person he speaks with -- one possible explanation for his comments to the Journal. Aides said Trump now firmly believes China isn't using its influence with North Korea to descalate the situation in North Korea. They also dismiss the notion that Trump was naive to try to win over Xi at Mar-a-Lago, adding that administration officials were always planning alternative options in case the Trump-Xi relationship soured.\n\nBut for all Trump's China talk, outside experts say the administration has yet to publicly outline a cohesive, wide-ranging China strategy.\n\n\"I don't think there's really been a whole-of-government approach to deal with China,\" said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where she focuses on China.\n\nGlasser noted that the White House has yet to name permanent leaders of several key China-related positions across the government. The State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and the Defense Department's Asian and Pacific Security Affairs arm, are currently run by acting officials because Trump has not yet nominated anybody to fill the positions.\n\nTrump has repeatedly pressured China to crack down on North Korea. Aides said Trump was enraged after North Korea tested another ballistic missile last month that experts said could potentially hit the U.S. mainland.\n\nChristopher Hill, the former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and the former head of the State Department's East Asia bureau during the George W. Bush administration, said Trump can't \"outsource\" the U.S.'s problems with North Korea to the Chinese.\n\n\"I think he had some notion that he could have a grand bargain for somehow China solving North Korea,\" Hill said. \"There needs to be a much more comprehensive effort to sit down with the Chinese, scope out the landscape and lay out what the Korean peninsula might look like in a unified way.\"\n\nTrump is expected to travel to China later this year, possibly in November when he will attend a trio of summits in Vietnam and the Philippines. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have also been invited to China..\n\nBut in the meantime, Trump's trade announcement on Monday could further heighten tension between China and the United States.\n\nTrump will urge U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to open an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, according to administration sources.. If the investigation finds evidence of unfair trade practices, the administration could begin the process of imposing duties on China.\n\nThe investigation is the first step in the administration's trade-related counter-attack on China. Senior administration officials have been meeting every Tuesday for more than three months to debate a slew of trade policies, and China has often been a central focus of the discussion.\n\nAfter weeks of infighting over the possibility of imposing tariffs on steel imports, Trump's advisers found a rare point of consensus in the 301 investigation. One administration official said few senior Trump adviser disagreed with the approach, despite some initial \"robust\" debate about the issue.\n\n\"Instead of going to those meetings and having a food fight about steel tariffs, we wanted a more proactive, consensus-driven trade policy,\" the administration official said.", "time": "12:48:00"}

property Jackie Calmes\n\nPresident Trump on Monday will start a process that could lead to action against China's alleged theft of American businesses' intellectual property, even as he seeks Beijing's help against nuclear threats from North Korea.\n\nSeveral administration officials outlined the highly preliminary trade action to reporters on Saturday, suggesting -- contrary to Trump's own statements -- that trade policy toward China is divorced from any national security concern, including North Korea.\n\n\"Trade is trade, national security is national security,\" said one official, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with administration practice.\n\nAs recently as Thursday, the president volunteered a connection between the two, and not for the first time, in remarks to reporters about his weeklong nuclear standoff with North Korea. Trump suggested that if China helped rein in North Korea, which is reliant on Beijing's economic and security aid, he could lighten up on his attacks on Chinese trade practices, which were a mainstay of his election campaign.\n\n\"We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel. It's not going to continue like that,\" Trump said from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. \"But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade -- a lot differently toward trade.\"\n\nThe officials would not confirm reports that the trade action Trump plans to initiate on Monday had been delayed more than a week, until the administration secured China's support last week to win a unanimous vote in the United Nations Security Council for imposing new sanctions on North Korea.\n\nThe president's trade action will be a long way from any punitive move against China, despite his and his advisors' open talk of Chinese \"theft\" and \"stealing\" of U.S. companies' intellectual property, which broadly includes technological innovations, film and other artistic products, industrial designs and military secrets.\n\nHe simply will initiate the latest investigation of intellectual property theft in a long line of them running back through past administrations.\n\nAccording to the Trump advisors, on Monday the president plans to sign an executive memorandum, which is a step below an executive order, directing trade officials to investigate China's \"acts, policies or practices\" that violate international protections for American intellectual property, innovations and technology.\n\nAs a prime example of what the officials called China's \"unfair trade practices,\" they objected that the country requires American businesses which want to operate there to form joint ventures with state-run companies and share intellectual property with them.\n\nThe American companies \"should not be forced or coerced to turn over the fruits of their labor,\" one official said.\n\nThe investigation could take as much as a year, another official said. The advisors did not speculate about further actions which might result, such as tariffs on imports from China or a formal complaint and appeal for sanctions to the World Trade Organization.\n\n\"We're at the beginning\" of a long process, an advisor said.\n\nLatest updates Copyright \u00a9 2017, Los Angeles Times", "time": "18:37:00"}

investigation into Chinese intellectual property violations that could result in severe trade penalties, a threat the United States could wield to pressure Beijing into improving its economic behavior and doing more to contain North Korea's nuclear threat.\n\nThe president plans to sign an executive memorandum Monday afternoon directing his top trade negotiator to determine whether to investigate China for harming intellectual property, innovation and technology, senior administration officials said in a conference call Saturday morning.\n\nThe measure would seek to address what the U.S. business community has described as flagrant trade violations by China, which employs a variety of rules and practices to wall its market off from foreign competition and pressure U.S. companies to part with valuable product designs and trade secrets - or to steal them outright.\n\nThe investigation could take as long as a year, U.S. officials said. In the meantime, it may help to satisfy President Donald Trump's political promises to get tougher on countries that cheat the United States economically, following a series of setbacks and delays on ambitious trade measures floated by the administration in past months.\n\nIt may also prove to be a source of leverage to push China to do more to help contain a rising security threat from North Korea, which counts Beijing as its only powerful ally.\n\nYet analysts said the measure could also backfire, resulting in more hostility and tension between the world's two largest economies at a time when their cooperation is critical to a diplomatic resolution on North Korea.\n\n\"The [U.S.-China] relationship could spiral out of control, particularly if the movement on the trade front is combined with growing tensions over how to respond to North Korea,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nInternational tensions have escalated as Trump and North Korean President Kim Jung Un traded threats of nuclear war in recent days. Trump tweeted Friday that military solutions are \"locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.\"\n\nIn a call Friday, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed that North Korea must stop its \"provocative and escalatory behavior\" and reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, the White House said.\n\nOn Saturday, administration officials said the new trade measure was \"totally unrelated\" to events with North Korea. They added that the trade measure would be carried out under the rules of international law and would not trigger greater conflict with China. But trade and national security experts widely noted that the trade announcement appeared to have been delayed until after China joined the United States in voting for sanction against North Korea at a United Nations Security Council session on Aug. 5.\n\nWhen asked about the delay in the call on Saturday, the officials did not address the question directly. They said that U.S. companies had long suffered because of Chinese intellectual property violations, and that they expected Congress and the business community to support the measure.\n\n\"If Americans continue to have their best technology and intellectual property stolen, or forcibly transferred offshore, the United States will find it difficult to maintain its current technology leadership position and to remain one of the world's most innovative economies. This is why the president has chosen to act now and to act boldly,\" one administration official said.\n\nMichael Wessel, a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, called the measure \"a critical action, and long overdue.\" \"China's been engaged in the theft and forced transfer of U.S. technologies and intellectual property for years. Those activities haven't abated; they've accelerated as China seeks to become self-sufficient in new technologies and dominate world markets,\" he said.\n\nIf the investigation finds that China is harming U.S. companies, the Trump administration could respond by imposing tariffs, negotiating an agreement with China, or other measures, the officials said.\n\nThe administration is likely eager to make progress on trade, one of Trump's biggest campaign issues, after a recent series of legislative setbacks, trade experts said. While Trump officially withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era trade deal, and will begin talks next week to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, other planned trade measures have been slow to materialize.\n\nThe results of three separate investigations into trade deficits and the national security threats posed by imports of steel and aluminum, initially expected by the end of June, have yet to appear. Meanwhile, 100 days of trade talks with the Chinese carried out in past months resulted in a few trade gains but not the ambitious changes the administration had hoped for.\n\nTrade experts and business leaders said the new investigation into intellectual property could be a sign that the trade agenda is shifting into the hands of United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a respected negotiator who helped implement some of the most protectionist trade policies of recent decades during the Reagan administration.\n\nLike the president, Lighthizer has criticized multilateral venues like the World Trade Organization for failing to provide adequate tools to address China's economic violations. Instead, he is leading the administration is dusting off a variety of powerful and unilateral measures under U.S. trade law, many of which the United States stopped using after the creation of the WTO, which has its own mechanisms to settle trade disputes.\n\nIn the conference call, officials did not rule out working with the WTO or other countries to penalize Chinese intellectual property violations, saying that the portions of U.S. trade law they are relying on, Sections 301 and 302 of the 1974 trade law, allow them to take a broad range of actions.\n\nThe United States has previously complained at the WTO about Chinese trade policies, including its \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, which seeks to have Chinese-made materials account for 70 percent of manufacturing inputs within the next eight years. That initiative sets forth a long-term plan for China's dominance in a wide variety of high-tech industries, including electric vehicles, advanced medial products and robotics.\n\nMeanwhile, China has continued to maintain barriers that prevent U.S. companies from accessing its market, while adding new requirements for U.S. companies to share technology with the Chinese state, like a recent cybersecurity law.\n\nThe U.S. business community, which traditionally lobbied U.S. administrations to take a softer approach toward Beijing to protect access to a profitable market, has shifted toward a tougher stance on China in response.\n\nKennedy of CSIS says business leaders express a range of opinions, depending on how much they discrimination they face in China and how key Chinese profits are to their business. \"I've heard folks say, 'It's not going well, but a trade war would not be the best thing for us, dialogue is the better path.' And there are others who say, 'Bring it on,'\" he said.", "time": "22:16:00"}

adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, senior administration officials said on Saturday.\n\nThe move, which could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods, comes at a time when Trump has asked China to do more to crack down on North Korea's nuclear missile program as he threatens possible military action against Pyongyang.\n\nTrump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.\n\nAn administration official, however, insisted diplomacy over North Korea and the potential trade probe were \"totally unrelated,\" saying the trade action was not a pressure tactic.\n\n\"These are two different things,\" the official said, speaking to reporters on a conference call.\n\nTrump will direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine if an investigation is warranted of \"any of China's laws, policies, practices or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory, and that may be harming American intellectual property, innovation and technology,\" the official said.\n\n\"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies, including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, harm the U.S. economy and workers,\" a second official told reporters. \"The action being taken on Monday is a reflection of the president's firm commitment to addressing this problem in a firm way.\"\n\nAny investigation that may be launched could take as long as a year to conclude, a third official said. He said it would be premature to speculate on actions that could eventually be taken against China, and added that the issue could be resolved through \"negotiated agreement.\"\n\nTrump, who will interrupt a 17-day working vacation to make a day trip to Washington for the trade announcement, had been expected to seek a so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this month, but an announcement was postponed as the White House pressed for China's cooperation on North Korea.\n\nWhile China joined in a unanimous U.N. Security Council decision to tighten economic sanctions on Pyongyang, Trump has kept up pressure on Beijing to do more.\n\n\"We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"If China helps us, I feel a lot different toward trade.\"\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone on Friday and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, the White House said in a statement. It was unclear whether the issue of trade came up.\n\nSection 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries from \"unfair trade practices\" of foreign countries.\n\nThe process can bypass World Trade Organization procedures for adjudicating grievances. Though widely used worldwide, the WTO process is viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're at the beginning of this process and no firm decisions have been made as to how that is going to work in terms of whether we would pursue WTO action or action outside the WTO,\" the first administration official said.\n\nIn addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern about Chinese theft of intellectual property. The technology sector has been especially hard-hit in intellectual property disputes. (Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Sandra Maler)", "time": "18:40:00"}

Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order to probe China's \"unfair\" trade practices that harm American businesses and have an impact on its intellectual properties, a senior official said today.\n\nTrump, currently on a 17-day working summer vacation at his golf resort in New Jersey, is returning to the White House for a day on Monday to sign this executive order directing the US Trade Representative to probe the matter.\n\nTrump's latest move does not mean any immediate sanctions on China as is being reported by some media outlets, but might lead to one at the end of the investigation which could take as long as a year.\n\n\"The President would sign an executive memorandum that directs the US Trade Representatives (USTR) Robert Lighthizer to determine if it is consistent whether to investigate any of China's laws, policies, practices or actions that make unreasonable or discriminatory or may be harming American intellectual property, innovation of technology,\" a senior administration official told reporters.\n\nThe official said Trump informed Chinese President Xi Jinping about his executive order during their phone call last night.\n\nThe investigation is being ordered under US Trade Act of 1974, which officials said permits the USTR to investigate acts, policies or practices of a foreign country to determine whether they are indeed unreasonable or discriminatory that burden or otherwise restrict US commerce.\n\n\"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft harm the US economy and its workers,\" a second administration official said.\n\nThe Chinese policies of an American company to enter into a join venture with a Chinese company to do business is \"not fair\", the official said.\n\nIn addition to this joint venture they are asked to turn over intellectual property or other propriety information.\n\n\"This is simply not fair,\" said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAmerican companies \"should not be forced or coerced to turn over the fruits of their labour,\" the official said, adding that the cost of intellectual theft on US economy is estimated to be as high as USD 600 billion a year.\n\n\"China is widely recognised as the biggest source of the problem,\" he said.\n\nSuch thefts not only damage American companies, but also pose a threat to the US national security, the second official said.\n\n\"President Trump is committed to protect America's intellectual property and national security,\" the official said.\n\nAccording to a third senior administration official, these investigations could take as much as a year before the US Trade Representative could come out with its determination.\n\nThe process among other things include hearing and giving the Chinese an opportunity to present their point of view.\n\n\"Most Americans feel that China is stealing our intellectual property. But they may not know that China is forcing and coercing American companies that operate in China to turn over their technology. China's forced technology transfer is highly institutionalised,\" the official said.\n\nResponding to a question, a senior administration official said many other countries are facing similar problem with respect to China.", "time": "06:15:00"}

The official said a decision had not been taken in that regard and offered no timelines.\n\nAsked if this could lead to a period of \"greater conflict\" with China, which could retaliate triggering a trade war, the official said he doesn't \"believe\" it would. \"This is just business\".\n\nAnd the administration strenuously pushed back against any suggestion it was related to spiraling tensions with North Korea, and the perceived failure of China, its chief protector, to rein it in. The two issues were unrelated -- \"trade is trade, national security is national security\", the official said.\n\nA trade sanctions against China had long been in the making, consistent with Trump's election promises of cutting America's ballooning trade deficit with China and punish the Asian nation for unfair trade practices such as artificially keeping its currency depressed to boost exports.\n\nBut here was a perception that it had been delayed because Trump was hoping China would do more on North Korea, and he had even suggested as much.\n\nIt was also said to have been put off to obtain China's support for the US-sponsored UN Security Council resolution slapping new sanctions on North Korea, which passed unanimously, subsequently.\n\nThe United States estimates theft of intellectual property costs the American economy $600 billion a year, and says China was a major contributor, employing unfair trade practices and industrial policies such as \"forced technology transfer\".\n\n\"All too often,\" the official said, \"American companies are forced to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies if they want to do business in China. This is not fair.\"\n\nIn addition, the official added, \"as part of these joint ventures, they have to turn over their intellectual and other proprietary information -- again, this is simply not fair\".", "time": "10:10:00"}

administration officials today outlined the White House's plan to pressure China over policies that \"force or coerce\" American companies to hand over valuable technology to do business there -- but they denied the effort was motivated by the crisis over North Korea.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is slated to take a break from his New Jersey vacation to return to Washington on Monday to announce an executive action that could lead to an investigation over alleged violations of U.S. intellectual property rights. The move delays for as long as a year any decision on actions that could stem from a probe, such as U.S. tariff increases or other punishing unilateral actions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the high-profile announcement the administration is planning carries symbolic as well as practical ramifications, and serves to ratchet up trade pressure on Beijing amid a deepening foreign policy crisis. Trump has responded in bellicose terms over the progress of North Korea's nuclear missile program and threats to launch an attack on the U.S. territory of Guam, where the U.S. has a military installation.\n\nDuring a media briefing on Saturday, administration officials rebutted the suggestion the trade action was intended to pressure China -- North Korea's main trading partner and economic lifeline -- to do more to rein in Pyongyang, even though Trump himself has said he would go easier on trade concerns with Beijing if they agreed to help put the squeeze on North Korea.\n\n\"These are totally unrelated events,\" a senior administration official told reporters. \"Trade is trade. National security is national security. All parts of this administration, within the White House and the Cabinet agencies, are fully engaged on this issue and fully united on this issue.\"\n\nBut as the North Korea crisis began to dominate headlines earlier this week, Trump fueled the impression that how hard he pressures Beijing on trade depends on its cooperation on the North Korea question. \"I think China can do a lot more\" to help curb North Korea, \"and I think China will do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., on Thursday. \"If China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade.\"\n\nAdditional evidence of a connection between the trade action and the North Korea crisis comes from the fact the executive memorandum Trump will sign on Monday was originally expected more than a week ago. It was apparently put on hold while the U.S. lobbied China and other U.N. Security Council members to impose new sanctions on North Korea. That effort passed by a 15-0 vote.\n\nTrump's trade action reflects his frustration that the U.S. and China were not able to make more progress on U.S. intellectual property concerns as part of the so-called 100-day plan to improve trade between the two countries -- a period that ended earlier this summer -- as well as during high-level talks last month in Washington, the administration official said.\n\nBut, the official added: \"I don't think we're headed toward a period of greater conflict. This is simply business between two countries.\"\n\nTrump's order will initiate a two-stage process for confronting China over a variety of \"laws, policies, practices or actions\" that require American companies to transfer valuable technology or other proprietary information to get permission to do business in China.\n\nAmerican companies \"should not be forced or coerced to turn over the fruits of their labor,\" a second administration official said. \"The current trajectory is unsustainable. Innovation in the U.S. economy should not be put at risk by policies that force companies to turn over their proprietary technologies and intellectual property.\"\n\nThe executive memorandum will also target trade-secret theft, which costs the U.S. economy as much as $600 billion a year, the second administration official said. \"China is widely recognized to be the biggest source of the problem,\" the official added.\n\nTrump's memo will highlight those concerns, but leave it to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine whether to launch an investigation -- a move that is seen as giving the administration more time to cajole China and gather support from the business community and other trading partners for any eventual action.\n\nShould Lighthizer decide to launch such an investigation, \"he will have at his discretion broad powers to use all applicable measures, including, but not limited to, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which provides a basis for addressing technology transfer practices that may be harming the U.S. economy, exports and American jobs,\" an administration official said.\n\nThe Section 301 provision is a powerful trade tool that has not been used in recent years. It allows an industry to ask USTR to investigate whether a foreign country is unfairly restricting its sales and to use the threat of sanctions to reach a negotiated settlement. It also allows USTR to self-initiate an investigation, but once a probe is launched a clock starts ticking that requires action within a year.\n\nLighthizer is well versed in Section 301 from his stint as deputy USTR in the Ronald Reagan administration, when it was more frequently used. However, the U.S. pledged in the mid-1990s to settle disputes through the World Trade Organization dispute settlement system rather than by taking unilateral action.\n\nAdministration officials emphasized Saturday that they are a long way from deciding what, if any, action to take if a Section 301 is launched and finds that China has engaged in unfair trade practices.\n\nThere are \"a wide variety of potential responses. There could be tariffs, there could be some sort of negotiated settlement, there could be a number of other things that are out there -- and, obviously, we haven't made any decision on that at this point,\" a third administration official said.\n\nAny investigation could take as long as a year once it is formally launched, and will likely include a public comment period and a hearing, the official said. The administration could also decide to use the information gathered in a Section 301 probe to file a case against China at the World Trade Organization, rather than acting unilaterally, the official added.\n\n\"An important question going forward will be whether U.S. companies and trade associations who have highlighted the problem will actually come forward and assist our government in the investigation,\" said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a watchdog group established by Congress.\n\nIt is possible that affected U.S. companies \"will hide the facts, fearful that our government won't follow through, that the Chinese will retaliate against their interests or that they'll have to admit what's happened to their critical assets,\" Wessel added. \"The time has come to say enough is enough -- and this action is a vital first step in that effort.\"\n\nAdministration officials said they expected support from both the business community and Congress for the action, and hope to get cooperation from other countries whose companies face the same problems in China.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has already urged Lighthizer to launch an investigation of China's forced technology practices. \"The administration has been unable to make progress on these issues in dialogues with China, including as part of the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue,\" Wyden said previously.", "time": "21:06:00"}

steps up economic pressure on Beijing with probe into trade and copyright practices\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to launch a crackdown on China Monday by announcing an investigation into the country's trade practices and allegations that China violated U.S. intellectual property rights, U.S. officials told multiple outlets Friday and Saturday.\n\nOn Friday, Trump called his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, to warn him that the U.S. will conduct an investigation into China's trade practices with the U.S., a senior administration official told CNN. Trump plans to order U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to launch the probe Monday with the goal of identifying unfair trade practices that have places the U.S. at a severe economic and financial disadvantage.\n\nThe probe, which will rely upon Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and could result in steep tariffs, will begin as U.S. tensions with North Korea continue to escalate while Trump pressures the Chinese to exert their influence over North Korea and its nuclear missile program.\n\n\"The United States government can, and does, work with countries to address serious concerns such as North Korea while also pursuing measures to address economic concerns, such as the theft of U.S. intellectual property,\" a U.S. National Security Council official told CNN.\n\nTrump has been walking along a tenuous tightrope with China ever since he hosted Jinping at Mar-a-Lago in April. All throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump railed against \"disastrous\" trade deals and specifically called out China for its unfair trade practices that have left the U.S. at a disadvantage. Advocating for a level playing field that treats the U.S. fairly while energizing the U.S. economy, Trump sought to reset the relationship between the two countries while simultaneously attempting to convince China to exert more pressure on North Korea. As a result, the U.S. president's trade rhetoric softened considerably.\n\nChina, which is North Korea's foremost trading partner, provided the rogue nation with a crucial crutch as it escalated its nuclear missile program and took a more aggressive stance against the U.S. and other leading nations. Although the U.S. would like to remain on productive terms with China and see it wield its economic influence over North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong-un, Trump also wants to end China's unfair trade practices and implement his \"America first\" agenda.\n\n\"I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet ... they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!\" Trump tweeted back in late July.\n\n\"Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk,\" Trump also tweeted in July. \"We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!\"\n\nBut in early August, China voted with the rest of the United Nations Security Council in a significant step forward to impose strict sanctions on North Korea, much to Trump's delight.\n\n\"The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!\" Trump tweeted August 5. \"United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K.\"\n\nAs the North Korean threat looms on the horizon, Trump will continue to balance his request that China exert its influence over Jong-un with holding China accountable for its unfair trade practices and copyright infringements. And as Trump told reporters on Thursday, \"China can do a lot more\" and China \"will do a lot more.\"\n\nChina expert, author and columnist Gordon Chang said Wednesday on \"The Laura Ingraham Show\" that the U.S. needs \"to start asking Beijing some pointed questions -- and not only behind the scenes, but also in public because the American public needs to hear this,\" noting that the U.S. has \"the leverage\" necessary to persuade China to tame North Korea.\n\n\"We hold most of the high cards,\" Chang said, adding that Trump must tell the Chinese \"that they have to stop their duplicitous game that they've been engaged in now for a couple decades and actually start to help the United States.\"\n\n(photo credit, homepage image: Lance Cheung; photo credit, article image: D.

"http://www.politico.eu/article/white-house-details-plan-to-ratchet-up-trade-pressure-on-china/", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Senior administration officials on Saturday outlined the White House's plan to pressure China over policies that \"force or coerce\" American companies to hand over valuable technology to do business there -- but they denied the effort was motivated by the crisis over North Korea.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is slated to take a break from his New Jersey vacation to return to Washington on Monday to announce an executive action that could lead to an investigation over alleged violations of U.S. intellectual property rights. The move delays for as long as a year any decision on actions that could stem from a probe, such as U.S. tariff increases or other punishing unilateral actions.\n\nBut the high-profile announcement the administration is planning carries symbolic as well as practical ramifications, and serves to ratchet up trade pressure on Beijing amid a deepening foreign policy crisis. Trump has responded in bellicose terms over the progress of North Korea's nuclear missile program and threats to launch an attack on the U.S. territory of Guam, where the U.S. has a military installation.\n\nDuring a media briefing on Saturday, administration officials rebutted the suggestion the trade action was intended to pressure China -- North Korea's main trading partner and economic lifeline -- to do more to rein in Pyongyang, even though Trump himself has said he would go easier on trade concerns with Beijing if they agreed to help put the squeeze on North Korea.\n\nTrump fueled the impression that how hard he pressures Beijing on trade depends on its cooperation on the North Korea question.\n\n\"These are totally unrelated events,\" a senior administration official told reporters. \"Trade is trade. National security is national security. All parts of this administration, within the White House and the Cabinet agencies, are fully engaged on this issue and fully united on this issue.\"\n\nBut as the North Korea crisis began to dominate headlines earlier this week, Trump fueled the impression that how hard he pressures Beijing on trade depends on its cooperation on the North Korea question. \"I think China can do a lot more\" to help curb North Korea, \"and I think China will do a lot more,\" Trump told reporters at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., on Thursday. \"If China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade.\"\n\nAdditional evidence of a connection between the trade action and the North Korea crisis comes from the fact the executive memorandum Trump will sign on Monday was originally expected more than a week ago. It was apparently put on hold while the U.S. lobbied China and other U.N. Security Council members to impose new sanctions on North Korea. That effort passed by a 15-0 vote.\n\nTrump's trade action reflects his frustration that the U.S. and China were not able to make more progress on U.S. intellectual property concerns as part of the so-called 100-day plan to improve trade between the two countries -- a period that ended earlier this summer -- as well as during high-level talks last month in Washington, the administration official said.\n\nBut, the official added: \"I don't think we're headed toward a period of greater conflict. This is simply business between two countries.\"\n\nTrump's order will initiate a two-stage process for confronting China over a variety of \"laws, policies, practices or actions\" that require American companies to transfer valuable technology or other proprietary information to get permission to do business in China.\n\n\"The current trajectory is unsustainable\" -- administration official\n\nAmerican companies \"should not be forced or coerced to turn over the fruits of their labor,\" a second administration official said. \"The current trajectory is unsustainable. Innovation in the U.S. economy should not be put at risk by policies that force companies to turn over their proprietary technologies and intellectual property.\"\n\nThe executive memorandum will also target trade-secret theft, which costs the U.S. economy as much as $600 billion a year, the second administration official said. \"China is widely recognized to be the biggest source of the problem,\" the official added.\n\nTrump's memo will highlight those concerns, but leave it to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine whether to launch an investigation -- a move that is seen as giving the administration more time to cajole China and gather support from the business community and other trading partners for any eventual action.\n\nShould Lighthizer decide to launch such an investigation, \"he will have at his discretion broad powers to use all applicable measures, including, but not limited to, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which provides a basis for addressing technology transfer practices that may be harming the U.S. economy, exports and American jobs,\" an administration official said.\n\nThe Section 301 provision is a powerful trade tool that has not been used in recent years. It allows an industry to ask USTR to investigate whether a foreign country is unfairly restricting its sales and to use the threat of sanctions to reach a negotiated settlement. It also allows USTR to self-initiate an investigation, but once a probe is launched a clock starts ticking that requires action within a year.\n\nLighthizer is well versed in Section 301 from his stint as deputy USTR in the Ronald Reagan administration, when it was more frequently used. However, the U.S. pledged in the mid-1990s to settle disputes through the World Trade Organization dispute settlement system rather than by taking unilateral action.\n\n\"An important question going forward will be whether U.S. companies and trade associations who have highlighted the problem will actually come forward and assist our government in the investigation\" -- Michael Wessel, member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\n\nAdministration officials emphasized Saturday that they are a long way from deciding what, if any, action to take if a Section 301 is launched and finds that China has engaged in unfair trade practices.\n\nThere are \"a wide variety of potential responses. There could be tariffs, there could be some sort of negotiated settlement, there could be a number of other things that are out there -- and, obviously, we haven't made any decision on that at this point,\" a third administration official said.\n\nAny investigation could take as long as a year once it is formally launched, and will likely include a public comment period and a hearing, the official said. The administration could also decide to use the information gathered in a Section 301 probe to file a case against China at the World Trade Organization, rather than acting unilaterally, the official added.\n\n\"An important question going forward will be whether U.S. companies and trade associations who have highlighted the problem will actually come forward and assist our government in the investigation,\" said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a watchdog group established by Congress.\n\nIt is possible that affected U.S. companies \"will hide the facts, fearful that our government won't follow through, that the Chinese will retaliate against their interests or that they'll have to admit what's happened to their critical assets,\" Wessel added. \"The time has come to say enough is enough -- and this action is a vital first step in that effort.\"\n\nAdministration officials said they expected support from both the business community and Congress for the action, and hope to get cooperation from other countries whose companies face the same problems in China.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has already urged Lighthizer to launch an investigation of China's forced technology practices. \"The administration has been unable to make progress on these issues in dialogues with China, including as part of the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue,\" Wyden said previously.", "time": "08:29:00"}

Xi sought to lower the temperature after Trump's vow to rain down \"fire and fury\" on North Korea, urging restraint and a political solution.\n\nBut the conversation came as Trump's administration was preparing new trade action against China that could inflame the relationship. Trump plans to return to Washington on Monday to sign a memo determining whether China should be investigated for intellectual property violations, accusing Beijing of failing to curb the theft of trade secrets and rampant online and physical piracy and counterfeiting. An investigation would be intended to lead to retaliatory measures.\n\nThe White House had planned to take action on intellectual property earlier but held off as it successfully lobbied China to vote at the U.N. Security Council for additional sanctions on North Korea a week ago. Even now, the extra step of determining whether to start the investigation is less than trade hawks might have wanted, but softens the blow to China and gives Trump a cudgel to hold over it if he does not get the cooperation he wants.\n\nWhile past presidents have tried at least ostensibly to keep security and economic issues on separate tracks in their dealings with China, Trump has explicitly linked the two, suggesting he would back off from a trade war against Beijing if it does more to pressure North Korea. \"If China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade, a lot differently toward trade,\" he told reporters Thursday.\n\nTrump has sought to leverage trade and North Korea with China for months, initially expressing optimism after hosting Xi at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, only to later grow discouraged that Beijing was not following through. The effort has reached a decisive point with the overt threats of U.S. military action against North Korea -- warnings clearly meant for Beijing's ears.\n\nChina is widely seen as critical to any resolution to the nuclear crisis because of its outsize role as North Korea's main economic benefactor. China accounts for as much as 90 percent of North Korea's total trade and supplies most of its food and energy while serving as the primary purchaser of its minerals, seafood and garments.\n\nBut even though the effectiveness of the new U.N. sanctions depends largely on China's willingness to enforce them, the Trump administration has failed to come up with enough incentives to compel China to do so, analysts said.\n\nIn their phone conversation Friday night, Xi stressed that it was \"very important\" for the two leaders to maintain contact to find \"an appropriate solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula,\" according to a statement carried in the Chinese state-run media. The language indicated China wants to push forward with a diplomatic proposal for North Korea that the Trump administration has brushed aside.\n\n17946765", "time": "06:28:00"}

Though widely used worldwide, the WTO process is viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration.\n\nThe imposition of tariffs and other non-tariff trade barriers \"will not solve America's economic problems and probably in the long term will make it worse,\" Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a leading China expert, told Xinhua news agency in a recent interview.", "time": "16:59:00"}

probe China's \"unfair\" trade practices that harm American businesses and have an impact on its intellectual properties, a senior official said.\n\nTrump, currently on a 17-day working summer vacation at his golf resort in New Jersey, is returning to the White House for a day on Monday to sign this executive order directing the US Trade Representative to probe the matter. Trump's latest move does not mean any immediate sanctions on China as is being reported by some media outlets, but might lead to one at the end of the investigation which could take as long as a year. \"The President would sign an executive memorandum that directs the US Trade Representatives (USTR) Robert Lighthizer to determine if it is consistent whether to investigate any of China's laws, policies, practices or actions that make unreasonable or discriminatory or may be harming American intellectual property, innovation of technology,\" a senior administration official told reporters.\n\nThe official said Trump informed Chinese President Xi Jinping about his executive order during their phone call last night. The investigation is being ordered under US Trade Act of 1974, which officials said permits the USTR to investigate acts, policies or practices of a foreign country to determine whether they are indeed unreasonable or discriminatory that burden or otherwise restrict US commerce. \"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft harm the US economy and its workers,\" a second administration official said. The Chinese policies of an American company to enter into a join venture with a Chinese company to do business is \"not fair\", the official said. In addition to this joint venture they are asked to turn over intellectual property or other propriety information.\n\n\"This is simply not fair,\" said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. American companies \"should not be forced or coerced to turn over the fruits of their labour,\" the official said, adding that the cost of intellectual theft on US economy is estimated to be as high as USD 600 billion a year. \"China is widely recognised as the biggest source of the problem,\" he said.\n\nSuch thefts not only damage American companies, but also pose a threat to the US national security, the second official said. \"President Trump is committed to protect America's intellectual property and national security,\" the official said.\n\nAccording to a third senior administration official, these investigations could take as much as a year before the US Trade Representative could come out with its determination. The process among other things include hearing and giving the Chinese an opportunity to present their point of view.\n\n\"Most Americans feel that China is stealing our intellectual property. But they may not know that China is forcing and coercing American companies that operate in China to turn over their technology. China's forced technology transfer is highly institutionalised,\" the official said. Responding to a question, a senior administration official said many other countries are facing similar problem with respect to China.", "time": "08:58:00"}

President Donald Trump. (File/Photo) Charlottesville violence tests Donald Trump's presidential mettleAfter Charlottesville violence, Barack Obama shared this subtle messageDonald Trump tells Emmanuel Macron: US ready to stop North Korean nuke menace\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order to probe China's \"unfair\" trade practices that harm American businesses and have an impact on its intellectual properties, a senior official said on Sunday. Trump, currently on a 17-day working summer vacation at his golf resort in New Jersey, is returning to the White House for a day on Monday to sign this executive order directing the US Trade Representative to probe the matter. Trump's latest move does not mean any immediate sanctions on China as is being reported by some media outlets, but might lead to one at the end of the investigation which could take as long as a year.\n\n\"The President would sign an executive memorandum that directs the US Trade Representatives (USTR) Robert Lighthizer to determine if it is consistent whether to investigate any of China's laws, policies, practices or actions that make unreasonable or discriminatory or may be harming American intellectual property, innovation of technology,\" a senior administration official told reporters.\n\nThe official said Trump informed Chinese President Xi Jinping about his executive order during their phone call last night.\n\nThe investigation is being ordered under US Trade Act of 1974, which officials said permits the USTR to investigate acts, policies or practices of a foreign country to determine whether they are indeed unreasonable or discriminatory that burden or otherwise restrict US commerce.\n\n\"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft harm the US economy and its workers,\" a second administration official said.\n\nThe Chinese policies of an American company to enter into a join venture with a Chinese company to do business is \"not fair\", the official said.\n\nIn addition to this joint venture they are asked to turn over intellectual property or other propriety information.\n\n\"This is simply not fair,\" said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAmerican companies \"should not be forced or coerced to turn over the fruits of their labour,\" the official said, adding that the cost of intellectual theft on US economy is estimated to be as high as USD 600 billion a year.\n\n\"China is widely recognised as the biggest source of the problem,\" he said.\n\nSuch thefts not only damage American companies, but also pose a threat to the US national security, the second official said.\n\n\"President Trump is committed to protect America's intellectual property and national security,\" the official said.\n\nAccording to a third senior administration official, these investigations could take as much as a year before the US Trade Representative could come out with its determination.\n\nThe process among other things include hearing and giving the Chinese an opportunity to present their point of view.\n\n\"Most Americans feel that China is stealing our intellectual property. But they may not know that China is forcing and coercing American companies that operate in China to turn over their technology. China's forced technology transfer is highly institutionalised,\" the official said.\n\nResponding to a question, a senior administration official said many other countries are facing similar problem with respect to China.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Chinese products donald trump", "time": "08:10:00"}

"body": "President to ask USTR to consider investigation, officials say\n\nPresident Donald Trump is stepping up pressure on China over what the U.S. perceives to be the theft of intellectual property, opening a new front of trade friction even as the world's largest economies try to work together to contain North Korea's nuclear threat.\n\nTrump will sign an executive memorandum on Monday directing U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider investigating China over its IP policies, especially the practice of forcing U.S. companies operating in China to transfer technological know-how, administration officials said Saturday on a conference call with reporters.\n\nIf China is found to be flouting the rules on U.S. intellectual property, the administration has a range of options, including imposing import tariffs, said the administration officials, who weren't authorized to speak publicly about the matter. If USTR moves forward, the investigation could take as long as a year.\n\nThe move comes amid growing tension over the threat of North Korea using nuclear weapons, and a week after the U.S. received China's help in the United Nations Security Council to impose tougher economic sanctions on Pyongyang. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, said at the time that she wanted to \"personally thank\" the Chinese delegation.\n\nThe U.S. Firms at Risk from China Trade War: QuickTake Scoreboard\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping moved to calm nerves on Friday, telling the U.S. president during a phone call that all sides should maintain restraint and avoid inflammatory comments. While the White House said the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons, Trump has previously criticized China for not reining in North Korea, and threatened trade measures if Xi fails to act.\n\nThe announcement expected Monday comes amid sharply escalating tensions, with Trump warning that U.S. military options are \"locked and loaded\" if North Korean President Kim Jong-Un acts unwisely.\n\nIt further complicates the already taut U.S.-China relationship, which took a frosty turn last month when officials from both nations couldn't agree on a joint statement over economic issues after high-level talks in Washington.\n\nStill, Trump's actions stop short of what some analysts had been expecting him to do on intellectual property. Rather than launching straight into a probe, USTR will merely consider whether to launch an investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.\n\nAdministration officials declined to say how long it will take before a decision is made whether to start a probe.\n\nU.S. officials also sought to downplay any link between the North Korea issue and the IP action, which they called a response to the long-standing irritant of China's lack of respect for American intellectual property.\n\nSection 301 allows the president to impose tariffs on foreign products in response to unfair or discriminatory restrictions on American commerce. The provision has fallen into disuse since the mid-1990s after the creation of the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe U.S. could file a trade complaint on IP with the WTO or take action outside the WTO process, one administration official said.\n\nIn a report to lawmakers released in July, the USTR accused China of engaging in \"widespread infringing activity, including trade secret theft, rampant online piracy and counterfeiting, and high levels of physical pirated and counterfeit exports to markets around the globe.\"\n\nEarlier this year, an independent commission on U.S. intellectual property estimated that the annual cost to the U.S. economy in counterfeit goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets from all sources exceeds $225 billion and could be as high as $600 billion. China is the world's principal IP infringer, the commission said.\n\nUSTR argues Beijing uses a range of practices to force U.S. companies to transfer IP, such as by granting regulatory approvals to drug makers that shift production to China or requiring that the designs of foreign products be replicable in China.\n\nTrump is expected to be in Washington on Monday, breaking into what he's termed a working vacation at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. The Chinese trade announcement is expected to be part of his agenda.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump twinned the issues of China's help with North Korea and the U.S.-China trade imbalance.\n\n\"We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel. It's not going to continue like that,\" he said. \"But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade.\"", "time": "19:27:00"}

Trump has accused China of failing to rein in the nuclear ambitions of its ally North Korea, even as he makes ever sharper threats against Pyongyang.\n\nThe officials said that matter, and the trade issue, are not linked.\n\nThe process Lighthizer will initiate, under Article 302b of the US Commercial Code, could take as long as a year to yield its findings.\n\nThe latest step follows the opening by the Trump administration of several other investigations into Chinese commercial practices, notably in the steel sector.\n\nOn Tuesday, Washington announced preliminary sanctions against imports of Chinese aluminum foil.\n\nThe US officials said \"Chinese commercial policy has a major goal, the acquisition and the absorption of the intellectual property of the United States and other countries around the world.\"\n\n\"Most Americans are fully aware that China is stealing our intellectual property,\" they added. \"What they may not know is that China is also forcing and coercing American companies that operate in China to turn over their technologies.\"\n\nJoint ventures under scrutiny\n\nUS officials will particularly examine the role of joint ventures, the mixed foreign-and-Chinese companies whose establishment is required for any outside business wishing to sell its products in China.\n\n\"China also funds and facilitates the acquisition of US firms that possess advanced technologies,\" the officials said.\n\n\"If Americans continue to have their best technologies and intellectual property stolen or forcibly transferred off-shore, the United States will find it difficult to maintain its current technology leadership position,\" they added.\n\nUS and European companies have long complained of Chinese rules that force them to turn over their industrial secrets if they wish to do business in China.\n\nApple, which has a turnover of more than $30 billion a year in China, is currently subject to several measures taken by Beijing that hinder its activities in the country.\n\nThe manufacturer of the iPhone was forced in late July to remove certain apps that would have allowed users to circumvent extensive online restrictions imposed by the Chinese government.\n\nAmong the other big names in US technology, Facebook and Google are currently sidelined in China. Though they are largely missing out on the giant consumer market, they also fear their technologies being stolen.\n\nAutomakers as well as aeronautical giants Boeing and Airbus have been able to enter China via joint ventures, even as the Chinese seek to penetrate global markets.", "time": "01:06:00"}

electric auto manufacturing, data security, internet censorship and other fields.\n\nTrump, who has been residing at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for the past week, plans to return to Washington on Monday to officially announce the trade investigation.\n\nYang said that before joining the WTO in 2002, Taiwan had been subjected to the Section 301 investigations because its trade regulations had not been aligned with global norms.\n\nThe administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. \"The previous three presidents were not able to find an adequate solution [to the North Korea crisis], so he can't be blamed for all this\".\n\n\"I think it's only fair to point out he inherited this crisis\", Mr. Gore told Newsweek. The investigation is being ordered under US Trade Act of 1974, which officials said permits the USTR to investigate acts, policies or practices of a foreign country to determine whether they are indeed unreasonable or discriminatory that burden or otherwise restrict US commerce.\n\nSeveral Twitter users have over the last 24 hours reported Trump's tweet, which threatened violence against North Korea. Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm.\n\nPresident Trump's pattern continues: \"Tough talk on China, but weaker action than anyone could ever imagine\", he said in a statement.\n\nThey added that the trade measure would be carried out under the rules of global law and would not trigger greater conflict with China. \"China is widely recognised as the biggest source of the problem\", he said. He said it would be premature to speculate on actions that could eventually be taken against China, and added that the issue could be resolved through \"negotiated agreement\".\n\n\"We would like to emphasize that the Chinese government has always attached importance to intellectual property protection\", a spokesman said.\n\n\"China's unfair trade practices and industrial policies including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft harm the United States economy and its workers\", a second administration official said.\n\nTrump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. American companies \"should not be forced or coerced to turn over the fruits of their labour\", the official said, adding that the cost of intellectual theft on USA economy is estimated to be as high as Dollars 600 billion a year.\n\nSimilarly, the president also asked for a review about whether steel and aluminium imports were jeopardizing national security.", "time": "12:46:00"}

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, bluntly accused China of \"stealing our intellectual property\" - long a concern of Western firms seeking a share of the enormous Chinese market.\n\nThe new measure comes amid high tensions between Washington and Beijing.

The officials said that matter, and the trade issue, are not linked.\n\nThe process Lighthizer will initiate, under Article 302b of the US Commercial Code, could take as long as a year to yield its findings.

The Trump administration is insisting the move isn't tied to heightening tensions with North Korea, but it is inherently connected to complications in the region.\n\n\"I don't think we're heading toward a period of greater conflict (with China),\" said one White House official. \"This is simply business.\"\n\nThe executive memo Trump is expected to sign on Monday will direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to look into whether his office should open an investigation into China's trade policies and whether they abide by the U.S. Trade Act of 1974.\n\nIt's impossible, however, to see the move as somehow disconnected from the back-and-forth rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea over the past week. Trump has previously expressed frustration that China hasn't done more to economically punish North Korea.\n\n\"I am very disappointed in China,\" he said on July 29 on Twitter. \"Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet ... they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk.\n\n\"We will no longer allow this to continue.\"\n\nAnd then on Thursday, when speaking with reporters, Trump said in relation to North Korea, \"if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade.\"\n\nThe title of the so-called \"301 investigation\" that Trump is expected to call for Lighthizer to consider, refers to Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes the president to work to remove or retaliate against a practice by a foreign government that is \"unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"\n\nIn a background briefing with reporters on Saturday, White House officials pointed to frustration from U.S. businesses that they have to share intellectual property with China as a condition for doing business in the country.\n\n\"Americans are among the most innovative,\" said one official. \"They should not be forced to turn over the fruits of their labor.\"\n\nDespite Trump's previous comments, officials at the briefing repeatedly rebuffed any attempt by reporters to connect the possible investigation to the North Korea situation.\n\nIt's unclear whether any actual repercussions for China, like sanctions or tariffs, would come from an investigation like this, and officials said there is no timeline for how long an investigation would take.\n\nBoth Reuters and CNN reported this week that Trump was planning to call for the investigation to be considered earlier this month but that the president waited until after a United Nations Security Council vote to impose new sanctions on North Korea. The vote passed with unanimous support from all 15 member nations, including Russia and China.\n\nCNN also reported that Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping about the expected executive action in a phone call on Friday. A White House communications staffer declined to confirm or deny the report on Saturday, instead pointing to a statement released by the White House on Friday describing the phone call.

administration has announced plans to pressure China over alleged intellectual property theft, adding the threat of trade retaliation to an ongoing campaign seeking greater co-operation from Beijing in the North Korean nuclear crisis.\n\nAides said President Donald Trump would sign a directive today ordering his trade representative to start a formal probe into whether Chinese government agencies and companies were unfairly acquiring valuable patents and licences from US firms, either through outright theft, or by pressuring Americans to turn over their inventions as the price of entry into China's market.\n\n\"Such theft not only damages American companies, but can threaten our national security,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nOfficials stressed that while they were casting a spotlight on what they consider a major irritant in bilateral commercial relations, they weren't rushing into action. They said the new directive would launch a study into whether a formal trade investigation was warranted, and that probe would take a year or more. They declined to discuss what sorts of penalties the US might impose against China, saying that question was \"premature\".\n\nThe administration made the announcement a day after Mr Trump held a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss escalating tensions over North Korea's rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program.\n\nMr Trump has repeatedly said he would cut Beijing slack over trade issues if he felt the Chinese were being helpful in reining in Pyongyang.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the month that a new trade investigation over China's alleged forced technology transfers was in the works and had been planned for an early August announcement. But that was delayed until after an August 5 UN Security Council vote imposing new financial penalties on North Korea, which China supported.\n\nAsked if Mr Trump discussed the pending trade investigation with Mr Xi on the weekend, an official pointed to the official White House summary of the call, which didn't mention trade issues.\n\nThe White House aides said the new trade probe wasn't tied to the administration's North Korea strategy, despite the President's earlier linkage of the subjects. \"These are totally unrelated events,\" one official said. \"Trade is trade. National security is national security.\"\n\nThe new probe does signal a bit of a hardening shift in the Trump administration's China trade policy, as it is the first White House trade directive aimed directly at Beijing. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr Trump regularly blasted the US's $US347 billion ($440bn) trade deficit with China, and vowed to take swift, drastic retaliation if he were elected, from across-the-board tariffs to branding Beijing a \"currency manipulator\".\n\nBut the early months of Mr Trump's presidency have seen a considerably softer tone toward China over trade. He quickly dropped the campaign-trail threats, and during a genial April summit with Mr Xi at his Mar-a-Lago Florida resort, the two countries launched a new \"comprehensive economic dialogue\" aimed at resolving bilateral commercial disputes amicably.\n\nA month later, China announced some modest market-opening moves, like ending a 14-year ban on US beef imports, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross declared economic ties between the world's two largest economies were \"hitting a new high\".\n\nBut the first round of economic dialogue talks in mid-July were tense and ended up with no agreements. Officials said that impasse was one factor behind the decision to launch the new trade review.\n\nIn focusing on China's voracious appetite for American intellectual property, the Trump administration is responding to a longstanding complaint by Western trade groups, who say the country's industrial policies effectively force foreign companies in sectors such as autos to transfer technology to stay in the market.\n\nBeijing has been emboldened by the growing strength of its own companies to make more demands of foreign firms, industry executives say, and the government is careful to keep regulations vague. US hi-tech companies have struck a string of investments and technology-sharing agreements in software, semiconductors and other areas in the past couple of years, often under pressure from officials in closed-door meetings.\n\nChina's government rejects assertions that it forces foreign companies to transfer technology or permits infringement of intellectual property.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang denied it was using industrial policies to strongarm foreign companies into turning over technology, telling a World Economic Forum meeting in Dalian in June that \"such co-operation is voluntary and helps companies expand in the Chinese market and even in third countries\".\n\nMajor US tech companies like Microsoft and Qualcomm have set up Chinese joint ventures in recent years that require them to share technology, in deals they call voluntary.\n\nThere have been some signs of conflict though. Microsoft announced this year the completion of a version of Windows 10 tailored for Chinese government use, a bid to sell to China's large state sector. But the product has yet to get Beijing's green light -- a reflection in part of disagreement over how much Microsoft must co-operate, according to sources.\n\nMicrosoft remains under a China anti-trust investigation.\n\nApple said last month that it would shift control over iCloud operation for Chinese customers to a local partner due to the country's new regulations.\n\nWhile many US companies and policymakers agree Chinese forced technology transfer is a problem, they also say it is difficult to figure out a solution.\n\nOne challenge is that many US firms are reluctant to lodge formal complaints, making it difficult for trade officials to make their case.\n\n\"An important question going forward will be whether US companies and trade associations who have highlighted the problem will actually come forward and assist our government in the investigation,\" said Michael Wessel, a member of the congressional US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.", "time": "14:01:00"}

intellectual property violations by China, a measure aimed at addressing complaints that the economic relationship between the world's two largest economies is stacked in Beijing's favour.\n\nTrump will sign an executive memorandum on Monday directing US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to investigate Chinese laws, policies, practises or actions that might be \"unreasonable or discriminatory\" to American technology and intellectual property, US senior administration officials told reporters in a teleconference from Washington.\n\nThe investigation will focus on a number of issues related to China's \"forceful transfer of technology\" and \"intellectual property theft\" towards foreign companies doing business in China, senior officials claimed on Saturday in a press teleconference, it's \"premature\" to decide the investigation's deadline, determination and enforcements.\n\nDid Trump back-pedal on plan to hit China with trade sanctions?\n\nUS senior officials added that the investigation could take as much as a year, and either lead to negotiating an agreement with China, US unilateral trade remedy actions or entering into dispute settlement process in the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe timing of the investigation is sensitive, given a steep escalation in military tensions between the US and North Korea, a traditional ally and trading partner with China.\n\nPyongyang and Washington have traded military threats since last Thursday when Trump warned North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that further threats by him would be \"met with fire and fury\".\n\nPyongyang responded Trump by announcing a intermediate-range missile strike plan near US Pacific island territory Guam.\n\nNorth Korea considers missile attack on Guam, after Trump vows 'fire and fury' over nuke report\n\nIn a phone call earlier this weekend, Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping \"agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behaviour\", according to a White House statement released after the phone call.\n\nIn the teleconference with reporters, administration officials said the North Korean issue and the trade investigation are \"totally unrelated\".\n\n\"I don't believe we are heading towards a period of great conflict. This is simply business between two countries,\" said a US senior administration official in the teleconference. The US and China had not reached an agreement to solve their longtime trade disputes during their Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in Washington in mid-July. Afterwards, speculation of a trade war between the two world's largest economies continued to spread.\n\nA US senior official explained that USTR will seek counsel with the appropriate advisors, and sought to play down the potential that such an investigation would damage relations with Beijing.\n\n\"If the investigation is instituted, we will consult with China, we will give interested parities opportunities to comment. There would likely be a hearing. And these investigations can take as much as year before we reach a conclusion,\" the official said.\n\nPressure from some US government bodies and business associations has been building for years, and has largely been a bipartisan issue in Washington.\n\nThe US Federal Trade Commission warned Congress about China's IP protection practices last year, after determining that efforts to advise Beijing to avoid opaque procedures with respect to its antitrust regulations had largely failed.\n\nTrump close to decision on China trade sanctions - source\n\n\"China's agencies are pursuing non-competition objectives through competition enforcement to promote either certain industries or particular Chinese competitors,\" the FTC said in a prepared statement to a subcommittee of the US House of Representatives in June 2016.\n\n\"We recognise that the pursuit of competition enforcement without procedural safeguards or based on opaque, non-competition standards undermines the legitimacy of antitrust enforcement around the world. Many of the concerns about IP-related antitrust enforcement have been focused on China,\" the FTC statement said.\n\nUnder the terms of China's entry into the World Trade Organisation in 2001, the country was allowed to limit foreign ownership of companies in key industries including telecommunications and auto manufacturing. These limitations forced many foreign companies into joint ventures with Chinese entities, many of them state-owned, effectively a form of technology transfer.\n\nThe US and China can beat the trade deficit with a treaty, not all-out war\n\nUS government negotiators agreed to these allowances because Chinese companies weren't competitive internationally at the time. US companies and government officials largely approved of these terms to gain access to Chinese markets.\n\nThe growth of companies like Huawei, now a global manufacturer of telecommunications networking equipment and a competitor to US companies like Qualcomm and Cisco, underscores how the 2001 scenario has changed.", "time": "20:39:00"}

investigate China for harming intellectual property, innovation and technology, senior administration officials said.\n\nMore World News Videos Previous slide Next slide Xi urges restraint in North

During that call, Trump and Xi agreed that North Korea must stop its \"provocative and escalatory behaviour\" and reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearising the Korean peninsula, according to a White House statement.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nXi urged President Trump to exercise restraint over tensions with North Korea during a phone call, Chinese state media reported. Xi urged both sides not to do anything that would aggravate tensions. Dialogue, negotiations and a political settlement are the fundamental ways of solving the Korean peninsula's nuclear issue, Xi said during the call, according to China's CGTN state television network.\n\n\"The Chinese leader expressed Beijing's willingness to maintain communication with the US to appropriately resolve the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue,\" the network reported. Xi \"stressed that China and the US share the same interests on the denuclearisation and peace on the Korean peninsula.\"\n\nOn Saturday, administration officials said the new trade measure was \"totally unrelated\" to events involving North Korea.\n\nThey added that the trade measure would be carried out under the rules of international law and would not trigger greater conflict with China.\n\nBut trade and national security experts widely noted that the announcement appeared to have been delayed until after China joined the United States in voting for sanctions against North Korea at a United Nations Security Council session on August 5.\n\nWhen asked about the delay, the dministration officials did not address the question directly. They said that US companies had long suffered because of Chinese intellectual-property violations, and that they expected Congress and the business community to support the measure.\n\n\"If Americans continue to have their best technology and intellectual property stolen, or forcibly transferred offshore, the United States will find it difficult to maintain its current technology-leadership position and to remain one of the world's most innovative economies. This is why the President has chosen to act now and to act boldly,\" one administration official said.\n\nMichael Wessel, a commissioner on the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, called the measure \"a critical action, and long overdue\".\n\n\"China's been engaged in the theft and forced transfer of US technologies and intellectual property for years. Those activities haven't abated; they've accelerated as China seeks to become self-sufficient in new technologies and dominate world markets,\" he said.\n\nIf the investigation finds that China is harming US companies, the Trump administration could respond by imposing tariffs, negotiating an agreement with China or other measures, the officials said.\n\nWashington Post", "time": "02:38:00"}

The standoff between North Korea and the US' allies in the region, South Korea and Japan, renders the US more likely to use economic instruments to reign in the regime in Pyongyang, however, sanctions against North Korea alone are inefficient due to the lack of proper market economy mechanisms in North Korea.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ Ahn Young-oonWhy China's Influence on North Korea Amid Escalation With US 'Overestimated'Now, the White House is launching a probe into mainland China's trade practices. Part of the reason is, as President Trump himself has been stating since his election campaign last year, that China has been taking advantage of the US and other major economies economically though the abuse of currency FX rate manipulations and its dirt-cheap workforce. The North Korean crisis, and Beijing's support for Kim Jong-Un, render the US more decisive to change their approach to trade with China.\n\nOn Monday, President Trump is planning to order the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to investigate the possible Chinese violations in trade with the US, which could result in US economic sanctions against Beijing. This would also serve the political purpose of containing the North Korean regime, as China will have fewer resources to give away to Pyongyang.\n\n\"I think they can do a lot more and I think they will do a lot more (to reign in North Korea),\" Trump said. \"We lost hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel. It's not going to continue like that.\"\n\nThe Trump administration intends to look at intellectual property rights and how the Chinese manufacturing sector is using US technology to produce consumer goods for the purpose of selling them in the US market.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ Arun Sankar K.War Games: China Fumes at US, India, Japan Joint Naval ExercisesUS enterprises, including Apple and Google, are either outsourcing or offshoring, or both, the manufacturing of their products, predominantly to mainland China. These electronic products use US technology, but are sold also on the Chinese domestic market and elsewhere, with the lion's share of retail profits going to China.\n\n\"The United States government can, and does, work with countries to address serious concerns such as North Korea while also pursuing measures to address economic concerns, such as the theft of U.S. intellectual property,\" a representative of the US National Security Council said.\n\nThe US agricultural sector exports a significant share of its produce to China, and a major China-bound US export is soybeans. Other US manufacturing giants, including Boeing, are selling aircraft to China, whilst US-made cars also go to the Chinese market.\n\nEven for US-based industrial corporations, the manufacturing production cycle involves parts assembled in China. Besides, the currently low US tariffs on imports allow for an overwhelming presence of Chinese-made goods in the US consumer market, not to mention the Chinese-made steel that goes at near dumping prices to the US market, as Trump himself pointed out.\n\nSubsequently, US sanctions against China, should Trade Representative Lighthizer determine that China has indeed violated certain bilateral trade rules, could address either of these issues or maybe several at once.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ Charles DharapakUS-China Trade War is Unlikely as Both Sides Have Much to Lose - APEC Business CouncilThe first expected move would be an imposition of import tariffs on Chinese-made goods. This would help US inflation and the Federal Reserve's policy tightening, also serving the Trump administration's economic policy agenda. This would also greatly benefit Vietnam and other US trade partners whose manufacturing sectors are export-oriented.\n\nMainland China would, on its part, face a significant drop in its exports to the US and a perspective of losing the competition for the US market to other nations, such as Vietnam, whose products would be in a more favorable position.\n\n\"Protection measures against some specific items, such as steel and aluminum, may gain political favors, but are not likely to be of much help to rebalance trade,\" analysts of the Institute of International Finance said in a research note.\n\nNow, the probe into China's trade was on Trump's agenda more than a week ago, but it was postponed because the US needed to secure China's support in the United Nations (UN) to impose new sanctions against North Korea. Since the new sanctions failed to defuse tensions on the Korea peninsula and the UN yet again demonstrated its lack of utility in case of a major international crisis, Trump is adamant to use all his firepower to achieve his foreign policy goal.\n\nThe US have a history of using the economic instrument before the guns talk, or at least in conjunction with military solutions, including the \"Anaconda\" plan during the War Between States and the oil embargo against Japan imposed in November 1940.\n\n\"We say to China, 'You have a choice whether you do business with North Korea or you do business with the U.S. but you can't do both,'\" Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said.\n\n\u00a9 US Navy/Peter BurghartUS Sailor Overboard Prompts Search and Rescue in South China SeaPossible sanctions against China appear to be a bipartisan effort, and the White House would be able to impose them in a heartbeat, unlike other key reforms Trump is aiming for.\n\nIn June, Senator Van Hollen introduced a bill, co-authored with Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA), which stipulates that \"secondary\" sanctions would be imposed on any third party doing business with North Korean entities.\n\nWhat it means is that the US would be able to freeze bank accounts and freeze the assets of certain companies, not only Chinese ones.\n\nThe economic measures against mainland China would provoke a trade war between China and the US, however, with the global demand for manufactured goods still weak, Beijing would struggle on a nationwide scale, whilst in the US, it would be mainly the consumers that feel the difference. Other manufactured goods producers, including many nations of Southeast Asia, would thus take advantage of China's impaired role in international trade.\n\nIn other markets, including Europe, the Chinese goods would go down in price, thus hampering the European Central Bank's inflation expectations. China would significantly boost its presence in markets other than the US, but this trade rebalancing would take a while.\n\nStill, major trade disruptions, stemming for all these developments, would hamper the global economic growth prospects, and the rising political and economic uncertainty would affect investment and financial markets.", "time": "16:24:00"}

to be the theft of intellectual property, opening a new front of trade friction.\n\nTrump will sign an executive memorandum Monday directing U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider investigating China over its IP policies, especially the practice of forcing U.S. companies operating in China to transfer technological know-how, administration officials said Saturday.\n\nIf China is found to be flouting the rules on U.S. intellectual property, the administration has a range of options, including imposing import tariffs, said the administration officials. If Lighthizer moves forward, the investigation could take as long as a year.\n\nThe intellectual issue complicates the already fraught U.S.-China relationship, which soured further last month when officials from both nations couldn't agree on a joint statement over economic issues after high-level talks in Washington.\n\nStill, Trump's actions stop short of what some analysts had been expecting him to do on intellectual property. Rather than launching straight into a probe, the trade representative will merely consider whether to launch an investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.\n\nSection 301 allows the president to impose tariffs on foreign products in response to unfair or discriminatory restrictions on American commerce. The provision has fallen into disuse since the mid-1990s after the creation of the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe U.S. could file a trade complaint on IP with the WTO or take action outside the WTO process, one administration official said.\n\nIn a report to lawmakers released in July, the trade representative accused China of engaging in \"widespread infringing activity, including trade secret theft, rampant online piracy and counterfeiting, and high levels of physical pirated and counterfeit exports to markets around the globe.\"\n\nEarlier this year, an independent commission on U.S. intellectual property estimated that the annual cost to the U.S. economy in counterfeit goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets from all sources exceeds $225 billion and could be as high as $600 billion. China is the world's principal IP infringer, the commission said.", "time": "02:45:00"}

This month, people familiar with Mr. Trump's deliberations suggested that the administration was prepared to immediately begin an investigation into Chinese theft under the 1974 Trade Act.\n\nChinese officials have repeatedly denied that they have engaged in such practices.

analyst says 'there's no need to have a trade war at all'\n\nPresident Donald Trump may be finding out that taking on China over trade is harder than it looks.\n\nThe White House is stepping up pressure over perceived intellectual-property abuses, and the administration has in recent days proposed fresh duties on imports of China's aluminum foil products. But headway is proving elusive, as deep trade links mean that bold sanctions risk backfiring and targeted ones may end up yielding little. Trump has also backed off past threats citing counterpart Chinese President Xi Jinping's help on North Korea.\n\nA separate bid to use trade probes as a weapon may also turn out to be less effective than using the levers of the World Trade Organization. Landing a blow against China would also be more complicated if the U.S. chooses to target sectors where the countries are connected along global supply chains, which make up a most of their bilateral trade.\n\n\"Trump really doesn't have many cards in his hand,\" said Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. He said the two economies are so closely linked that it's difficult for the U.S. to find a specific industry to assail without triggering repercussions from China.\n\nOn Saturday, administration officials said Trump will direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday to consider investigating China's IP policies, especially the practice of forcing U.S. companies operating in China to transfer technological know-how. If China is found to be flouting rules, the administration's options include imposing import tariffs, officials said. If USTR moves forward, the investigation could take as long as a year.\n\nRead More: Trump Is Said Ready to Turn Up China Heat Over IP Transfers\n\nThe latest move, opening a new front of trade friction even as the countries try to work together to contain North Korea's nuclear threat, is another example of how trade policy isn't as simple as it sounds.\n\nAbout two-thirds of world trade involves value chains that cross borders during production, according to David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and a former U.S. Treasury attache in Beijing. \"A policy that sounds straight-forward -- such as a 45 percent tariff on imports of 'Chinese' products, as then-candidate Donald Trump proposed during his campaign -- would hurt many firms and workers in the U.S., as well as in allies such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan,\" he wrote in a recent report.\n\nOther economists agree. Liu Li-gang, chief China economist at Citigroup Inc. in Hong Kong, said the countries are complementary in many sectors, especially those related to technology. Trade restrictions in such areas, whether higher tariffs or intellectual property probes, would therefore hurt American companies and the country's economy, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, steel and aluminum industries are hardly weak points for China, where most production is sold at home. Steel and aluminum shipments make up only 3.5 percent of total exports, and account for just 0.7 percent of gross domestic product, according to Fielding Chen, an economist at Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong. The Trump administration blames China's excess capacity of the metals for a global glut that's undermining U.S. producers.\n\n\"Despite all the protectionist rhetoric, the Trump administration has done very little to make life harder for Chinese exporters,\" Chen wrote in a recent note. \"Even if it does decide to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, the most widely discussed measures, the impact on China's growth would likely be limited because they make up only a sliver of China's exports and GDP.\"\n\nThe U.S. aluminum foil production industry accounts for $6.8 billion in economic activity annually, according to a statement from the Aluminum Association, a trade group. That works out to less than 0.0004 percent of GDP.\n\nThe U.S. said last week it would seek to impose duties on aluminum foil imports from China, arguing that subsidies for the domestic industry unfairly disadvantage American producers. China can turn to the WTO after Commerce delivers its final ruling on the case in October.\n\nRead More: U.S. Seeks Duties on Chinese Aluminum Foil, Citing Subsidies\n\nChina issued a standard response Thursday, voicing concerns with the probe and urging the U.S. to act prudently and rule fairly to avoid hurting trade ties. The U.S. calculated subsidy levels based on an \"unreasonable\" standard, Commerce Ministry official Wang Hejun said in a statement.\n\nChen Hong, founder of the Suzhou Manakin Aluminum Processing Technology Co., one of five companies singled out in the Commerce Department case, said in an interview that costs will be passed on to the U.S. packaging industry.\n\nUnintended consequences like those show how the U.S. escalating trade tensions with China would have huge underlying costs, according to Citigroup's Liu.\n\nRead More: The U.S. Firms Most at Risk From Trade War With China\n\nA bigger risk for Trump might be that after the rhetoric and potential sanctions, China's economic momentum continues chugging along undisturbed.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario of full trade war, China's exports to the U.S. would drop, but that would shave off just 0.1 percentage point from China's economic growth rate, according to China International Capital Corp.

Radio Sputnik discussed the issue with Hong Kong-based investment and banking specialist Andrew Leung.\n\nAccording to Leung, the main reason behind the US-Chinese dispute is the fact that China wants access to technologies, made by the companies Beijing has invested into.\n\n\"The accusation is that the Chinese state makes it a mandatory requirement to share technology with the invested technology firms from foreign countries. Of course if we share them, that means that intellectual property rights are transferred to Chinese competitors. And indeed that can be held to be a violation of WTO [World Trade Organization] rules,\" Leung said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump may announce a probe into China's alleged intellectual property theft on Monday after repeatedly accusing Beijing of \"unfair\" trade practices, Politico reported.\n\nA government official confirmed to Politico that Trump was going to instruct US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to open the investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 US Trade Act.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ Ahn Young-oonWhy China's Influence on North Korea Amid Escalation With US 'Overestimated'\"I guess there was a time when the relations [between China and the US] were good in the beginning. But then Washington was perceiving that China was not doing their part in pressurizing North Korea,\" the expert noted.\n\nRecently, US President Donald Trump stepped up criticism of China amid Pyongyang's numerous ballistic missile launches. Trump said last month that he was \"very disappointed in China\" over its failure to put pressure on North Korea to halt its nuclear and missile tests.\n\n\"I think that the biggest worry for President Trump is this North Korean thing,\" Leung stated. The current situation shows that it is \"not the time to sour relations\" between the two countries, the expert added.\n\nAt the same time, Leung believes that a trade war between the two countries is unlikely, as it would negatively affect both economies.\n\nAccording to Politico, trade sanctions on China were not expected immediately after the investigation announcement, but could lead to a hike in tariffs on Chinese goods, a move that is likely to breach the World Trade Organization's rules.", "time": "16:24:00"}

accounts for just 0.0004% of GDP Citi analyst says 'there's no need to have a trade war at all'\n\nPresident Donald Trump may be finding out that taking on China over trade is harder than it looks.\n\nThe White House is stepping up pressure over perceived intellectual-property abuses, and the administration has in recent days proposed fresh duties on imports of China's aluminum foil products. But headway is proving elusive, as deep trade links mean that bold sanctions risk backfiring and targeted ones may end up yielding little. Trump has also backed off past threats citing counterpart Chinese President Xi Jinping's help on North Korea.\n\nA separate bid to use trade probes as a weapon may also turn out to be less effective than using the levers of the World Trade Organization. Landing a blow against China would also be more complicated if the U.S. chooses to target sectors where the countries are connected along global supply chains, which make up a most of their bilateral trade.\n\n\"Trump really doesn't have many cards in his hand,\" said Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. He said the two economies are so closely linked that it's difficult for the U.S. to find a specific industry to assail without triggering repercussions from China.\n\nOn Saturday, administration officials said Trump will direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday to consider investigating China's IP policies, especially the practice of forcing U.S. companies operating in China to transfer technological know-how. If China is found to be flouting rules, the administration's options include imposing import tariffs, officials said. If USTR moves forward, the investigation could take as long as a year.\n\nRead More: Trump Is Said Ready to Turn Up China Heat Over IP Transfers\n\nThe latest move, opening a new front of trade friction even as the countries try to work together to contain North Korea's nuclear threat, is another example of how trade policy isn't as simple as it sounds.\n\nAbout two-thirds of world trade involves value chains that cross borders during production, according to David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and a former U.S. Treasury attache in Beijing. \"A policy that sounds straight-forward -- such as a 45 percent tariff on imports of 'Chinese' products, as then-candidate Donald Trump proposed during his campaign -- would hurt many firms and workers in the U.S., as well as in allies such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan,\" he wrote in a recent report.\n\nOther economists agree. Liu Li-gang, chief China economist at Citigroup Inc. in Hong Kong, said the countries are complementary in many sectors, especially those related to technology. Trade restrictions in such areas, whether higher tariffs or intellectual property probes, would therefore hurt American companies and the country's economy, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, steel and aluminum industries are hardly weak points for China, where most production is sold at home. Steel and aluminum shipments make up only 3.5 percent of total exports, and account for just 0.7 percent of gross domestic product, according to Fielding Chen, an economist at Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong. The Trump administration blames China's excess capacity of the metals for a global glut that's undermining U.S. producers.\n\n\"Despite all the protectionist rhetoric, the Trump administration has done very little to make life harder for Chinese exporters,\" Chen wrote in a recent note. \"Even if it does decide to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, the most widely discussed measures, the impact on China's growth would likely be limited because they make up only a sliver of China's exports and GDP.\"\n\nThe U.S. aluminum foil production industry accounts for $6.8 billion in economic activity annually, according to a statement from the Aluminum Association, a trade group. That works out to less than 0.0004 percent of GDP.\n\nThe U.S. said last week it would seek to impose duties on aluminum foil imports from China, arguing that subsidies for the domestic industry unfairly disadvantage American producers. China can turn to the WTO after Commerce delivers its final ruling on the case in October.\n\nRead More: U.S. Seeks Duties on Chinese Aluminum Foil, Citing Subsidies\n\nChina issued a standard response Thursday, voicing concerns with the probe and urging the U.S. to act prudently and rule fairly to avoid hurting trade ties. The U.S. calculated subsidy levels based on an \"unreasonable\" standard, Commerce Ministry official Wang Hejun said in a statement.\n\nChen Hong, founder of the Suzhou Manakin Aluminum Processing Technology Co., one of five companies singled out in the Commerce Department case, said in an interview that costs will be passed on to the U.S. packaging industry.\n\nUnintended consequences like those show how the U.S. escalating trade tensions with China would have huge underlying costs, according to Citigroup's Liu.\n\nRead More: The U.S. Firms Most at Risk From Trade War With China\n\nA bigger risk for Trump might be that after the rhetoric and potential sanctions, China's economic momentum continues chugging along undisturbed.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario of full trade war, China's exports to the U.S. would drop, but that would shave off just 0.1 percentage point from China's economic growth rate, according to China International Capital Corp. The shock would be even smaller should China redirect trading to other nations, CICC analyst Liu Liu in Beijing wrote in a report Wednesday.\n\nInstead of trade war, leaders of the two largest economies should instead solve problems by increasing trade and investment, according to the Institute of International Finance in Washington.\n\nLike China, the U.S. benefits more from bilateral trade ties.

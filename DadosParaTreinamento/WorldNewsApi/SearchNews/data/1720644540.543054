Eastern Cape Floods | Flood-stricken communities lament distasteful conditions at shelters: The relocation of victims of devastating floods in Kariega in the Eastern Cape is currently under way. They are being moved from community halls to students\u2019 accommodations while the government erects temporary structures for them. President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, where he promised the residents that the government would provide them with temporary structures in which they would stay for 30 days. But the residents say this is not good enough. Sherwin Vosloo, one of residents says, \u201cWe moved here from churches to this accommodation, where things have gone from worse to worse because where we are now, the living conditions are not good, it\u2019s inappropriate and uncalled for, and the toilets are not flushing.

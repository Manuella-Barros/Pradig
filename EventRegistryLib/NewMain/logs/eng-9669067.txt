Some offer cash back, while others offer points or miles, and there can be potential benefits and downsides to both options. If you're wondering which type of credit card rewards to choose, it helps to understand how these different card types work.\n\nCash back cards offer cash rewards as a percentage back on your purchases. These cards are often easy to use and primarily feature cash redemptions, though you may be able to choose additional options. Cards that offer points and miles typically have more flexible redemption options, though they're often most valuable when redeemed for travel.\n\nBut the type of rewards credit card and rewards structure that's best for you ultimately depends on your spending habits and lifestyle. We compare cash back versus travel rewards here and outline some of the pros and cons of different types of credit card rewards. This way, you can choose which type of rewards structure is best for your spending habits and lifestyle.\n\nIn general, cash back is the better choice for cardholders hoping to earn uncomplicated rewards on everyday purchases.\n\nCash back credit cards offer a percentage of cash back on each dollar you spend, with some cards offering a higher rate in select categories, like groceries or gas. Some cash back cards offer a flat 1.5 percent to 2 percent cash back for every purchase you make, while others offer higher bonus rewards -- ranging from 3 percent to 5 percent back -- in fixed or rotating categories.\n\nWhile a flat-rate cash back card is great for those who want to take a simple, no-fuss approach to credit card rewards, utilizing fixed or rotating category cards can be a very effective strategy tailored to your spending habits and lifestyle.\n\nA major benefit of cash back cards is their flexibility when it comes to redeeming rewards. Depending on the cash back card you sign up for, you may be able to redeem your rewards for a check in the mail, a direct deposit or a statement credit to your account. Some of the best cash back cards let you cash in your rewards for gift cards, merchandise or travel rewards through your card's travel portal, though the value for these options is often less.\n\nCash back credit cards tend to be a good value for consumers who rarely travel or prefer to save money along the way, rather than build toward a future experience. Cash back rewards are generally worth 1 cent each. For example, a 2 percent cash back card can yield you $2 for every $100 you spend.\n\nConsider these advantages and disadvantages when comparing cash back cards to points and miles credit cards:\n\nA points or miles card may be the better choice for those who travel often or wish to start earning travel rewards. Many types of rewards credit cards fall under the umbrella of \"points and miles\" cards. These cards include airline credit cards that let you earn frequent flyer miles in a specific frequent flyer program, and also flexible rewards cards that let you redeem points for travel in more than one way.\n\nPoints and miles cards also tend to come with useful travel benefits like airport lounge access, travel credits, application fee credits for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck or built-in travel insurance benefits -- although cards with the strongest benefits tend to charge high annual fees.\n\nSome of the best travel credit cards on the market today offer strong flexibility when it comes to redeeming your rewards. If you have a travel credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, for example, you may be able to redeem your points for cash back, gift cards, statement credits, merchandise, travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal or even 1:1 points transfers to Chase airline and hotel partners.\n\nTravel rewards tend to be worth more than cash back, and some of the best travel rewards currencies can be worth up to 2 cents each or more. However, your redemption value depends on how you redeem your travel rewards.\n\nFor example, if you cash in flexible points for a statement credit to your account, you may only get 1 cent per point in value. But if you transfer your points to a high-value travel partner, your points could be boosted to 2 cents each or more. You may also get more than 1 cent per point in value if you redeem your points for travel through your issuer portal.\n\nHere are some general advantages and disadvantages of choosing a points or miles card over a cash back card:\n\nWhen it comes to cash back versus points, it comes down to your spending habits and lifestyle. If you don't travel much or care about using your rewards strategically toward lofty travel goals, you're best suited for cash rewards.\n\nYou may want to opt for a flat-rate cash back card so you don't need to keep up with rotating bonus categories or activating your rewards. No matter which type of cash back card you choose, this move will benefit you due to the sheer simplicity of earning rewards. And you'll still get something back from your credit card spending, even if you don't get the most value for your rewards.\n\nIf you get a rush out of turning $500 worth of credit card rewards into $750 or $1,000 worth of travel, then you're a perfect candidate for a card that offers rewards in the form of points or miles. You'd benefit from a travel card that gives you plenty of options for boosted points or miles values and travel upgrades. If you travel throughout the year and want access to benefits to make air travel more comfortable, then an elite travel card may be an even better fit.\n\nTo determine whether a cash back, points or miles card is better for you, you'll need to know what kind of cardholder you are and what type of rewards structure most closely matches your spending habits and lifestyle.\n\nBut it doesn't necessarily come down to choosing between cash back vs. rewards. It's not uncommon for cardholders to pair a few different credit cards to maximize their rewards, so trying out different credit card combinations and rewards structures could also be an option.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "holly_d_johnson@bankrate.com", "name": "Holly D.

Having a card exclusively for business purchases also allows you to keep personal spending separate, which can mean fewer headaches at tax time.\n\nMost business credit cards allow you to earn rewards in the form of points, miles or cash back. Additionally, business credit cards can include other features and benefits, such as free employee cards, travel perks and access to discounts on business services.\n\nWith so many business credit cards to choose from, finding the right one while keeping all of this information in mind might seem a little overwhelming. That's why we'll break down the five most important steps to take when it comes to choosing the best business credit card for your business needs.\n\nLike personal credit cards, business credit cards can be broken up into various categories. Some popular ones include:\n\nWhile shopping around, it'll be beneficial to focus on credit cards that will cater to your business needs in particular.\n\nFinding the right rewards programs goes hand in hand with finding out what type of business credit card you should get, which is why it's important to choose a card that reflects your spending habits. Earning rewards on a business credit card can save you money when you apply those rewards as a statement credit against purchases or redeem them for travel or cash.\n\nWhen it comes to how you can earn rewards, every business credit card is different. For example, your business budget might include spending on:\n\nIt's important to match your card's rewards program with your business's \"lifestyle.\" For example, if your business primarily spends on everyday operations, you might prefer a card that pays you cash back on office supplies, utilities and advertising. On the other hand, a travel card could make more sense if you book frequent business trips.\n\nCertain cards also offer boosted rewards, with some spending categories earning more points, miles or cash back than others. There may be spending caps that limit the dollar amount of rewards you can earn each year.\n\nOther business credit cards offer a flat rewards rate on all purchases, which can be useful for those who have varied spending. With The American Express Blue Business Cash Card, for example, you earn 2 percent cash back on all purchases up to $50,000 per year, then it drops to 1 percent. Maxing out that spending limit can net you an extra $1,000 a year without even having to think about rewards categories.\n\nEstimating the amount you could earn based on your typical monthly spending can help you decide which one might work best.\n\nAlso, don't forget about introductory rewards or anniversary bonuses. Many business credit cards offer a sign-up bonus when you meet a minimum spending requirement. Some may also reward you with anniversary rewards each year. Those are both additional opportunities to increase your rewards earnings if your primary goal for getting a business credit card is racking up points, miles or cash back.\n\nWhile some business credit cards don't charge an annual fee, they might not have the same level of perks as those that do. As a general rule, the better the rewards program, features and benefits the card comes with, the higher the fee tends to be.\n\nWhether it makes sense for you to pay an annual fee depends on your spending and what you're hoping to get from the card.\n\nFor example, say you're eyeing The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express for travel. To recoup the card's $695 annual fee in Membership Rewards points alone, you'd need to spend $14,000 a year on flights and prepaid hotels booked through AmexTravel.com. But American Express also offers Biz Platinum cardholders high-value perks like statement credits for:\n\nCardholders also get airport lounge access and a slew of travel protections -- all of which can offset the card's annual fee.\n\nOn the other hand, you might choose something like Capital One Spark Miles for Business instead if you'd like to keep things simple. This card earns an unlimited 2X miles on all eligible purchases, with no category restrictions. There's a $0 introductory annual fee the first year, then $95 each year thereafter. The only trade-off is that this card offers less in the way of travel benefits compared to a luxury travel card like the Amex Business Platinum Card -- no airport lounge access, for example.\n\nPaying interest with any credit card makes your purchases more expensive. The best way to avoid interest is to pay in full every month. If you think you'll need to carry a balance from time to time, however, it's important to understand what purchase APR you'll pay.\n\nYou might be interested in choosing a card with a low or 0 percent introductory APR if you're planning a large purchase for the business. For example, the Ink Business Unlimited\u00ae Credit Card offers a 0 percent introductory APR on purchases for 12 months (then 18.49 percent to 24.49 percent variable APPR), so you'd have a full year to pay off your purchase with this card before interest begins accruing. Low APR balance transfers are less common with business credit cards, though there are a few that offer them.\n\nIn general, the better your credit score, the lower the interest rate and APR you're likely to qualify for. Business credit card issuers can base approval on your personal credit scores if you don't have much business credit history, so you might want to check your credit history before applying to get an idea of what rate you might be able to get.\n\nAlso, be aware that there's a difference between business credit cards and business charge cards. With a credit card, you can make purchases and pay them down over time, usually accruing interest charges each month. A business charge card, such as the popular Brex Card*, doesn't charge interest since you're required to pay the balance in full each month. If you'd like the flexibility of carrying a balance, then you may want to rule out charge cards in your search for a business credit card.\n\nBusiness credit cards can offer more than just rewards. For example, some of the valuable features and benefits you might be able to take advantage of include:\n\nBut remember, the more perks a business card has, the more you'll likely pay for the annual fee.\n\nGetting a business credit card could make your life as an entrepreneur easier if you can charge purchases as needed while earning some of what you spend back. When considering the best business credit cards, take time to weigh the rewards and benefits of each, as well as the fees and APR. Ultimately, the best business credit card for you is the one that offers rewards and features that fit your spending style at a cost you're comfortable paying.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_lounge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport lounge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charge card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Trading Cards", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading Cards", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.bankrate.com/2023/05/05175428/Cards-How-To-Choose-A-Business-Credit-Card.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669067", "eventUri": "eng-9669067", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

It earns 1.5 percent back on all purchases and charges no annual fee, which makes it a good choice for more than one type of cardholder.\n\nIs the Capital One Quicksilver the right option for you? Read on to learn who can benefit from this card and whether you should consider applying.\n\nFor the simple product that this cash back card is, Capital One Quicksilver can fit various types of cardholders with different goals. Here are four scenarios in which the Quicksilver may be an excellent addition to your wallet:\n\nSome people like to have multiple cards and an intricate credit card strategy, while others don't want to complicate things. It's understandable: Figuring out how to earn the most rewards every time you pull out your wallet and then calculating the best way to use them can be overwhelming.\n\nIf that sounds like a struggle to you, the Capital One Quicksilver can be a good product. It's a true no-fuss credit card. You get the same cash back rate, no matter what you buy, and you don't have to worry about annual fees, rotating categories or choosing the right card for every purchase. In fact, the only time the rewards earning differs is when you earn more than 1.5 percent -- that's when the 5 percent back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel comes into play.\n\nRedeeming rewards is simple, too. You don't have to chase down the transfer partner with the highest point value or scour the internet for good travel deals -- just use cash back as a statement credit to offset any purchase you wish.\n\nIf you do have multiple credit cards and your goal is to maximize rewards in every possible way, a flat-rate cash back credit card is a must-have in your arsenal.\n\nRewards credit cards, whether it's a bonus cash back credit card or travel card, typically offer high rewards rates only in certain categories, while the rest of your purchases earn 1 percent cash back or 1 point per dollar. To ensure you earn more than that whatever you spend on, you'll need a card like Capital One Quicksilver.\n\nThe simple rewards system and lack of annual fees aren't the only two great things about Quicksilver. It also comes with a lengthy zero-interest intro period.\n\nWhen you get the card, you have 15 months of 0 percent intro APR on purchases, meaning you pay no interest if you carry a balance during your first 15 months with the card. (Note, you still have to make minimum payments and a 19.99 percent to 29.99 percent variable APR applies after that).\n\nThis can come in handy if you're looking to fund a large purchase. You'll get enough time to pay it off and still earn cash back without any interest eating into your rewards.\n\nIf you haven't had a rewards credit card before, the Capital One Quicksilver card can be a great starter cash back card. It can get you into the habit of paying with your credit card as much as you can to earn rewards and paying off your credit card bill in full every month so you don't lose your cash back to interest.\n\nOnce you're comfortable with your Quicksilver, you can decide if you want to take on more credit cards and have a more complex card strategy or if one flat-rate cash back card is sufficient for you.\n\nIn fact, the Capital One Quicksilver was my first rewards credit card. It helped me build credit and get into the world of rewards. It's such a good stepping-stone kind of card. Since then, I've learned to juggle multiple cards and rewards currencies, including cash back, points and miles. It can be a lot, so I'm glad I didn't dive in before getting my feet wet first.\n\nWhile the Capital One Quicksilver can be a solid choice, no card is perfect for everyone. In certain situations, you might want to look into other options.\n\nJuggling multiple credit cards isn't for everyone, and that's ok. In this case, you want to ensure your single credit card has a lot to offer -- or more than the competition, at the very least.\n\nWhen it comes to flat-rate cash back, you can find cards that will earn you more. For example, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card gets you unlimited 2 percent cash rewards on purchases. Let's say you spend $10,000 on your card per year. With the Wells Fargo Active Cash you'd earn $200 in cash rewards annually, compared to $150 with the Quicksilver. The more you spend, the bigger that difference will be.\n\nIn terms of benefits, the Capital One Quicksilver is somewhat bare-bones. Right now, you can get six months of complimentary Uber One membership statement credits. However, that's not a permanent perk and is set to expire on Nov. 14, 2024. Besides that, the card offers minimal benefits you're likely to find on most other cards.\n\nThe Capital One Quicksilver is a good card with a simple rewards system and no annual fee. There are plenty of instances it could be a great addition to your wallet -- but it isn't the only flat-rate cash back credit card worth considering.\n\nIf you're in the market for a no-annual-fee card that earns rewards on every purchase, here are a few other options we recommend looking into.\n\nIf you're choosing your first cash back card but planning on getting a premium rewards credit card in the future, you may want to get the American Express Cash Magnet Card. It earns 1.5 percent cash back on all purchases, charges no annual fees and can help you create a relationship with American Express. Credit card issuers tend to reward loyalty, and Amex offers some of the most desirable rewards card products.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Unlimited is another 1.5 percent cash back credit card which also earns 5 percent cash back on travel purchased through the Chase Travel portal and 3 percent cash back on dining and drugstore purchases. This rewards structure allows for more cash back potential than the Capital One Quicksilver can offer. Plus, the rewards are officially Chase Ultimate Rewards points, a popular travel rewards currency, so it can be an excellent card to get if you're interested in joining or already earning Chase Ultimate Rewards.\n\nFinally, the Citi Double Cash Card is another option that can offer more value than the Quicksilver. With this card, you'll earn unlimited 1 percent cash back on all purchases and another 1 percent when you pay them off.

That's why it feels like such a win when you get cash back for using a credit card to make purchases you were going to make anyway, such as buying gas or dining out.\n\nCash back credit cards typically offer cash rewards at a flat rate or as a bonus (or rotating) rewards structure. To get cash back from a credit card, all you have to do is spend money on an eligible purchase. Whenever you make an eligible purchase with your card, you'll automatically earn a percentage back based on the rules of your card.\n\nBut a credit card also unlocks the ability to access cash from an ATM. This type of cash advance is like a loan against your credit limit, and it comes with hefty fees and high interest from the moment you complete your transaction.\n\nBefore you start swiping, here's how to understand the difference between cash back and a cash advance, as well as how earning and redeeming cash back works with rewards cards, to get the most bang for your buck.\n\nWhen we talk about how to get cash back by using a credit card, it's important to understand that there's a difference between getting cash back rewards and getting cash as a cash advance. While cash back rewards are small returns on the money you've already spent with your credit card, a cash advance is essentially a loan against the credit limit on your credit card.\n\nFor example, you can take out a cash advance on your credit card by using your credit card to get cash out of an ATM. In that case, you're charged a cash advance fee. You'll also be subject to a high interest rate that begins to accrue immediately from the day of withdrawal. In short, a cash advance will likely cost you a lot of money and is rarely a good option.\n\nYou can request a cash advance with your credit card from most ATMs. Simply insert your credit card into the ATM as you would any other card. Enter your PIN, and you should see an option for a cash withdrawal or cash advance.\n\nEnter the amount of cash you'd like to withdraw and review and accept any acknowledgement of cash advance fees you're likely to see. After you fully complete the transaction, you can collect your cash.\n\nFlat-rate credit cards offer consumers a hassle-free approach to cash back. With a flat-rate cash back credit card, every purchase earns the same rate of cash back. The best flat-rate cards give cardholders 1.5 percent to 2 percent cash back on every purchase.\n\nThe Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card provides up to 2 percent cash back on every purchase -- 1 percent when you make purchases and another 1 percent when you pay off your purchases. That means for every $100 you spend on your card, you earn $2 back.\n\nFlat-rate credit cards usually appeal to people who prefer flexible rewards and don't want to juggle different types of credit cards for different spending categories. They're also useful for purchases that aren't typically covered by bonus or rotating category cards. For instance, consider the many recurring expenses you have every month, such as utility and internet bills. These categories aren't typically covered by bonus rewards categories, so a flat-rate credit card could come in handy if you're looking to get cash back on expenses you know you're going to have every month.\n\nIf you choose a credit card with a bonus or rotating cash back structure, you'll earn more rewards for purchases within common bonus or rotating categories that include groceries, dining, gas or travel. Consider the biggest spending categories in your budget when choosing a bonus or rotating category cash back card.\n\nFor cash back credit cards with set bonus categories, categories generally remain the same over time. For cards with rotating bonus categories, categories can change quarterly. Some bonus cash back cards also offer the flexibility of choosing your own bonus categories or automatically offer bonus cash back on your biggest eligible spending category each month. And then there are cards that offer both fixed and rotating bonus categories.\n\nFor example, the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120* offers rotating cash back categories and tiered cash back categories. You'll earn 5 percent cash back on activated, rotating categories each quarter (on up to $1,500 in purchases per quarter, then 1 percent back); 5 percent back on Chase Travel purchases; 5 percent back on Lyft rides (through March 2025); 3 percent back on dining at restaurants and drugstore purchases; and 1 percent cash back on all other purchases.\n\nOn the other hand, the Citi Custom Cash\u00ae Card offers 5 percent cash back on your top eligible spending category each billing cycle (up to $500 each billing cycle, then 1 percent).\n\nTypically, rotating categories (and some bonus categories) are capped at a specific spending maximum, after which your cash back rate drops to 1 percent. And some cards require quarterly activations in order to earn a boosted rate on new bonus categories. If you don't activate a bonus category, you won't get the boosted rate.\n\nMost cash back credit cards also offer lucrative cash back sign-up bonuses, also called welcome bonuses, to new cardholders -- something worth paying attention to when choosing a card. To receive a welcome bonus, you'll typically have to meet a spending requirement within a specific timeframe. Before you sign up for a card, consider how much you'll need to spend each month in order to hit that threshold. If a card requires spending more than you're used to, the sign-up bonus may not be worth it.\n\nStill, you can't beat money as a welcome gift, and you can often earn a sizable sign-up bonus without spending a lot of money. For example, the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card offers new cardholders a $200 cash bonus after spending $500 in the first three months of card membership.\n\nThe actual process of redeeming your rewards depends on the rules of the individual cash back card you hold. Your cards may require you to accrue a minimum amount of cash back rewards before you can redeem them.\n\nUsually, the most common ways to redeem cash back rewards are by requesting a statement credit to offset your current card balance or by having the funds deposited into a linked bank account. You may also be able to request your rewards in the form of a check. Otherwise, many issuers also allow you to redeem cash back for gift cards, merchandise or shopping with select retailers.\n\nSome cash back cards actually earn points instead of cash back. In that case, cardholders can often redeem their rewards for travel through their issuer's travel portal. This can often be one of the most lucrative ways to redeem cash back, as many issuers offer at least 1 cent per point when you redeem this way.\n\nCredit cards are a convenient way to access cash and cash back rewards. Getting cash from an ATM with your credit card is easy, but you'll want to weigh that ease with the hefty fees and high APRs that apply from the minute you withdraw that cash.\n\nRedeeming earned rewards as cash depends on the type of card you've earned those rewards with. Flat-rate cards earn the same rewards across all purchases, while rotating rewards cards offer higher rewards on specific categories that can include gas, groceries and travel. You can then redeem those rewards for a range of options that include statement credits, gift cards and bonus checks.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacqueline_demarco@bankrate.com", "name": "Jacqueline DeMarco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automated teller machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Credit limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flat rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Trading Cards", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading Cards", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.bankrate.com/2021/06/28161833/Untitled-114.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669067", "eventUri": "eng-9669067", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Choose poorly and you could miss out on some of the most effortless credit card rewards out there. Choose well and you could put substantial cash back in your pocket.\n\nCash back credit cards reward you based on a percentage of every eligible purchase you make. Instead of calculating the cash value of points or miles rewards, you earn a straightforward amount that you can redeem as a statement credit, direct deposit or a check. Before applying for a cash back credit card, walk through the process to choose the best one for your needs.\n\nTo understand whether a cash back card is even the right choice for you, let's take a look at some of the pros and cons:\n\nNow that you have the basics, let's consider the factors to think about as your research and ultimately choose your card.\n\nCash back cards typically come in one of four types of cash back programs:\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all cash back card winner, as the credit card that can deliver the most cash back for you will depend on your everyday spending habits. While flat-rate cards can be a good choice for those who prefer a hands-off approach to earning cash back, you may be able to boost your overall return with a card that provides a higher cash back rate in certain fixed or rotating bonus categories.\n\nWhen you know you're earning the same rate of rewards for everything, using your cash back credit card becomes a no-brainer. Flat-rate cash back cards earn a fixed percentage -- usually between 1 and 2 percent cash back -- on all purchases. Making it one of the simplest rewards structures to understand.\n\nWhether you're booking travel or buying groceries you'll earn the same rate of cash back on your purchases each time you swipe. These types of cash back cards are ideal for those who just started exploring credit card rewards or aren't fans of keeping up with categories.\n\nPlus, a card with a higher flat cash back rate can be lucrative if you qualify.\n\nIf you're looking for a flat rate card, you might be wondering, \"What is a good cash back rate on a credit card?\" At a minimum, you should be looking for a card offering at least 1.5 percent cash back on all purchases. Some of the best flat-rate cash back cards offer a rewards rate of 2 percent -- although there are times when a 1.5 percent card might better fit your spending.\n\nA fixed bonus category card, or tiered rate card, offers a higher cash back rate in specific categories -- anywhere from 2 percent to 6 percent -- and at least 1 percent cash back on all other purchases. Common fixed bonus categories include dining, groceries and gas station purchases.\n\nNote, however, that bonus categories are often capped at a certain level of spending. These spending levels are typically enforced either quarterly or annually. After you've met the maximum spending limit, the base cash back rate applies to any additional spending in that category.\n\nFixed category cards are great for people who are highly aware of their spending and swipe the most within the higher bonus categories.\n\nRotating bonus category cards offer higher cash back percentages (often 5 percent) in purchase categories that typically change every month or quarter. Some common bonus categories include home improvement stores, streaming services, drugstores, select retailers and wholesale clubs.\n\nMany cards require you to activate bonus categories to get the higher cash back rate, so it's a good idea to schedule calendar reminders so that you don't miss out. Card issuers also often impose quarterly spending caps on this type of cash back, after which the base cash back rate (usually 1 percent) will apply for that category.\n\nWith fixed bonus categories and rotating bonus categories, you're at the mercy of your card issuer when it comes to which purchases you earn a bonus rate on. But there's a lesser-known option that puts you in the driver's seat -- cardholder's choice cards.\n\nThese types of cash back credit cards work similarly to rotating category cards and let you pick which category you'll earn a bonus rate on each month. You may need to set a reminder to choose your bonus category, but it might be worth it. You know what you spend your money on better than anyone else, and you know which purchases you have planned for the month ahead. So if you prefer a little more control over how you earn cash back, this might be the one for you.\n\nIf several of the types appeal to you, you could consider carrying more than one. Managing multiple credit cards isn't for everyone, but if you are responsible and organized, having a couple of cash back cards in your wallet offers a nice path to maximizing rewards on all your spending.\n\nAssembling a toolbelt of credit cards can be part of an effective strategy to maximize your rewards. A common way to approach this is to pair one or more bonus category cards with a high-earning, flat-rate card. The bonus category card rewards your most frequent purchases while the flat rate card earns consistent cash back on everything else. As long as you can keep track of when to use each card, you'll be in a position to maximize your cash back earnings.\n\nSome cash back cards could even act as part of a travel rewards strategy. For example, using the Chase Freedom FlexSM* or Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae awards your \"cash back\" in the form of Chase Ultimate Rewards points. Then you can redeem those points for cash back or combine them with points earned on other Chase credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. If you then redeem your rewards for travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards program, or transfer them to a travel partner, they could be worth more than a cash redemption.\n\nIt's not hard to find a robust cash back credit card with no annual fee. However, some cash back cards with a higher rewards rate may charge an annual fee. Even with the added cost, you might enjoy the valuable perks and benefits that the card offers. Before you write off the cash back credit cards with an annual fee, run the numbers and see if the benefits quite literally outweigh the cost.\n\nHowever, the cost of an annual fee can often be recouped by the cash back you'll earn, annual credits or other card benefits. If the card you're eyeing has an annual fee, take a look at the card's rewards structure and benefits to determine if the fee will be worth it for you.\n\nThe next factors you should consider when choosing a cash back credit card are the sign up bonuses and APR promotions. If you were already going to get the credit card and spend money with it, then why not get the added bonus of a 0 interest period or extra cash back?\n\nThe most competitive cash back credit cards offer lucrative welcome bonuses ranging into the hundreds of dollars for meeting a defined spending target within the first few months of account opening. Others may have a welcome offer that grants you 0 percent APR for a limited time, which is perfect for planning out a large purchase. And in some cases you may have both offers available.\n\nWelcome offers also make it easier to narrow down your choices as you compare cards. You may still want to take the standard interest rate into consideration for when your intro APR period ends in case you have to carry a balance. The current average credit card interest rate is more than 20 percent, which will add up quickly if you cannot make more than the minimum payment for any reason. However, paying off your credit card each month can help you avoid paying interest and take full advantage of your rewards.\n\nThe extra benefits and perks hiding in the card terms can make your cash back credit card more valuable when you put them to good use. When you're choosing a cash back credit card, don't base your decision solely on the rewards rate -- look for these benefits as well:\n\nNot all cash back cards will offer these benefits, and you may not be interested in many of these benefits anyway. Ultimately, you should consider whether you'd actually take advantage of any of these perks and whether they'd be worth it for you.\n\nCash back credit cards usually allow cardholders to redeem cash back in the form of a direct deposit, check or statement credit to offset your balance. In addition to that, some cards may allow you to redeem cash back for gift cards, charitable donations, purchases with select merchants, as points toward travel purchases and more.\n\nRemember, credit card rewards are only worth something when you redeem them. A 2023 CreditCards.com Credit Card Rewards Survey found that 23 percent of cardholders hadn't redeemed their rewards in the past year. When evaluating a cash back credit card, focus on how usable a card will be for you. Keep an eye out for issues like minimum cash back redemption requirements, cash back expiration policies and any other restrictions on how you can redeem cash back.\n\nThere's no shortage of cash back credit cards with amazing benefits, valuable perks and high cash back rates. So when it comes to choosing the right one for lifestyle, narrow it down and compare. There are few methods you can use to decide between cash back card options:\n\nIf you've narrowed it down to two cash back cards and aren't sure which one to go with, you might find it useful to read in-depth card reviews comparing the two options. Here are a few top head-to-head cash back card comparisons:\n\nWhether you use some of these tools and tips or all of them, it can be helpful to compare multiple credit card offers in one place. This allows you to clearly determine where the bar is and see which offers and benefits stick out from the crowd.\n\nYou're already making everyday purchases that could add up to thousands of dollars each year, so why not earn some cash back on it? When you know what a good rate is on a cash back credit card and how to make it work with your spending habits, you can use those rewards to your advantage. As long as you're paying your bill in full every month, you'll avoid the interest charges that could cut into your cash back. To take the next step in maximizing your cash back rewards, consider including a flat rate card and a category card to cover all your spending bases.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flat rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chase Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy_(shop)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy (shop)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wholesaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_improvement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home improvement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gift card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Trading Cards", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading Cards", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.bankrate.com/2024/01/18105748/How-To-Choose-A-Cash-Back-Credit-Card-_-Bankrate.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669067", "eventUri": "eng-9669067", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

After misestimating key revenue generators, the bank is renegotiating the agreement with Bilt Technologies.\n\nLaunched in 2022, Well Fargo's co-branded credit card came with an attractive feature. Cardholders can use it to pay rent without having to pay landlord fees while also earning rewards points that can be spent on travel, goods and so forth.\n\nWells Fargo apparently expected that the card would appeal to young individuals who would use it for shopping, rent payments and debt carrying, giving the bank the opportunity to generate profit from interchange fees and interest charges.\n\nIt turned out that cardholders were wiser with their purchases than anticipated. It has been reported that several consumers charged their rent to their credit cards and then paid it off within a few days, earning them rewards points. It is claimed that just 15% to 25% of the total amount charged to the card was carried over from month to month.\n\nIn addition, very few clients used the card for discretionary purchases. Wells Fargo made a significant error in estimating that 65% of purchases made with the card would be non-rental.\n\nPer the WSJ report, the card also reportedly posed fraud and money laundering threats, which Wells Fargo and Bilt are working to address. Considering these factors, WFC informed Bilt that unless the card starts to yield positive results, it will not be extending its agreement, which ends in 2029.\n\nBilt CEO Ankur Jain stated, \"We are only 18 months into the cobrand partnership with lots of opportunity to drive even more everyday spend behavior.\" \"And are committed to making this a win-win together.\"\n\nAt present, WFC has eight different types of credit cards available. These cards provide a unique set of benefits to its target audience. The bank is actively introducing attractive products to transform its business credit card offerings.\n\nLast month, the company launched Signify Business Cash World Elite Mastercard -- its new business credit card with industry-leading cash rewards. Signify Business Cash cardholders will have access to the Wells Fargo Business Rewards Program, which provides flexible redemption options. Cardholders can redeem cash rewards as a statement credit to their Signify Business Cash account, as a direct deposit into an eligible Wells Fargo savings or checking account, or for gift cards, travel and more.\n\nIdentifying the right customers and strategically introducing new credit card products are set to position Wells Fargo for long-term success in the card business.\n\nIn the past six months, shares of WFC have jumped 21% compared with the industry's 16.1% growth.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, Wells Fargo sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

After misestimating key revenue generators, the bank is renegotiating the agreement with Bilt Technologies.\n\nLaunched in 2022, Well Fargo's co-branded credit card came with an attractive feature. Cardholders can use it to pay rent without having to pay landlord fees while also earning rewards points that can be spent on travel, goods and so forth.\n\nWells Fargo apparently expected that the card would appeal to young individuals who would use it for shopping, rent payments and debt carrying, giving the bank the opportunity to generate profit from interchange fees and interest charges.\n\nIt turned out that cardholders were wiser with their purchases than anticipated. It has been reported that several consumers charged their rent to their credit cards and then paid it off within a few days, earning them rewards points. It is claimed that just 15% to 25% of the total amount charged to the card was carried over from month to month.\n\nIn addition, very few clients used the card for discretionary purchases. Wells Fargo made a significant error in estimating that 65% of purchases made with the card would be non-rental.\n\nPer the WSJ report, the card also reportedly posed fraud and money laundering threats, which Wells Fargo and Bilt are working to address. Considering these factors, WFC informed Bilt that unless the card starts to yield positive results, it will not be extending its agreement, which ends in 2029.\n\nBilt CEO Ankur Jain stated, \"We are only 18 months into the cobrand partnership with lots of opportunity to drive even more everyday spend behavior.\" \"And are committed to making this a win-win together.\"\n\nAt present, WFC has eight different types of credit cards available. These cards provide a unique set of benefits to its target audience. The bank is actively introducing attractive products to transform its business credit card offerings.\n\nLast month, the company launched Signify Business Cash World Elite Mastercard -- its new business credit card with industry-leading cash rewards. Signify Business Cash cardholders will have access to the Wells Fargo Business Rewards Program, which provides flexible redemption options. Cardholders can redeem cash rewards as a statement credit to their Signify Business Cash account, as a direct deposit into an eligible Wells Fargo savings or checking account, or for gift cards, travel and more.\n\nIdentifying the right customers and strategically introducing new credit card products are set to position Wells Fargo for long-term success in the card business.\n\nCurrently, Wells Fargo sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOther finance firms are progressing well with the credit card business. In May 2024, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC launched the PNC CashUnlimited Visa Signature credit card. The credit card offers simple but valuable rewards with an unlimited 2% cash back on all eligible purchases.\n\nIn March 2024, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD unveiled its first-ever credit card in an effort to expand its services beyond mainstream trading. The credit card, known as the Robinhood Gold Card, will be available exclusively to Robinhood Gold customers.\n\nFree Report - 3 Stocks Sneaking Into Hydrogen Energy\n\nDemand for clean hydrogen energy is projected to reach $500 billion by 2030 and grow 5-FOLD by 2050.

It features an impressive 2 percent cash rewards structure, an easy-to-earn welcome bonus and introductory APR offers on both purchases and qualifying balance transfers.\n\nKeep reading for a more in-depth look at the card's details and list of benefits.\n\nAs a welcome bonus, new cardholders can earn a $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 on purchases within the first three months of account opening. This is an attractive offer that's in line with the welcome bonuses that other no-annual-fee cash rewards cards offer. For example, the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120* also offers a $200 cash bonus after spending $500 within the first three months.\n\nThis card offers unlimited 2 percent cash rewards on all purchases, making it among the best flat-rate and best 2 percent cash rewards cards available. In general, a flat-rate rewards structure is an ideal choice for those who don't plan on shopping heavily within specific bonus categories or prefer the simplicity of earning the same rewards rate on all purchases.\n\nIn terms of redemption options, you can redeem your rewards for:\n\nAs a new Active Cash cardholder, you'll receive a 0 percent intro APR on purchases for 15 months from account opening, followed by a variable APR of 20.24 percent, 25.24 percent or 29.99 percent. This can be a helpful feature if you need to pay off a large purchase over time, free of interest.\n\nYou'll also receive a 0 percent intro APR on qualifying balance transfers for 15 months from account opening, followed by a variable APR of 20.24 percent, 25.24 percent or 29.99 percent. Balance transfers must be made within 120 days of account opening to qualify for the intro APR offer. Also, note that the Wells Fargo Active Cash charges an introductory 3 percent balance transfer fee ($5 minimum) for the first 120 days from account opening. After the first 120 days, the balance transfer fee increases to 5 percent ($5 minimum).\n\nThis intro APR offer is pretty standard compared to other balance transfer offers on the market. If you're mainly interested in the Active Cash due to this perk, though, be certain that you can afford to pay off your debt within the 15-month window. If not, there are other top balance transfer credit cards that offer a 0 percent intro APR for up to 21 months, though these cards likely won't offer the same tier of ongoing cash rewards.\n\nThe Active Cash also comes with cellphone protection of up to $600 per claim when you pay your cellphone bill with your credit card (up to two claims per year; subject to a $25 deductible). This insurance will cover you against damage or theft. If you're planning to pay for cellphone insurance separately, this benefit could be an easy way to save money.\n\nAs a Visa Signature credit card, Active Cash cardholders get access to Visa Signature benefits, including complimentary, 24/7 access to the Visa Signature\u00ae Concierge. This can be a useful perk if you need assistance with planning travel, dining or entertainment.\n\nYou'll also get access to the Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection, which features over 900 luxury hotels around the world. You'll get premium benefits like automatic room upgrades (when available), complimentary in-room Wi-Fi (when available), complimentary breakfast for two, a $25 food or beverage credit and late checkout upon request (when available).\n\nMaximizing the Wells Fargo Active Cash starts with earning the welcome bonus, which is a $200 cash rewards bonus after you spend $500 within the first three months. Thankfully, it's a straightforward process. Make sure to spend at least $167 each month for three months with your Active Cash card, and you'll automatically earn your $200 cash rewards bonus.\n\nIn terms of ongoing rewards, if you hold one or more rewards credit cards with specified bonus categories, use the Active Cash to cover everything your bonus category cards don't cover. For example, if you have another card that offers a higher rewards rate on groceries, dining and travel, use that card to cover those types of purchases. Then, use the Active Cash for everything else -- such as bills, gas purchases, department store shopping, and so on -- in order to earn 2 percent cash rewards on \"non-category\" spending.\n\nIf you plan to take advantage of the Active Cash card's balance transfer offer, you'll want to make sure you transfer your balance within the first 120 days of opening your account. There's an introductory 3 percent balance transfer fee ($5 minimum) for the first 120 days from account opening, after which the fee increases to 5 percent ($5 minimum). Plus, the sooner you transfer your balance, the sooner you'll be able to start paying off your debt, interest-free.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of Wells Fargo's cellphone protection benefit, you'll need to make sure you begin paying your monthly cellphone phone bill with the Active Cash. Otherwise, you won't be able to take advantage of this benefit.\n\nIf you're looking for a credit card that offers a high cash rewards rate on purchases -- with no rotating bonus categories to activate and track -- the Wells Fargo Active Cash may be a good fit for you. This card can also be worth it if you're planning to make a balance transfer (or pay off a large, upcoming purchase). On top of that, the welcome bonus, Visa Signature perks and cellphone protection certainly sweeten the pot.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Visa Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employee benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Department store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Trading Cards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading Cards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.bankrate.com/2022/04/18150631/Wells-Fargo-Active-Cash-Card-benefits-guide.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669067", "eventUri": "eng-9669067", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.7725490196078431, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

That way, I could earn free travel faster through combined spending. Unlike some other issuers, Capital One lets you turn your cash back into miles, which I find to be a huge advantage.\n\nUnfortunately, the experience wasn't as intuitive as I hoped.\n\nThe conversion process itself is simple and quick. However, getting to it can be a bit of a quest. It definitely was for me, and I write about cards for a living. It took calling Capital One and searching Reddit to figure out the steps to take. Here's how to move your Capital One rewards, which cards are eligible and why to do it in the first place.\n\nYou can only transfer cash back to another Capital One cash back card or travel card. The issuer doesn't allow converting miles into cash back.\n\nTo do a transfer, log in to your Capital One account through your browser. Note that you can't complete a transfer through the app. Once you're logged in, you'll see tiles of all your Capital One accounts, as well as rewards. Click \"View Rewards.\"\n\nNext, choose the account you want to move the rewards from:\n\nNow, scroll down until you see \"Move rewards\" -- which is what you want to do.\n\nWhen you click the tile, pick the account you want to send the rewards to.\n\nNext, you'll be prompted to input how much cash back you want to move. The transfer ratio is 1 cent per mile, meaning you get 100 miles for each dollar transferred.\n\nAfter indicating how much you want to transfer, click the \"Share\" button. The rewards will move to the designated account immediately.\n\nTo convert cash back into miles with Capital One, you'll need a miles-earning card, such as:\n\nAs for the cash back cards, you have many options, including:\n\nSuch extensive lists provide plenty of opportunities to create a valuable card pairing. For example, if you have one of the Capital One Savor cards and one of the Venture cards, you can earn generous cash back on food and entertainment and turn it into miles to book travel with. Or, if you have the VentureOne and the Quicksilver, you can earn 1.5 percent on all purchases with the Quicksilver and transfer the rewards to the VentureOne. This way, you can take advantage of the issuer's travel portal and transfer partners without complex rewards structures or annual fees.\n\nIf you have multiple rewards credit cards, you might not be thinking about combining rewards. After all, it requires an extra step -- and oftentimes, the best credit card strategy is the simplest.\n\nStill, with Capital One, you can complete this extra step in under a minute, which may allow you to:\n\nFor most people, saving enough rewards for travel requires quite a bit of spending. And when you spread your spending across multiple cards, your rewards might exist in multiple currencies and programs. As a result, you might not be able to use all of your rewards earnings to book a trip -- unless you pool them together.\n\nI recently got the Capital One SavorOne just to convert cash back from it into miles on my Capital One Venture X. I spend around $500 on food monthly. The SavorOne earns unlimited 3 percent cash back on dining and grocery store purchases (excluding superstores like Walmart and Target), meaning I'll get around $180 in cash back annually. That's 18,000 miles I can move to my Venture X every year to redeem for travel.\n\nWhen you turn your Capital One cash back into miles, you boost the value of your rewards. With cash back, 1 cent will always be 1 cent. According to Bankrate's valuations, Capital One miles can be worth about 1.7 cents per mile when you transfer them to a high-value travel partner. That means that $100 of cash back you've earned with a cash back card can eventually become $170 -- or more -- to redeem for travel.\n\nCapital One might not be known for its credit card combinations.

Instead of carrying multiple cards and chasing rewards, he sticks to just two.\n\nThis might sound surprising to many avid credit card users and those simply interested in earning points or cash back on their everyday purchases. Using credit cards regularly or chasing rewards is not wrong, but there may be better strategies for everyone. As a self-made millionaire and author of the popular book \"I Will Teach You to Be Rich,\" Sethi's reasoning is both practical and eye-opening.\n\nOne of Sethi's core principles is straightforward yet sometimes overlooked. You should only use your credit card if you can afford to repay the balance in full each month.\n\n\"It may be incredibly convenient to swipe your card at every retailer, but if you don't pay your bill every month, you'll end up owing way more than you realize,\" he said in a LinkedIn post.\n\nBy limiting himself to two credit cards, including a credit card for travel rewards and another offering cash back, Sethi avoids overspending. He emphasizes that the primary purpose of a credit card should be convenience and security, not earning rewards.\n\nTracking rewards and credit card hacking to maximize points and miles can be very time-consuming. Sethi's approach is to simplify and free up time and mental energy for other things that matter, like short and long-term financial goals.\n\nInstead of exploring multiple strategies to maximize rewards, he says people can benefit from creating a conscious spending plan that focuses on allocating money to:\n\nSethi's strategy to hold fewer credit cards and focus on conscious spending can also benefit your investing goals. He refers to credit card interest as the \"invisible quicksand\" that holds a lot of people down financially.\n\n\"People think, 'I make $50,000, so why don't I have $50,000 in my checking?' but it's because of the stuff you bought three years ago because it had a shiny interior,\" he said on LinkedIn. \"The total cost of these purchases (and time to pay them off) is astounding when you pay the minimums!\"\n\nHe also reminded his LinkedIn followers to factor in the opportunity cost.\n\n\"Instead of paying off $10,000 worth of furniture for 30+ years, if you'd invested the same amount and earned 8%, it would've turned into about $27,000.\"\n\nMore From GOBankingRates", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

[Associated Press]\n\nCredit Card Delinquencies Are Up Year-Over-Year, But That's Not the Whole Story\n\nRetail sales numbers came in a bit lower than expected yesterday, with consumer spending inching up just 0.1% from April to May. It's another sign that consumers are starting to feel the strain of sustained higher prices. Many consumers have been keeping their shopping habits up by relying on credit cards, perhaps a bit too much. Economists have been warning for months now about the rise in credit card delinquencies. Wealthier consumers are paying off cards and paying down credit card debt, boosting their scores. But that lower consumer is increasingly falling behind on their credit balances and that's really where we're seeing the localization of the increased delinquencies. [Marketplace]\n\nWells Fargo Bet on a Flashy Rent Credit Card. It Is Costing the Bank Dearly.\n\nWhen Charlie Scharf became CEO of Wells Fargo, one of his key priorities was to expand the bank's credit card business. However, a high-profile partnership with Bilt Technologies is reportedly complicating this strategy. In 2022, Wells Fargo launched a credit card with Bilt Technologies, a fintech startup backed by big names such as Blackstone and Mastercard. This co-branded card allowed users to pay rent without incurring landlord fees and earn rewards points, resulting in over one million accounts being activated within 18 months, predominantly by young adults. Despite its popularity, the card is costing Wells Fargo up to $10 million monthly, as internal projections about cardholder behavior proved inaccurate, according to a report. [The Wall Street Journal]\n\nI'm an Online Gambler. Pennsylvania Lawmakers Are Right to Ban the Use of Credit Cards to Fund Bets.\n\nMy father was a compulsive gambler. I am a gambler, and I have occasionally used a credit card to find an online gambling account in Pennsylvania. State Sen. Wayne Fontana wants to prevent me or anyone else from doing that. He is right. The longtime suburban Pittsburgh lawmaker recently introduced Senate Bill 1159, intended to reduce some of the worst financial harm from gambling addiction. It would bar credit cards as the vehicle to deposit funds in accounts with any of the many online Pennsylvania casinos or sportsbooks. Credit cards would also no longer be an option to cover accounts playing the state's iLottery via phone or computer. Fontana doesn't want to take away anyone's right to bet legally. But he wants players restricted to using only funds they already have, such as through debit cards, bank transfers, or PayPal. [Philadelphia Inquirer]\n\nProposed Visa and Mastercard Swipe-Fees Settlement Is Likely to Be Thrown Out\n\nA federal judge said she was unlikely to approve a proposed settlement in a long-running lawsuit that alleges Visa, Mastercard and large U.S. credit-card issuers restrict competition over the fees merchants pay when they accept credit cards. Visa and Mastercard both said they were disappointed and that they still think the proposed pact was a good solution. The settlement, reached in March, would have brought an end to a battle between the card networks and the banks with merchants that have been suing them for nearly two decades. But the terms were criticized by big-merchant lawyers and trade groups that vowed to kill the deal.

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was a victory for business and banking groups challenging a key part of the crackdown by President Joe Biden's administration on \"junk fees.\" [Reuters]\n\nGoogle Ads Phasing Out Card Payments\n\nGoogle is notifying some advertisers that they must transition away from paying for Google Ads via credit or debit card by July 31 or face account suspension. The move is part of Google's effort to steer high-spend advertisers toward more automated payment methods better suited for scaling ad investment. Impacted advertisers will only be allowed to use bank-based payment options going forward: monthly Invoicing (Google's recommended approach) with 30-day payment windows or Direct Debit for Automatic Payments, where available. [Search Engine Land]\n\nMale Consumers Top Gift Card Buyers\n\nThe male consumer is the primary gift card buyer in the U.S. for the first time, according to a Blackhawk Network research report on consumer gift card and gifting preferences among U.S. consumers. The research also highlights the opportunities everyday gifting presents for retailers and how an industrywide shift to more sustainable gifting is resonating with consumers. While men and women are similar in the types of gift cards they plan to purchase in the next year (e.g., single brand vs. multi-brand cards), men tend to purchase more gift cards to electronics and video game retailers than women, who reported purchasing personal care and beauty cards more than men. Gift card purchases have also gone from a go-to last-minute gift to a planned purchase with 71% of surveyed consumers reporting their gift card purchases are planned. [Retail Customer Experience]\n\nBiometrics Cutting the Line of In-Person Payments Innovations: Mastercard\n\nMastercard is also introducing capabilities for consumers to add payment cards to their digital wallet by tapping it on their own smartphone. Merchants can also add tapping a card to a phone holding a digital wallet as an additional authentication layer. Payments with biometrics instead of a phone or card are also on Mastercard's roadmap. The company wants to let consumers choose how they register their payment method to their biometrics. Behavioral biometrics are also part of Mastercard's plan, in addition to physical biometric modalities like palm and face. [Biometric Update]\n\nFor Credit Cards, Smaller Government Is Better\n\nOne such policy that's being pushed in the US Senate is a bill that would create credit card mandates. A version of this very legislation was passed in 2010 and applied to debit cards. The results to the user were: lost debit reward points, lost access to free checking accounts, and some lost their local bank entirely. In addition to resurrecting a policy that history has proven to be a failure, studies have shown that applying this same concept to credit cards will come with a $5 billion price tag due to it expanding the role of the federal government in credit card processing. And, as you and I both know, when government's role expands, taxpayers are the ones footing the bill. [Winchester News Gazette]\n\n0% Credit Card Intro Rate Offers: The Pros, Cons and What Lenders Are Banking On\n\nWhy are banks and credit unions still offering 0%? Well, the odds are good that you'll underestimate how quickly you could pay off that debt, and you will get stuck with high credit card rates once again. The lenders typically get a fee for a balance transfer, and they lure customers away from competitors. Anyone who is banking on seeing their credit card rates fall significantly in six months or so, once the Fed begins cutting interest rates, is going to be sadly disappointed. Even if the first rate cut hits in September, and some say it might not take place until December, interest rates will gradually pull back, not plummet, from here. Shopping around to snag an introductory rate of 0% could indeed make sense, if you stop spending and aim to pay off as much of the credit card debt as possible in less than a year or two.

It has no annual fee and offers a generous rewards rate for purchases made at U.S. supermarkets, U.S. gas stations and U.S. online retail purchases since the card was upgraded in July 2022.\n\nThe Blue Cash Everyday is one of two main cash back cards offered by American Express -- the other being the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express, which comes with a $95 annual fee ($0 intro annual fee for the first year). Although these two cards offer fairly similar benefits, the Blue Cash Everyday is likely a better fit for cardholders who may not earn enough rewards to offset the Blue Cash Preferred's annual fee.\n\nHere's a look at the benefits offered by the Amex Blue Cash Everyday to help you decide if it's a good cash back option for you.\n\nTo start, the Blue Cash Everyday Card lets cardholders earn the following cash back rates on common, everyday purchases:\n\nNew cardholders can also earn up to $200 in statement credits after spending $2,000 in purchases on the new card within the first six months from account opening.\n\nThe Blue Cash Everyday offers a 0 percent intro APR on both purchases and balance transfers for 15 months, followed by a variable APR of 19.24 percent to 29.99 percent. This makes it a solid balance transfer credit card option, while also offering the ability to pay off a large purchase over time sans interest.\n\nThe Blue Cash Everyday Card boasts a couple of annual statement credits that could be worth up to $264. Those include:\n\nThese credits mean you'll get even more value from this no-annual-fee card on top of the cash back rewards, welcome bonus and zero-interest offer on purchases and balance transfers.\n\nAll U.S. American Express consumer and business cards are also eligible to participate in the Amex Offers program. In addition to each Amex card's given rewards and perks, Amex Offers allows members to earn statement credits on qualifying purchases from select brands. In the past, some of the brands have included PayPal, Best Buy, Home Depot, Samsung, Goldbelly and Instacart.\n\nCardholders can browse Amex Offers and choose which offers to activate before making a purchase, and it's possible you could earn more than 25 percent cash back on a purchase. It's important to note that each Amex Offer has a spending requirement and an expiration date. To maximize these benefits, cardholders should regularly check Amex Offers for promotions that fit their spending.\n\nCardholders of the Blue Cash Everyday have access to American Express Experiences, which includes access to exclusive presale tickets and entry into member-only events -- from Broadway shows and concerts to sporting events and one-of-a-kind art exhibits.\n\nThe Blue Cash Everyday card includes Amex purchase protection from accidental damage or theft for up to 90 days from the purchase date. You'll be reimbursed up to $1,000 per eligible item with an annual limit of $50,000 per card. In the event of fraudulent or incorrect charges, American Express also provides dispute resolution assistance.\n\nAmex also offers car rental loss and damage insurance when you use your card to reserve and pay for a rental. Not all vehicle types and rentals are covered, however, and liability coverage is not included. Coverage also might not be not available in select countries.\n\nThe Amex Blue Cash Everyday travel benefits are relatively bare bones, as this is more of a card for everyday spenders (specifically gas and grocery spenders) than frequent travelers. However, American Express offers a Global Assist Hotline to support its members whenever they travel 100 miles or more from home. Representatives are available by phone to assist with lost passports, translation services, missing luggage and emergency legal or medical referrals.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Amex Blue Cash Everyday has a 2.7 percent foreign transaction fee for every purchase made in foreign currency -- meaning if you plan to travel abroad or shop online with merchants based abroad, you may want to pay with a card that doesn't charge these fees.\n\nThe Blue Cash Everyday includes the American Express Pay It, Plan It program. The Pay It option allows you to quickly make payments for small, qualifying purchases under $100, while the Plan It option allows you to put purchases over $100 into extended monthly payment plans for a fixed fee. You won't be able to add purchases to Plan It if the purchase would cause your balance to exceed 95 percent of your Account Total New Balance on your last billing statement, cause your plan balance to exceed 95 percent or cause you to exceed your Pay Over Time Limit. Purchases made under either option will still earn rewards like any other purchase.\n\nAdditionally, the zero-interest intro offer on purchases applies to purchases split up into Plan It monthly installments. After the introductory period ends, Plan It purchases will include a monthly plan fee of up to 1.33 percent of each purchase amount moved into the plan (and based on its plan duration), along with the variable 19.24 percent to 29.99 percent APR that would otherwise apply to the purchase.\n\nIt's important to get the most out of your credit cards and take full advantage of what they offer. To maximize the benefits of the Amex Blue Cash Everyday, cardholders should first focus on offers that are time-sensitive, such as its first-year welcome bonus and zero-interest offer on purchases and balance transfers (if you need it).\n\nAfter that, it's important to plan out your spending in order to make the most out of the 3 percent categories -- and be sure to regularly check Amex Offers to see if any of the program's current offerings align with your shopping plans or habits.\n\nIf your spending habits are beyond this card's offerings, then you may want to upgrade to the Blue Cash Preferred Card and maximize its benefits. Want to know how to choose between the two? Let's do a side by side comparison:\n\nAlthough both cards have a $6,000 cap on U.S. supermarket purchases per year (then 1 percent), the Blue Cash Preferred's 6 percent cash back rate at U.S. supermarkets provides the chance to earn $360 in cash back annually (in addition to 1 percent on purchases thereafter). The Blue Cash Everyday, on the other hand, has the potential to earn only $180 in cash back (plus 1 percent on purchases after that) on supermarket purchases per year.\n\nFor a single person or a couple, the Blue Cash Everyday might be worth it. But for a family of three or four that spends more annually on everyday purchases, the Blue Cash Preferred could be a better choice, as it offers the chance to earn enough rewards to offset the card's ongoing $95 annual fee.\n\nThe Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express provides great benefits for the right type of spender -- those who want to be rewarded for everyday spending but don't want to pay an annual fee.\n\nOther perks include an intro APR offer and the benefits of simply being an American Express member: purchase protection, travel assistance, American Express Experiences, Amex Offers and more. If you're looking for a top no-annual-fee card with a generous rewards rate on gas and groceries, the Blue Cash Everyday is a great choice.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instacart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instacart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Best Buy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_rental", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car rental"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Home Depot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PayPal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Balance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Trading Cards", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading Cards", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.bankrate.com/2021/05/20103952/Untitled-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669067", "eventUri": "eng-9669067", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Photo: Carl Recine, Action Images via ReutersHashim Amla holds the South African Test record for the highest Test score of 311 not out. Photo: Reuters\n\nCAPE TOWN - It is not only England's Premiership football clubs that are currently actively involved in the transfer market, but so too the cricket counties, who are looking to land the prized scalp of Hashim Amla on a Kolpak deal.\n\nIndependent Media understands that South Africa's star batsman has been approached by various counties, among them a London club, to prolong his playing career on the English county circuit.\n\nIt has already been reported that Proteas fast bowler Morn\u00e9 Morkel has been lined up by Warwickshire, among others, to follow the likes of Hampshire duo Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw, Stiaan van Zyl (Sussex) and Dane Vilas (Lancashire), who have all recently forgone their international careers in favour of lucrative long-term county contracts.\n\nWhile they are all significant losses - or potentially in Morkel's case - to the national team's cause, none are even comparable to Amla's stature should the 34-year-old retire from international cricket.\n\nAmla is the premier batsman in the Proteas Test side, having accumulated 8 281 runs in 107 Tests at an average of 49.00.\n\nThe former Test skipper also holds the record for the highest score (311 not out) by a South African in the five-day arena.\n\nIn addition, he has 7 186 runs in 156 ODI matches at an average of 50.25 and is also the fastest to reach 2 000, 3 000, 4 000, 5 000, 6 000 and 7 000 ODI runs after recently breaking Virat Kohli's record.\n\nAmla has previously stated that he still has the desire to have one final crack at the 2019 World Cup in England with the Proteas, which is still two years away though, when he will be 36.\n\nHowever, Amla would no doubt have given serious thought to pursuing a Kolpak deal after the recent failed England tour.\n\nThe Proteas Test side are in a state of transition, with current England bowling coach Ottis Gibson reportedly set to take over from Russell Domingo as the new South African head coach shortly.\n\nAlthough Amla is known to be a keen supporter of Gibson's coaching style, it is well-documented that he developed a strong bond with Domingo over the years, often saying \"the coaching staff has been as good a coaching staff that I've had in all my years of playing\".\n\nWith Domingo likely to exit the national team, Amla could view this period as the ideal time for a fresh start for him too.\n\nEqually, the less-pressurised environment of county cricket could be attractive to Amla at this stage of his career.\n\nNot only does he have a young family to consider - with a third child having been born recently - but the Proteas Test opening combination is also not functioning at the moment.\n\nThis has routinely forced Amla to virtually open the innings and play in a role that goes against his natural attacking abilities, which has led to a profound impact on his success over the last couple of years and Amla's own high-level performances dropping as a result.\n\nProteas legend Allan Donald recently pleaded with Morkel not to sign a Kolpak deal, begging Cricket South Africa to \"give him what he wants\" because \"we need him this summer\".\n\nWith powerhouses such as India and Australia set to visit South African shores this home summer, expect similar talks to be had with Amla over the course of the next few weeks in the CSA boardrooms.\n\nThe only consolation for CSA may be that Amla has committed to the T20 Global League, where he is currently the marquee player of the Kingsmead-based Durban Qalandars.\n\nThe new competition is set to begin in November.\n\nAmla has previously enjoyed county stints as an overseas player for Essex - near London - and Surrey, particularly enjoying his time at the latter due to the \"vibe\" and \"atmosphere\" at The Oval in the southern parts of the British capital.\n\n@ZaahierAdams\n\nIOL Sport\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "id": "9299354", "details": {}, "date":

It further claimed that the 34-year-old is considering such a move keeping in mind his young family, and also his recent poor form in the Test series against England.\n\nInterestingly, the right-handed batsman had earlier stated his desire to play in 2019 World Cup. And this latest development will only make things confusing for the batsman.\n\nHe has previously played for Essex and Surrey as an overseas player. Amla, regarded as one of the most gifted and fluent batsmen ever, has so far played 107 Tests, 156 ODIs and 38 T20Is for the Proteas, scoring 8281, 7186 and 1070 runs respectively.

This was after several reports emerged linking Morkel and Hashim Amla with the Kolpak and speculating about their future were rife.\n\nIn an interview with the Titans' official website, Donald said, \"Don't reconsider your future. South Africa needs you. Your performances against England in the Test series were the best I have seen you bowl in a very, very long time.\" and added, \"Give him what he wants. Let him retire on his terms. We need him this summer. I have not seen him bowl this well for many, many seasons. There's no doubt, Morkel is world-class. It is just a shame that he did not take bucket loads of wickets in England because he deserved it. He beat the bat on countless occasions without reward.\"\n\nIt may be recalled here that earlier Morne Morkel had fuelled speculations about his future when he admitted that he was nearing the end of his career.\n\n\"After this tour, we'll see. I'll sit and speak with Cricket South Africa and see where they see me featuring. But I love playing for this team. It's not rocket science that they probably want to start looking, in white-ball cricket, at the 2019 World Cup. Am I going to part of those plans? If I can be around to help the younger guys find their feet, so be it. I'll do that. For me the main focus is this tour and then we'll go back and see how we go.\", Morkel had said.\n\nNoticeably, several South African players like Stiaan van Zyl, Hardus Viljoen, Daryn Smit, Rilee Rossouw, Kyle Abbott, David Wiese, Simon Harmer and Dane Vilas have already secured Kolpak deals with English counties in recent times.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App", "id": "9689592", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Let Morne Morkel retire on his terms: Allan Donald", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/07/morne-morkel-759.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 32, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 47}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "247", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Netflix"}, "id": "302687", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "id": "305608", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}, "id": "309559", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}, "id": "309560", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wicket"}, "id": "309565", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}, "id": "309576", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Allan Donald"}, "id": "316104", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Donald"}, {"label": {"eng": "Comcast"}, "id": "319091", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast"}, {"label": {"eng": "DirecTV"}, "id": "319917", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}, "id": "337147", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lord's Cricket Ground"}, "id": "344381", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's_Cricket_Ground"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hashim Amla"}, "id": "430221", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashim_Amla"}, {"label": {"eng": "Morn\u00e9 Morkel"}, "id": "469188", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morn\u00e9_Morkel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cricket South Africa"}, "id": "532981", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_South_Africa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kolpak ruling"}, "id": "920952", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolpak_ruling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hardus Viljoen"}, "id": "1292363", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardus_Viljoen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stiaan van Zyl"}, "id": "1316756", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiaan_van_Zyl"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Future"}], "time": "12:49:00"}

And by \u2018food\u2019 we do mean ramen, richly flavoured broth and wheat noodles, in particular here. And no one knows this better than the 15 customers of a cult ramen joint in Tokyo\u2019s neon-lit entertainment quarter who didn\u2019t just brave the heat of the spicy broth but literal fire too. A blaze broke out at the Shinjuku Kabukicho branch of Ramen Jiro on May 28, the Fuji News Network (FNN) reported. Footage taken by a customer from outside the shop shows flames rising to the ceiling and thick smoke clogging the room. But people sat on the counter and continued to slurp their noodles, which we guess is one way to get smoked ramen. The diners continued to eat the meals or wait patiently for their bowls even as the fire began (Picture: YouTube/FNN) The ramen chain has a cult status in Japan (Picture: YouTube/FNN) \u2018Despite the fire and smoke, the restaurant was operating as usual,\u2019 a witness said. \u2018There were about 15 customers, and they were all seated.\u2019 Only a chosen few actually got to eat their noodles in the end, however, with a customer telling FNN that he had travelled from Nagano Prefecture some 100 miles northwest of Tokyo just to have a bowl. \u2018I was looking forward to it,\u2019 the self-described Jirorian said. \u2018I was so close.\u2019 Staff initially didn\u2019t raise the alarm about the fire, according to witnesses, and evacuated them when the flames grew in size. The shop was shortly after evacuated and the fire was extinguished (Picture: YouTube/FNN) \u2018The fire started and the staff started to panic. It was scary,\u2019 a diner said. \u2018We were just going to eat some ramen, and we never expected to be caught in the fire.\u2019 No one was injured in the fire, according to the city police. Fire officials say the cause of the fire is unclear but are investigating. Ramen Jiro is all too well known among Japanese salarymen and students for its tough-as-nails noodles, chunks of pork and mountain of chopped garlic, so much so that the people who queue for a serving are called \u2018Jiroians\u2019. And these serving are big. Seriously, a \u2018small\u2019 bowl of ramen contains about 300g of noodles alone, a good 100g more than an average portion. Around one in five men in their 20s to 40s in the Tokyo metropolitan area are Jirorians, according to Shinshu University researchers. Even as flames could be seen tearing up the insides of the Ramen Jiro, sending thick smoke into the streets, loyal customers began to queue up outside the shop. \u00e6\u0088\u0091\u00e3\u0082\u0089\u00e3\u0081\u008c\u00e4\u00ba\u008c\u00e9\u0083\u008e\u00e3\u0081\u008c\u00e5\u00a4\u00a7\u00e7\u0082\u008e\u00e4\u00b8\u008a#\u00e6-\u008c\u00e8\u0088\u009e\u00e4\u00bc\u008e\u00e7\u0094\u00ba #\u00e6\u0096\u00b0\u00e5\u00ae\u00bf#\u00e6-\u008c\u00e8\u0088\u009e\u00e4\u00bc\u008e\u00e7\u0094\u00ba\u00e4\u00ba\u008c\u00e9\u0083\u008e#\u00e7\u0081\u00ab\u00e7\u0081\u00bd #\u00e7\u0081\u00ab\u00e4\u00ba\u008b pic.twitter.com/m8KfRgZENn\u2014 \u00e9\u009b\u00a8\u00e5\u00ae\u00ae \u00e7\u00be\u008e\u00e8\u00bc\u009d@\u00e5\u00b8\u009d\u00e4\u00ba\u00ac\u00e5\u00b9\u00b3\u00e6\u0088\u0090\u00e5\u00a4\u00a7\u00e5-\u00a6\u00e5\u0087\u00ba\u00e8\u00ba\u00ab\u00f0\u009f\u0090\u00ba\u00f0\u009f\u00a6\u00b4 (@Miki_alpha0330) May 28, 2024 Sharing footage of firefighters racing to extinguish the blaze, local host club worker Miki Amemiya, 26, wrote on X: \u2018Our Jiro aaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!\u2019 Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

{"id": 232010030, "title": "28 Wild High School Stories That Became Legend", "text": "28. And finally, this is elementary school, but I'm still including it. \"When I was in grade school, there were two houses on the top of this very steep hill. Our school bus had to go up this winding, weird road just to pick up these two sisters who lived in one of the houses. Well, one day, one of the sisters wasn't feeling well when she boarded the bus. She was sitting in the back, and as the bus started driving back down the road, she puked. It was disgusting. It was so bad that then her sister puked. The smell in the back of the bus made a couple of other kids puke.\" \"Most of the kids puked into the aisle between the seats, so there was now a flow of puke making its way to the front of the bus as it headed downhill. As it passed each pair of seats, at least one more kid contributed to the river of puke, which just kept going all the way to the front of the bus. Our bus driver, Jeannie, had no idea what was going on until this mass of vomit pooled on the steps for the door. She slammed on the brakes, stood up, turned around, yelled, 'What in the hell is going on here!?' and then immediately figured it out. I still remember the look on her face today, almost thirty years later \u2014 revolt, realization, horror, and confusion about what to do next, all in one facial expression. She radioed into the school to have as much kitty litter as possible available and that they'd likely have to call in someone to clean it up. So we arrived at the school after traveling the last few miles in this stench, and there was the principal and the school nurse. Jeannie opened the door, and it had become a literal floodgate, and I remember the nurse going running. We stayed in our seats until they figured out what to do\u2014they couldn't have all the students wading in puke. In the meantime, with the bus no longer moving and fresh air coming in, more kids started to puke. They eventually realized there was no getting around it and put down towels for us to walk on. Thankfully, nobody slipped and fell into the river. We all went to the gym, where they did their best to clean up our shoes, but that smell stays on you. I recall hearing that in some other classrooms, the smell made other kids puke throughout the day. I will never forget that day, nor will anyone else who went to that school. From that point forward, all the buses had spilled powder in a little box behind the driver's seat, and we were instructed to tell the driver immediately if anyone puked again. Nobody ever did.\" \u2014u/SpaceForceAwakens", "summary": "<h1>The Secret Service are involved in not just one, but TWO of these stories.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/6/22/enhanced/a3aded5dbcc3/original-8410-1717712803-2.jpg?crop=2988:1992;6,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahmarder/wild-high-school-stories\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahmarder/wild-high-school-stories", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/6/22/campaign_images/378cd9a569e6/people-are-sharing-the-stories-that-passed-into-l-3-931-1717712864-1_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:16:02", "author": "Hannah Marder,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "authors": ["Hannah Marder", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.596}

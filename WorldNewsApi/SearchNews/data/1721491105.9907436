For the moment, Nvidia can\u2019t keep up with demand from the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. These companies are gorging themselves on the chips, sending GPU chip prices skyward. \u201cFor Wall Street, their utility has given them another kind of power, turning them into assets that can backstop loans,\u201d write Asa Fitch and Miriam Gottfried for the WSJ. Over $10 billion has been raised using GPU chips as collateral. Startups in the AI space, while growing quickly, are not profitable. Thus, loan interest rates are in the low double digits as traditional lenders, which charge lower rates, have avoided the sector. Instead, asset-based lenders, which small businesses and real estate developers have typically had to turn to are providing capital for this high-flying technology niche. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to build and scale a company at the speed that we\u2019re going, it is access to capital that defines success or failure,\u201d Michael Intrator, CoreWeave\u2019s chief executive, told the WSJ. Over time, he hopes his company can obtain cheaper funding. However, for now, \u201cit gets us what we need, which is the powder to be able to move at this size and scale.\u201d Fitch and Gottfried describe the deal structure as \u201ca metaphorical lockbox, housing all of CoreWeave\u2019s AI chips,\u201d with all \u201crevenue the company generates from clients using those chips ... [going] first toward paying its lenders.\u201d Most accounts-receivable factoring structures work much the same way. However, the term \u201cmetaphorical lockbox\u201d will make a veteran lender scoff. \u201cWhen I started doing this, everybody thought I was nuts. Now people are starting to see the light,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Fisch, a principal at Argo Capital who has pitched one such deal. For readers wondering when the next market accident is about to happen, Robinhood chief brokerage officer Steve Quirk may be offering a clue when he told MarketWatch, \u201cPeople use [margin investing] episodically when they see a great opportunity or love a specific investment. But I think where the opportunity lies is, in addition to our current customers, we\u2019re seeing a whole lot of new customers that are more frequent margin users with larger balances.\u201d Almost Daily Grant\u2019s warns us that \u201caggregate margin debt outstanding registered at $775.5 billion at the end of April according to FINRA. That\u2019s up 23 percent from the same period last year and equivalent to 2.8 percent of 2023 GDP, roughly matching the output-adjusted figure logged at the peak of the late 1990s dot.com bubble.\u201d Those numbers are no match for the $936 billion reached in the fall of 2021, equivalent to 3.43 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Of course, lending and borrowing success depends on the strength of the AI boom. For the moment, the demand for AI chips appears insatiable. At the same time, big tech companies and startups can\u2019t seem to generate enough revenue from AI to justify the cost of the computing power that underlies it\u2014a story that sounds very familiar.", "summary": "Commentary For lending, as in all things, necessity is the mother of invention. No matter the rate, lenders want to lend and borrowers want to borrow, with both sides tending to overdo it.

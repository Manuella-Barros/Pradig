Peter Welch became the first Democratic senator to call for President Joe Biden to quit his reelection campaign.\n\nWelch penned an op-ed for The Washington Post that was published Wednesday evening that dubbed 81-year-old Biden 'one of the best presidents of our time.'\n\nBut then he noted that we 'cannot unsee President Biden's disastrous debate performance' nor 'ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night.'\n\n'I understand why President Biden wants to run. He saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again,' Welch wrote. 'But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so,' he wrote.\n\n'In my view, he is not,' the Vermont senator concluded. 'For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.'\n\nWelch listed off all the reasons why former President Donald Trump doesn't deserve reelection.\n\n'Trump is a felon. He is a pathological liar. He is a menace,' Welch said, adding that Trump will be 'emboldened' by the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation's 'Project 2025,' which Trump has distanced himself from, contains an 'extremist agenda,' the Vermonter argued.\n\nBut, Welch, said, the national conversation has swirled around Biden's competency and age.\n\n'Only he can change it,' Welch urged.\n\nThe senator added, 'I deliver this assessment with sadness.'\n\nHe pointed out that while Biden got a bigger percentage in Vermont than any other state in the 2020 race 'regular Vermonters are worried that he can't win this time, and they're terrified of another Trump presidency.'\n\n'We have asked President Biden to do so much for so many for so long. It has required unmatched selflessness and courage,' Welch said. 'We need him to put us first, as he has done before.'\n\n'I urge him to do it now,' Welch said.\n\nWith Welch's admission, now a handful of Democrats from both houses in Congress have pleaded with Biden to bow out.\n\nOverall, nine Democratic House members have said it's time for Biden to go.\n\nThe president has, so far, resisted.\n\nBiden was dining with leaders of NATO at the White House when the Welch news broke.\n\nWelch's op-ed was published hours after actor George Clooney, an influential Biden supporters, made the same ask with his own op-ed, this one published in The New York Times, Wednesday morning.\n\nClooney was one of the co-hosts of Biden's glitzy Los Angeles fundraiser last month - where one of his so-called 'freezing' episodes appeared to take place.\n\nBiden stuck around onstage for a moment and then was escorted off by former President Barack Obama.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed that the footage was deceptively edited, calling it a 'cheap fake' from the podium.\n\nBut Clooney's editorial suggested that the video contained the truth - that the 81-year-old had lost a step.\n\nThe actor wrote that 'one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.'\n\n'None of us can,' he continued.\n\n'It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020,' Clooney said.

Peter Welch (D-VT) became the first Democratic senator to call on President Joe Biden, 81, to drop out of the presidential race.\n\nBiden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is facing increasing pressure to drop his bid after a disastrous debate performance and multiple interviews in which he stumbled over his words and generally struggled to articulate his thoughts. While only a handful of congressional lawmakers have publicly called on Biden to step down as the nominee, there has been a veritable freakout among Democratic lawmakers and donors who worry the president will lose to Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"I have great respect for President Biden. He saved our country from a tyrant,\" Welch wrote in an op-ed published in the Washington Post on Wednesday night. \"He is a man of uncommon decency. He cares deeply about our democracy. He has been one of the best presidents of our time.\"\n\nThe senator went on to say, however, he is concerned about a second Trump term and said Biden is not the best candidate to prevent it:\n\nI understand why President Biden wants to run. He saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again. But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not.\n\nFor the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.\n\nWelch went on to slam Trump, who is \"laying out an extremist agenda,\" but that this is being overshadowed by questions about Biden's mental fitness. He added:\n\nI deliver this assessment with sadness. Vermont loves Joe Biden. President Biden and Vice President Harris received a larger vote percentage here than in any other state. But regular Vermonters are worried that he can't win this time, and they're terrified of another Trump presidency. These are real concerns of regular voters who I've heard from recently -- like a mom who counts on the child tax credit and seniors who rely on Medicare.\n\nThe senator concluded by reiterating his plea for Biden to step aside.\n\n\"We have asked President Biden to do so much for so many for so long. It has required unmatched selflessness and courage,\" Welch wrote. \"We need him to put us first, as he has done before.

Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said in a CNN interview Tuesday night that he feared Trump would win in a \"landslide\" but stopped short of asking Biden to step aside.\n\nFormer House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in a TV interview on Wednesday, also urged Biden to quickly decide whether he is running, despite Biden insisting he is staying in the race.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short,\" Pelosi said.\n\nOn Thursday, top Biden officials Mike Donilon, Jen O'Malley Dillon and Steve Ricchetti will brief Senate Democrats at lunch at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) invited them to address his caucus's concerns.\n\n\"As I have made clear repeatedly publicly and privately, I support President Biden and remain committed to ensuring Donald Trump is defeated in November,\" Schumer said in a statement Wednesday evening.\n\nThe position puts Welch at odds with his fellow Vermonter, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told reporters Wednesday that he believed Biden could win and has urged people to focus on Biden's policies.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Welch said he hoped Biden would decide to exit the race after he saw the polling data. \"President Biden has made it clear that he's all in, but the evidence continues to come in about how an uphill battle is turning into an up-mountain battle,\" the senator said.\n\nBiden has told Hill Democrats that he is running and wants the debate about his candidacy to end.\n\n\"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\" he wrote them in a letter sent Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cook Political Report analyst David Wasserman described Trump's lead in the polls post-debate as \"the most drastic shift in the race all year.\"\n\nIn his op-ed, Welch praised Biden for his years of service, saying that he has \"united\" the party and helped created a bench of elected officials who can defeat Trump. He called Vice President Harris a \"capable\" leader and also praised other unnamed Democratic governors and senators.\n\n\"I understand why President Biden wants to run,\" he wrote. \"He saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again. But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not.\"", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Donilon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Donilon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ricchetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Ricchetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Senatorial_Campaign_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/welch-biden-ZCQX3OI6CZAF3GWY3EEZKMJBHI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Welch calls on Biden to step aside from ticket", "body": "Senator Peter Welch of Vermont has become the first sitting Democratic senator to call for President Joe Biden to step out of the November presidential election.\n\nHe's the latest in a growing chorus of Democrats seeking to move on to another candidate, but the first member of the upper chamber of Congress to do so.\n\n\"I understand why President Biden wants to run. He saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again. But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not,\" Welch said in an opinion piece published by The Washington Post Wednesday night. \"For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.\"\n\nWelch cited recent polling analysis from the Cook Political Report which found that six battleground states have shifted toward Trump after Biden's disastrous debate performance. Some, like Minnesota and New Hampshire, are still expected to lean Democratic, while Nevada, Arizona and Georgia have moved from \"Toss up\" to \"Lean Republican.\"\n\nThe junior Senator from Vermont, Welch joins several House Democrats in calling for Biden to step aside. However, discontent is bubbling throughout the halls of Congress -- even close allies, like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi have offered less supportive stances than even one week ago.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short,\" Pelosi said when asked on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" if Biden had her support. When pressed, she added that she wants Biden \"to do whatever he decides to do. And that's the way it is.\"\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Axios reported that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is increasingly open to shifting Biden off of the presidential ticket, and Fox News reported that Senate Democrats are sharing increasing concerns with Biden officials.\n\nWhile many Democrats have continued to offer full-throated support, the calls to drop out have started to come from inside the house. An opinion piece by Democratic donor and mega-fundraiser George Clooney, published in The New York Times on Wednesday, also urged Biden to step aside.\n\nClooney recently hosted a fundraiser for Biden in Los Angeles, helping the Biden-Harris campaign draw in a record $30 million.\n\nBut, nearly two weeks after the debate, Clooney's support has shifted.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney said.\n\nWhile Biden has remained defiant in the face of increasing calls to exit the race, Trump has become emboldened, seeking to strike the president's most likely successor. His most recent rally saw him attacking Democratic leadership, and introducing a new line of attack on Vice President Kamala Harris, blaming her for both the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine and for increased immigration along the border.\n\n\"Trump is a felon. He is a pathological liar. He is a menace. And he is sure to be emboldened by his activist Supreme Court, which granted him near total immunity,\" Welch said in his Washington Post essay. Trump, he added, \"consistently put his own interests ahaed of the nation's,\" leading to the attempted Jan. 6 insurrection and failed plan to overturn the 2020 election; should he be elected, an extremist right-wing agenda is sure to follow, Welch suggested.\n\n\"The good news is that President Biden has united the party and created a deep bench that can defeat Trump. Vice President Harris is a capable, proven leader, and we have other electable, young, energizing Democratic governors and senators in swing states,\" the senator wrote. \"We have asked President Biden to do so much for so many for so long. It has required unmatched selflessness and courage. We need him to put us first, as he has done before. I urge him to do it now.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch",

Pat Ryan (N.Y.) in calling on Biden to step aside on Wednesday, adding to the growing list of lawmakers who are pushing their party to pick a different presidential nominee. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), one of the party's most important voices, also left the door open to replacing Biden earlier in the day.\n\nActor and Democratic donor George Clooney also urged the president to withdraw from the race in a Wednesday op-ed in The New York Times. Clooney said the 81-year-old Biden showed his age at a fundraiser even before his poor performance at last month's debate against Trump, undermining the claim from the Biden campaign that it was just \"one bad night.\"\n\nStill, even though Democrats' anxieties about Biden's political future at a high on Capitol Hill, many lawmakers continue to stand with him.\n\n\"The president can win and I think he will win,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told HuffPost on Wednesday, adding that he should focus talking about \"very specific ideas that are going to improve the lives of the working class in this country.\"\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said he backed Biden \"100%.\"\n\n\"If you really want to turn your back on the president like this, if you're ever in a foxhole, that's never made better if you start to panic,\" Fetterman said in an interview Wednesday night on CNN.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Ryan_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Ryan (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Blumenauer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earl Blumenauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/fa2ffc66145567fc68b2a64cee5d3255", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Peter Welch of Vermont on Wednesday became the first Senate Democrat to publicly call for President Biden to end his reelection bid.\n\n\"We cannot unsee President Biden's disastrous debate performance. We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night,\" Welch wrote in an op-ed published by the Washington Post. \"For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.\"\n\nWelch urged Mr. Biden to reassess whether he is the best candidate to beat former President Donald Trump, adding that the growing concerns about his age and ability to do the job have shifted focus away from Trump's flaws.\n\n\"Trump is a felon. He is a pathological liar. He is a menace. And he is sure to be emboldened by his activist Supreme Court, which granted him near total immunity,\" Welch wrote. \"But the national conversation is focused on President Biden's age and capacity. Only he can change it.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, reaffirmed his support for Mr. Biden on Wednesday night.\n\n\"As I have made clear repeatedly publicly and privately, I support President Biden and remain committed to ensuring Donald Trump is defeated in November,\" Schumer said in a statement after Welch's piece was posted.\n\nDoubts about the 81-year-old president's capacity have swirled since his debate flub nearly two weeks ago. Mr. Biden has blamed the poor performance on being tired and having a cold.\n\nMr. Biden has remained firm that he's staying in the race, while a number of Democrats in Congress have offered tepid support for his continued candidacy. Nearly a dozen House Democrats have publicly called for him to step aside, though Senate Democrats other than Welch have not gone as far. However, Democrats who have publicly called on Mr. Biden to withdraw say there are many more in the party who agree with them behind closed doors.\n\nThose who have stopped short of calling for the president to end his candidacy have expressed doubt about whether he can beat Trump. Before Welch's plea, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado gave the most critical public assessment of Mr. Biden by a Senate Democrat in the aftermath of the debate.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said on CNN, adding that the White House has \"done nothing\" post-debate to demonstrate a plan to win the election.\n\nMr. Biden faces two big tests in the coming days as he tries to calm the alarm within his party.\n\nThe president will hold a rare solo news conference -- his first since November -- on Thursday to conclude the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. Then on Monday, NBC's Lester Holt will interview Mr. Biden. The network said the interview would air in its entirety during primetime.\n\nAnother misstep by Mr. Biden in either appearance could further erode his support.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Holt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lester Holt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/10/9a3d5c31-83d2-4dd8-908a-918515fda25b/thumbnail/1200x630/691cd730fa5051e50bdb5685ef4430ce/gettyimages-2160727501.jpg?v=2287029998c5246c93d6dd038eb30603", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Despite his letter to congressional Democrats insisting he's staying in the race, prominent figures, like top actor and Democrat fundraiser George Clooney, for example, are joining the chorus of calls to end his campaign. Interestingly, too, the media suddenly has remembered how to do its job. In Congress, nine House Democrats have publicly stated Biden should step aside: Reps. Lloyd Doggett (TX), Raul Grijalva (AZ), Seth Moulton (MA), Mike Quigley (IL), Angie Craig (MN), Adam Smith (WA), Mikie Sherrill (NJ), Pat Ryan (NY), and Earl Blumenauer (OR). On Wednesday evening, a Senate Democrat joined the list.\n\nWriting in The Washington Post, Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Senate Democrat to call on Biden to exit the race.\n\nWelch, 77, began by praising Biden, saying he saved the country from \"a tyrant\" and \"has been one of the best presidents of our time,\" before he said the stakes this election are too high.\n\n\"We cannot unsee President Biden's disastrous debate performance. We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night,\" he continued.\n\n\"I understand why President Biden wants to run. He saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again. But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not,\" the Democrat senator added. \"For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.\"\n\nHighlighting what he believed to be former President Trump's flaws, Welch said instead the national conversation has turned to the president's age and fitness. And only Biden can turn that around.\n\n\"I deliver this assessment with sadness. Vermont loves Joe Biden. President Biden and Vice President Harris received a larger vote percentage here than in any other state. But regular Vermonters are worried that he can't win this time, and they're terrified of another Trump presidency. These are real concerns of regular voters who I've heard from recently...\"\n\nIn addition to anecdotal evidence, Welch pointed to recent data that \"makes it clear that the political peril to Democrats is escalating. States that were once strongholds are now leaning Republican.\"\n\nHe argued Vice President Harris is \"capable\" and said there are other swing state governors and senators that could also fit the bill.\n\n\"We have asked President Biden to do so much for so many for so long,\" he concluded. \"It has required unmatched selflessness and courage. We need him to put us first, as he has done before. I urge him to do it now.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leah_barkoukis@townhall.com", "name": "Leah Barkoukis", "type": "author",

aside", "body": "US President Joe Biden on Wednesday faced more doubts about his reelection campaign from lawmakers from his Democratic Party.\n\nLate Wednesday, Senator Peter Welch called on Biden to withdraw from the election, making him the first Democratic senator to do so.\n\nBiden is running for reelection in November, where he is likely to face off against Republican former-President Donald Trump.\n\nThe challenges come as 81-year-old Biden welcomes NATO leaders in Washington.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Washington Post, Welch pointed to Biden's performance during a debate with Trump in which the US president spoke in a brittle voice and appeared to lose his train of thought several times.\n\n\"We cannot unsee President Biden's disastrous debate performance,\" Welch said. \"For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race\".\n\nAlso on Wednesday, two more Democrat lawmakers from the House of Representatives, Pat Ryan and Earl Blumenauer, publicly asked Biden to withdraw his candidacy.\n\nMeanwhile, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stopped short of calling for Biden to stay in the race, saying, \"It's up to the president to decide\" whether to run.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi told the MSBNC broadcaster when asked whether she wants Biden to stay in the race.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" Pelosi said.\n\nHollywood star George Clooney, a major fundraiser for the Democratic Party, also on Wednesday said Biden should drop out of the race in a New York Times opinion piece.\n\nBiden has vowed to continue on with the campaign and has dismissed suggestions he is suffering cognitive decline, describing his debate performance as a \"bad episode.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Biden is expected to take part in a press conference with reporters, a moment for the public and the Democratic Party to gauge his mental acuity.", "source": {"uri":

Trump. He said the president's stumbles during the debate had only reinforced -- rather than allayed -- concerns about his ability to run a successful campaign.\n\n\"Age was a big issue going into the debate, and it was an opportunity, obviously, that the White House saw to put that to rest, and coming out of the debate, it intensified it,\" the first-term senator said. \"And that's a real problem.\"\n\nMr. Welch, 77, said his decision to call on the president to step aside was extremely difficult because he and voters in his home state \"love Joe Biden.\" He touted the 2020 election results, in which Vermonters delivered Mr. Biden the highest percentage victory of any state in the country.\n\nBut he said those same voters had deep anxieties about the future, fearing that four years under a second Trump administration would remove any chance of extending progressive policies championed by Mr. Biden and could wipe away the progress they have supported over the last four years.\n\nMr. Welch said it had become an existential issue for him to consider the threat of another Trump presidency, and that his determination was that Mr. Biden was not up to beating the former president.\n\n\"It's not the elites in Vermont who are talking to me,\" Mr. Welch said, brushing back an argument that Mr. Biden has made in recent days as he has defiantly refused to leave the race. \"It's the working-class mother who's got two kids and is hoping maybe we can get the child care tax back. It's kids who are working in AmeriCorps just to do cleanup and environmental work who are terrified that all the achievements of the Biden administration on the environment are going to be erased if we get a Trump presidency.\"\n\n\"It's a catastrophe,\" he added.\n\nThe senator said he is not blind to the risks that could come should Mr. Biden step down, but rejected comparisons to the meltdown Democrats faced in 1968, when chaos and violence at the party convention in Chicago contributed to then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey's loss in the general election that November.\n\n\"One of the achievements of Joe Biden is that he has unified the Democratic Party -- everyone from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin,\" Mr. Welch said. \"And what that means is that if we have to go through 'Who's our next candidate?,' it's going to be among people who are all committed to the Biden commitment to save democracy, the Biden commitment to the environment, the Biden commitment to women's rights.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriCorps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AmeriCorps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Humphrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/10/multimedia/10election-live-senator-welch/10election-live-welch2-cjkf-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Welch downplayed the impact of Biden's looming news conference at the NATO summit on Thursday, which some Democrats have acknowledged will be critical to show he has the energy and mental capacity to face Trump in the presidential election.\n\n\"You're focusing on a single event, because that's one that's coming up, and then there'll be another event next week and you'll focus on that. And what it suggests is that this question of aging capacity simply won't go away,\" Welch said.\n\nHe's not the only high-ranking Democrat politician who's concerned: former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) appeared to undermine Biden earlier Wednesday, while House Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is reportedly considering dumping Joe for someone else.\n\nNancy Pelosi's Latest Comments on Biden's Future Are Raising All Sorts of Eyebrows\n\nEt Tu, Chuck? Report Says Schumer Open to Ditching Biden, Endorsing New Candidate\n\nWelch may be the first Democrat senator to formally jump ship on the Biden campaign, but will he be the last, or will his move open up the floodgates for other senators to follow suit? Biden is desperately trying to stop the bleeding by scheduling a press conference Thursday and an NBC interview Monday -- the type of things he should have been doing all along but which he has assiduously avoided during his term -- will it be enough?\n\nBut we can't unsee the debate:\n\nDesperate Measures: Biden to Sit for Primetime NBC Interview With Lester Holt\n\nWhite House Clown Show Continues As They Announce Biden Will Hold a 'Big Boy' Press Conference\n\nThe dam of Democratic support may be crumbling, and if it bursts, there won't be a thing Biden can do to stop it. Welch:\n\nWe need him to put us first, as he has done before.

The 81-year-old presumptive Democratic Party presidential candidate for US Elections 2024 has been facing public ire for his advanced age and the alleged inability to lead America.\n\nSince his dry-as-dust, halting performance in the debate against rival Donald last month, Biden has faced calls from young Democrat leaders to step aside. Rumours suggested that senior leaders of the party were also pressuring him in private to do so. Now, a senior democrat, Senator Peter Welch, a long-serving member of Congress from Vermont, has publicly asked Biden to withdraw from the presidential race.\n\nThis comes as Democratic Party leaders challenged the US President to provide convincing evidence of a viable path to his re-election.\n\nAlso read | White House rubbishes President Biden Parkinson's speculations, refuses to elaborate on mystery doctor visits\n\nWriting for the Washington Post, Senator Peter Welch said he was worried about the November elections.\n\n\"I have great respect for President Biden.

He has been one of the best presidents of our time...But I, like folks across the country, am worried about November's election.\"\n\nWelch notes that the \"stakes could not be higher\" and said that Biden's \"disastrous debate performance\" cannot be unseen and that the \"valid questions raised since that night,\" cannot be ignored or dismissed.\n\n\"For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race,\" stated Senator Welch.\n\nWith this, Welch has become the first Senator to publicly call on Biden to withdraw.

In February, Biden mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico at an impromptu news conference he called to rebut a prosecutor's assessment that he had a poor memory.\n\nBefore the news conference, several top aides, including Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, will meet with Democratic senators at lunch in an effort to shore up support in the chamber where he served between 1973 and 2009.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Biden and Trump tied at 40% each. Other opinion polls have found Trump widening his lead over Biden.\n\nBiden has seen his fundraising advantage over Trump disappear in recent months, and some high-profile Democratic donors, including actor George Clooney, are calling on him to step aside.\n\nBiden has insisted that he is not dropping out, and party rules make it all but impossible for anyone else to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August unless he steps aside.\n\nDemocrats would also have to figure out how to hand the nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris or give others like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg a chance to make their case.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [],

We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night,\" Mr Welch, wrote in the op-ed on Wednesday. \"For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.\"\n\nMore prominent Democratic senators, including Virginia's Mark Warner, have reportedly been organising in private to pressure Mr Biden to withdraw from the race, but Mr Welch is the first to make an official public statement.\n\nFor the past two weeks, Biden and his administration have rejected questions about his health and calls for him to pass on the torch to a younger Democratic candidate, with the president arguing last Friday that \"I don't think anyone is more qualified to be president and win this race than me.\"\n\nMr Biden's position has not changed and he fully intends to lead the party into the election, aides said on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the president so far has avoided a calls for him to step aside among influential party members that might make his continued candidacy impossible, the new calls for him to step aside - delivered by Democratic lawmakers and prominent Hollywood donors - underscore how perilous Mr Biden's political position remains.\n\nHollywood heavy hitters including Netflix chairman Reed Hastings, superagent Ari Emanuel, heiress Abigail Disney, screenwriter Damon Lindelof and author Stephen King have joined the chorus calling on Mr Biden to drop his re-election bid. On Wednesday, actor and director George Clooney weighed in with an opinion piece in the New York Times.\n\nAllies remain deeply concerned about his campaign's viability and the risk it poses to other elected Democrats.\n\nSenate majority leader Chuck Schumer is open to replacing Mr Biden as Democrats' nominee, US news website Axios reports.\n\nThe New York Democrat is privately signalling his concern to donors, Axios said, citing three sources. He has publicly stood by Mr Biden even as other senators have expressed worry about the president leading the party's ticket.\n\nIn a brief statement later released by his office, Mr Schumer reiterated his support, which he said he has made clear \"repeatedly publicly and privately.\"\n\nMr Schumer invited senior Biden campaign advisers to come to the Capitol on Thursday to brief senators and directly address their outstanding concerns.\n\nFormer house speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier Wednesday said on MSNBC that Mr Biden should quickly decide whether to stay in the race, even though Mr Biden sent a letter to lawmakers Monday saying he has decided to do so.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Tuesday evening, Democratic Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado said that he told colleagues in a meeting earlier that he doesn't think Mr Biden can defeat Mr Trump.\n\nMr Bennet on Wednesday said he's \"looking forward\" to meeting Biden campaign officials. \"We should have had it 10 days ago,\" he said. - Bloomberg", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type":

We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night.\"\n\nHe outlined the threats he sees posed by a second Trump presidency and wrote that polling data has made it clear that the \"political peril\" to Democrats has increased in crucial states such as Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia since the debate.\n\n\"We have asked President Biden to do so much for so many for so long. It has required unmatched selflessness and courage,\" he said. \"We need him to put us first, as he has done before. I urge him to do it now.\"\n\nIt marks a significant shift in the conversation on Capitol Hill surrounding Biden's debate performance and fitness to represent Democrats in the presidential election. During Biden's debate against former President Donald Trump last month, the president struggled to articulate his pitch to voters, not finishing sentences or arguments.\n\nTo date, only nine House Democrats have publicly called for him to leave the race, despite widespread concerns expressed behind closed doors in both chambers.\n\nSenate Democrats are set to meet with Biden campaign officials Thursday. Biden has said he is committed to staying in the race and argued that he is the best person to take on Trump in the general election.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Page", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/10/USAT/74360398007-gty-2160760441.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2999,1687,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

He said Democrats cannot \"unsee\" the US President's \"disastrous debate performance\".\n\n\"We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night. For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race,\" Welch wrote.\n\nThe Senator further urged Joe Biden to reassess whether he is the best pick to beat former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump, adding that mounting concerns and talks about the 81-year-old's age, health and abilities have shifted focus from Trump's flaws.\n\n\"Trump is a felon. He is a pathological liar. He is a menace. And he is sure to be emboldened by his activist Supreme Court, which granted him near total immunity. But the national conversation is focused on President Biden's age and capacity. Only he can change it,\" Peter Welch wrote in the op-ed.\n\nPeter Welch is among a host of other Democratic heavyweights who have cast doubts on Biden's ability to run as President again. Former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Hollywood actor George Clooney have joined the calls.\n\nIn an interview with news channel MSNBC, Pelosi stressed that Joe Biden has a \"decision\" to make because \"time is running short\". \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" she said.\n\nClooney, on the other hand, a Democrat who co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser for the US President last month, also dropped his backing for Joe Biden with a strong opinion piece in the New York Times, saying he \"loved\" him, but he cannot win the \"fight against time\".\n\n\"None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" the actor wrote in the op-ed.\n\nDespite increasing pressure to quit the presidential race, Joe Biden has stayed firm on his decision to stay in. On Monday, in a strong letter to his fellow Democrats, he reiterated that he wasn't going to back out, adding that he would not be seeking re-election if he wasn't sure he was \"the best man to defeat Donald Trump in 2024\".\n\nFurthermore, in a recent interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, Joe Biden said only the Lord Almighty can convince him to stay out of the race.\n\nAmid concerns over Joe Biden's age, the Republican-led US House of Representatives Oversight Committee has summoned three senior White House aides, demanding they sit for depositions regarding the Democratic President's health, the panel said in a statement.\n\nIt has summoned First Lady Jill Biden's top aide Anthony Bernal, deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini, and senior adviser Ashley Williams, Axios reported.\n\nRepublican US Representative James Comer, the panel's chairperson, said in the statement that key White House staff must appear before the committee so that Americans can get the \"transparency and accountability\" that they deserve. He also called Joe Biden \"unfit\" for office and alleged his staff were not being transparent.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Ian Sams, however, called the summons a \"baseless political stunt\" and that James Comer was \"weaponising\" them to get headlines instead of \"seeking information through the proper constitutional process\", news agency Reuters reported.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comer_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Comer (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive Office of the President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/joe-biden-033654939-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=ma.cvOCHqc11LB0A9oiBed45u5Iivsu3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 371, "textEnd": 378}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

In February, Biden mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico at an impromptu news conference he called to rebut a prosecutor's assessment that he had a poor memory.\n\nBefore the news conference, several top aides, including Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, will meet with Democratic senators at lunch in an effort to shore up support in the chamber where he served between 1973 and 2009.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Biden and Trump tied at 40% each. Other opinion polls have found Trump widening his lead over Biden.\n\nBiden has seen his fundraising advantage over Trump disappear in recent months, and some high-profile Democratic donors, including actor George Clooney, are calling on him to step aside.\n\nBiden has insisted that he is not dropping out, and party rules make it all but impossible for anyone else to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August unless he steps aside.\n\nDemocrats would also have to figure out how to hand the nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris or give others like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg a chance to make their case.

Trump. He said the president's stumbles during the debate had only reinforced -- rather than allayed -- concerns about his ability to run a successful campaign.\n\n\"Age was a big issue going into the debate, and it was an opportunity, obviously, that the White House saw to put that to rest, and coming out of the debate, it intensified it,\" the first-term senator said. \"And that's a real problem.\"\n\nMr. Welch, 77, said his decision to call on the president to step aside was extremely difficult because he and voters in his home state \"love Joe Biden.\" He touted the 2020 election results, in which Vermonters delivered Mr. Biden the highest percentage victory of any state in the country.\n\nBut he said those same voters had deep anxieties about the future, fearing that four years under a second Trump administration would remove any chance of extending progressive policies championed by Mr. Biden and could wipe away the progress they have supported over the last four years.\n\nMr. Welch said it had become an existential issue for him to consider the threat of another Trump presidency, and that his determination was that Mr. Biden was not up to beating the former president.\n\n\"It's not the elites in Vermont who are talking to me,\" Mr. Welch said, brushing back an argument that Mr. Biden has made in recent days as he has defiantly refused to leave the race. \"It's the working-class mother who's got two kids and is hoping maybe we can get the child care tax back. It's kids who are working in AmeriCorps just to do cleanup and environmental work who are terrified that all the achievements of the Biden administration on the environment are going to be erased if we get a Trump presidency.\"\n\n\"It's a catastrophe,\" he added.\n\nThe senator said he is not blind to the risks that could come should Mr. Biden step down, but rejected comparisons to the meltdown Democrats faced in 1968, when chaos and violence at the party convention in Chicago contributed to then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey's loss in the general election that November.\n\n\"One of the achievements of Joe Biden is that he has unified the Democratic Party -- everyone from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin,\" Mr. Welch said. \"And what that means is that if we have to go through 'Who's our next candidate?,' it's going to be among people who are all committed to the Biden commitment to save democracy, the Biden commitment to the environment, the Biden commitment to women's rights.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriCorps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AmeriCorps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Humphrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

In February, Biden mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico at an impromptu news conference he called to rebut a prosecutor's assessment that he had a poor memory.\n\nBefore the news conference, several top aides, including Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, will meet with Democratic senators at lunch in an effort to shore up support in the chamber where he served between 1973 and 2009.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Biden and Trump tied at 40% each. Other opinion polls have found Trump widening his lead over Biden.\n\nBiden has seen his fundraising advantage over Trump disappear in recent months, and some high-profile Democratic donors, including actor George Clooney, are calling on him to step aside.\n\nHe has insisted that he is not dropping out, and party rules make it all but impossible for anyone else to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August unless he steps aside.\n\nDemocrats would also have to figure out how to hand the nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris or give others like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg a chance to make their case.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"},

Peter Welch Warns 'Peril to Democrats Is Escalating' | Common Dreams", "body": "\"Trump is a felon. He is a pathological liar. He is a menace,\" wrote the Vermont senator. \"But the national conversation is focused on President Biden's age and capacity. Only he can change it.\"\n\nPeter Welch of Vermont on Wednesday became the first U.S. senator to urge President Joe Biden to drop his 2024 reelection bid, adding his name to a small but growing list of Democratic lawmakers who have publicly expressed the view that their party's best chance of defeating Donald Trump in November is with a different candidate at the top of the ticket.\n\n\"Trump is a felon. He is a pathological liar. He is a menace. And he is sure to be emboldened by his activist Supreme Court, which granted him near-total immunity,\" Welch wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. \"MAGA Republicans, meanwhile, have clearly stated their plans for a second Trump term, laying out an extremist agenda with their Project 2025. But the national conversation is focused on President Biden's age and capacity. Only he can change it.\"\n\nWelch pointed to post-debate polling trends indicating that Biden's performance and continued presence on the ticket could harm down-ballot Democratic candidates and jeopardize the party's hopes of keeping both chambers of Congress out of Republican hands.\n\n\"The latest data makes it clear that the political peril to Democrats is escalating. States that were once strongholds are now leaning Republican. These new shifts -- in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia -- must be taken seriously, not denied or ignored,\" the senator wrote. \"The good news is that President Biden has united the party and created a deep bench that can defeat Trump.\"\n\n\"Vice President [Kamala] Harris is a capable, proven leader, and we have other electable, young, energizing Democratic governors and senators in swing states,\" Welch continued. \"Not only do these leaders have experience running and winning in tough political environments, they also have fundraising networks, media experience, charisma, and the ability to inspire voters across generations and across our big tent.\"\n\n\"We have asked President Biden to do so much for so many for so long,\" he added. \"It has required unmatched selflessness and courage. We need him to put us first, as he has done before. I urge him to do it now.\"\n\nWelch joins nine Democratic lawmakers in the House who have called on Biden to end his reelection campaign following his disastrous debate with Trump, the twice-impeached former president and presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) on Wednesday became the ninth House Democrat to urge Biden to drop out of the 2024 race, saying in a statement that \"this is not just about extending his presidency but protecting democracy.\"\n\n\"It is a painful and difficult conclusion,\" said Blumenauer, \"but there is no question in my mind that we will all be better served if the president steps aside as the Democratic nominee and manages a transition under his terms.\"\n\nBiden has thus far been adamant that he has no intention of dropping out of the race, and many Democrats -- including progressive lawmakers who have at times been sharply critical of his presidency -- have stood by the incumbent.\n\nAccording to a running New York Timestally, Democratic lawmakers and officials who have publicly expressed support for Biden easily outnumber those who have urged him to step aside.\n\n\"I support him and I am focused on making sure we win in November,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y) said earlier this week, a sentiment echoed by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).\n\n\"He's been the best president of my lifetime, and we have his back,\" said Omar, the deputy chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nVermont's other senator, Bernie Sanders, has also declined to join those urging Biden to step aside, even as he has criticized the president for failing to articulate a positive progressive agenda.\n\n\"I think he's done better since [the debate], and I think he's gotta do better again,\" Sanders said in a television interview Sunday. \"He has gotta say, 'I am prepared to take on corporate greed, massive income and wealth inequality, and stand with the working class of this country.'\"\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released Thursday morning shows that 56% of Democratic voters and 70% of Independents believe Biden should end his reelection campaign. The survey also shows that Biden and Trump are \"in a dead heat in the contest for the popular vote, with both candidates receiving 46% support among registered voters,\" the Post noted, numbers that are \"nearly identical to the results of an ABC-Ipsos poll in April.\"\n\nAmid the growing chorus of high-level and grassroots demands for Biden to drop out -- and with just over a month to go before the Democratic convention in Chicago -- some have raised concerns about the viability of the alternative path should the president ultimately agree to step aside.\n\n\"Democrats could be left with a deeply divided party, with different factions fighting over the nomination,\" political writer Susan Milligan warned in The New Republic on Wednesday. \"Even if the party quickly coalesced around Harris, they'd have less than three months to sell the public on her -- all while Trump, whose campaign has already dubbed her Biden's 'Cackling Co-pilot,' taps latent and not-so-latent sexism and racism to weaken her. The media would offer an assist with new rounds of vetting overshadowing Trump's own erratic behavior and lies.\"\n\n\"And Biden's cognitive state? It would still be an issue Republicans would use against her,\" Milligan argued. \"Even if he is not on the ticket.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common

Welch's bold move has sent shockwaves through the party, leaving many wondering if this is the beginning of the end for Biden's reelection campaign.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for The Washington Post, Welch argued that Biden's disastrous debate performance and his advanced age have raised valid concerns about his fitness for office. The senator also emphasized that, while he respects Biden's accomplishments, he believes that the president needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.\n\n\"For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race,\" Welch wrote. \"We cannot ignore the valid questions about his fitness for office. The stakes are too high.\"\n\nWelch's call for Biden's withdrawal comes as a growing number of Democrats are expressing doubts about the president's ability to win reelection. In recent weeks, several prominent Democrats, including actor and Democratic donor George Clooney, have urged Biden to step aside and make way for a younger, more electable candidate.\n\nThe news of Welch's op-ed has been met with mixed reactions from the Trump camp. While some are celebrating the apparent chaos within the Democratic party, others are urging caution, warning that Biden's departure could pave the way for a more formidable opponent.\n\n\"I'm not sure if I should be happy or scared,\" one Trump supporter tweeted. \"On the one hand, Biden dropping out would be a major victory for our side. On the other hand, what if the Democrats replace him with someone even worse?\"\n\nAs the Democrats scramble to pick up the pieces, it remains to be seen whether Biden will heed Welch's call and withdraw from the race. For now, the president and his team remain defiant, insisting that he is the best candidate to defeat Trump in November.\n\n\"The president is staying in this race, and he's going to win,\" a Biden campaign spokesperson said in a statement. \"The American people know that Joe Biden is the only candidate who can bring the country together and move us forward.\"\n\nWhether Biden's confidence is well-founded remains to be seen. In the meantime, the Democrats' internal struggles are providing plenty of fodder for Trump supporters, who are watching the drama unfold with a mix of amusement and concern.\n\n\"The Democrats are in complete disarray,\" one Trump supporter wrote on social media. \"If they can't even decide on a candidate, how are they supposed to govern the country?\"", "source": {"uri": "thebeltwayreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Beltway Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_crane@thebeltwayreport.com", "name": "Jack Crane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://thebeltwayreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Biden-confused-e1651367255791.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

In February, Biden mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico at an impromptu news conference he called to rebut a prosecutor's assessment that he had a poor memory.\n\nBefore the news conference, several top aides, including Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, will meet with Democratic senators at lunch in an effort to shore up support in the chamber where he served between 1973 and 2009.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Biden and Trump tied at 40% each. Other opinion polls have found Trump widening his lead over Biden.\n\nBiden has seen his fundraising advantage over Trump disappear in recent months, and some high-profile Democratic donors, including actor George Clooney, are calling on him to step aside.\n\nHe has insisted that he is not dropping out, and party rules make it all but impossible for anyone else to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August unless he steps aside.\n\nDemocrats would also have to figure out how to hand the nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris or give others like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg a chance to make their case.", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "GEO TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Peter Welch became the first Democratic senator to publicly call for President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race.\n\nIn an op-ed published in The Washington Post, Welch said too much was balanced on the outcome of November's election. He warned of an extreme agenda from Republicans.\n\n\"The stakes could not be higher. We cannot unsee President Biden's disastrous debate performance. We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night,\" Welch wrote. \"For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.\"\n\nWelch's call is the most prominent yet to underscore doubts about President Biden's ability to secure a win.\n\nEleven Congressional Democrats across the Senate and the House have now called on the president to withdraw, according to analysis by Scripps News. A further 28 lawmakers have raised concerns about President Biden's ability to win the election, but have stopped short of saying the president should exit the race.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennett became the first senator to share public doubts about President Biden's ability to win the election.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennett said in an interview with CNN's Kaitlan Collins.\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\" Bennett said.\n\nRELATED STORY | World leaders apparently questioning whether Biden could serve another 4 years\n\nConcerns also extend beyond Congress.\n\nIan Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group and president of GZERO Media, told Scripps News on Wednesday that several international leaders at the NATO summit in Washington have expressed concerns about whether President Biden could serve a second term.\n\n\"In NATO, these are leaders that like Biden,\" Bremmer said on \"The Race\" with Scripps News' Chance Seales.\n\n\"There's not a world leader that I've spoken with this week that believes that President Biden can serve out another four years,\" Bremmer said.\n\nRELATED STORY | Biden insists he's the best bet for beating Trump as allies weigh in", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurasia Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bremmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ian Bremmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a585a6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2961x1555+0+210/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F8a%2F1b%2F247460ed4766beb9ebcd5529f660%2Fap21326455355081.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz\n\nPresident Joe Biden will try to head off growing opposition within his own party on Thursday, sending out his advisers to meet with Democratic senators to shore up their support and holding his first solo news conference in almost eight months.\n\nBiden's re-election campaign has been on the ropes for two weeks, since the 81-year-old incumbent's stumbling debate performance against Donald Trump, his 78-year-old Republican rival, raised fresh questions about his age and mental acuity - concerns that voters had long raised in public opinion polls.\n\nThe past week has brought a steady drip of elected Democrats calling on Biden to end his campaign, citing concerns that he could not only lose the White House but cost the party control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nPeter Welch on Wednesday evening became the first Democratic US senator to call on Biden to step aside, joining at least nine Democratic members of the House of Representatives who have appealed to the president to withdraw from the race.\n\nWelch, a first-term senator from Vermont, said Biden should end his candidacy \"for the good of the country.\"\n\nSeveral high-profile lawmakers have said Biden should stay in the race, and many others, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have declined to say definitively whether he should step aside.\n\nThey will all likely be watching closely at 5:30pm Eastern Time (2130 GMT), when Biden is due to field questions from the White House press corps.\n\nAt his first formal solo news conference since November 2023, Biden will have to speak extemporaneously on a wide range of topics - including likely questions on whether his doctors have found evidence of mental decline.\n\nA White House official said it was expected to have a similar format to Biden's last solo press conference, when the president called on four reporters who asked about topics from defending Taiwan to deaths in Gaza and then answered a smattering of questions shouted at him.\n\nBiden may call on a few more reporters this time, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n\nHis offhand reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping as a \"dictator\" at the end of the news conference capped a carefully-planned summit with Xi, and drew an angry response from China.\n\nIt will be Biden's most unscripted appearance since the Jun 27 debate, where he appeared to lose his train of thought several times and stumbled over several answers.\n\nAn interview with ABC News last week raised further alarms when Biden said he would be satisfied if he lost the election as long as he tried his best.\n\nPrevious interactions with White House reporters have also backfired. In February, Biden mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico at an impromptu news conference he called to rebut a prosecutor's assessment that he had a poor memory.\n\nBefore the news conference, several top aides, including Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, will meet with Democratic senators at lunch in an effort to shore up support in the chamber where he served between 1973 and 2009.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Biden and Trump tied at 40 percent each. Other opinion polls have found Trump widening his lead over Biden.\n\nBiden has seen his fundraising advantage over Trump disappear in recent months, and some high-profile Democratic donors, including actor George Clooney, are calling on him to step aside.\n\nBiden has insisted that he is not dropping out, and party rules make it all but impossible for anyone else to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August unless he steps aside.\n\nDemocrats would also have to figure out how to hand the nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris or give others like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg a chance to make their case.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Biden has defiantly insisted he is staying the course, telling lawmakers this week he is not going anywhere.\n\nTrump, who has kept a relatively low-profile as anxious Democrats publicly and privately air concerns, returned to the campaign trail on Tuesday with a rally in Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will take questions from the media on Thursday at 5:30 p.m. ET, his first press conference since the controversy over his candidacy erupted following his debate performance.\n\nBiden has had fewer pressers with the media than his predecessors and the last time he took questions solo was back in November 2023.\n\nThe upcoming press briefing is being held at the Washington Convention Center, where Biden will spend a third day at the 2024 NATO Summit.\n\nJul 10, 2024, 7:35 PM EDT\n\nFirst senator joins growing calls for Biden to drop out\n\nSen. Peter Welch of Vermont called for Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race in a Washington Post op-ed published Wednesday evening.\n\nWelch is the first Senate Democrat to officially call for Biden to step aside.\n\n\"I understand why President Biden wants to run. He saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again. But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not,\" Welch wrote.\n\n\"I deliver this assessment with sadness. Vermont loves Joe Biden. President Biden and Vice President Harris received a larger vote percentage here than in any other state. But regular Vermonters are worried that he can't win this time, and they're terrified of another Trump presidency,\" he said.\n\nJul 10, 2024, 6:47 PM EDT\n\nNinth Democrat calls for Biden to withdraw from the race\n\nU.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., became the ninth Democrat to call on Biden to end his reelection bid.\n\nBlumenauer, a senior member of the House Ways and Means and Budget committees, commended the president for his accomplishments, claiming in a statement released Wednesday that Biden \"will be recorded in history as the most successful president in the last 50 years.\"\n\nHowever, the congressmen added that, in his mind, \"We will all be better served if the president steps aside as the Democratic nominee and manages a transition under his terms.\"\n\n\"The next six months will be critical in the implementation of President Biden's landmark accomplishments that will define his legacy for generations to come. He should devote his energy and undivided attention to issues of war and peace, the climate crisis, and rebuilding and renewing America,\" Blumenauer said, in part.\n\nJul 10, 2024, 6:39 PM EDT\n\nAFL-CIO calls on Democrats to unite behind Biden\n\nThe AFL-CIO for the second time in a week put out a statement in support of President Joe Biden after unanimously voting to reaffirm their support for the Biden-Harris ticket, saying that they are the \"most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\"\n\nThe union, which endorsed the Biden-Harris campaign in June 2023, urged Democrats to support Biden saying, \"The labor movement is united behind President Biden and Vice President Harris. We urge his party and the American people to join us.\"\n\n\"The message from today's meeting couldn't have been clearer: Right now, it's time to come together around a vision of a country where everyone has a fair shot with a living wage, affordable health care, retirement security, and time to do the things we love like spending time with family and friends and pursuing our interests and passions. These are fundamental to, as the president reiterated to our meeting, building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down,\" the AFL-CIO Executive Council said in a statement.\n\nJul 10, 5:46 PM EDT\n\nNewsom says he won't challenge Harris, reiterates support for Biden\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom was again asked about the future of President Biden's campaign and whether he'd challenge Vice President Kamala Harris if she took the ticket during a news conference on the ongoing wildfires Wednesday.\n\nNewsom stood by comments he made in 2023 when he said he would not run against Harris.\n\nThe governor reiterated that he is still backing Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\"I think I've had 100 media outlets asking the same question, and I think that I've amply answered my support for the president and the support I saw on the ground was demonstrable,\" he said.\n\nNewsom said he didn't read the full comments that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave on MSNBC where she said, \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run.\"\n\nHe also said he had not read George Clooney's New York Times op-ed that called on Biden to bow out.\n\nJul 10,4:48 PM EDT\n\nMorale 'very low' at White House as staff frustrated by Clooney op-ed: Source\n\nMorale \"is very low in the building,\" a person who works regularly with senior level White House staff told ABC News Wednesday.\n\nSome in President Joe Biden's inner circle, including senior adviser Anita Dunn and chief of staff Jeff Zients, are said to be very frustrated and upset by George Clooney's op-ed in the New York Times in which he calls on Biden to step aside, the source said.\n\nThe donor class is also deeply divided, a Democratic adviser told ABC News.\n\nAlthough small donations continue to pour in and the very largest donors are doubling down, the huge swath of donors in the middle are holding back, according to the adviser. That group of donors, which gives anywhere from five to eight figures, are on pause, which is very damaging since they're a major part of the donor ecosystem, the adviser said.\n\nThis adviser adds that the hand-wringing in the meantime has been very harmful to the campaign.\n\nAnother Democratic fundraiser says while a strong performance at the solo press conference Thursday could help the situation, many donors believe the crisis around Biden just won't go away.\n\nThe doubts raised by members of Congress, the comments from Nancy Pelosi, and the op-ed from George Clooney are all fueling a flurry of discussions among donors about what to do if Biden drops out.\n\n-ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang\n\nJul 10, 3:33 PM EDT\n\nBiden to hold one-on-one interview with NBC's Lester Holt\n\nPresident Joe Biden will hold a one-on-one interview with NBC News' Lester Holt Monday, the network announced.\n\nThis will mark the second TV interview Biden has held since last month's presidential debate.\n\nHolt will interview Biden earlier in the day while he's in Austin, Texas, and the full interview will air at 9 p.m. ET, the network announced.\n\nJul 10, 3:24 PM EDT\n\nRepublican presses top officials on Biden's mental fitness\n\nIn back-to-back House Financial Services Committee hearings with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, both regular, annual hearings on their agency's policies, Republican Mike Lawler of New York redirected from questions about inflation and tariffs on Russia to ask each official about their personal interactions with the president.\n\nYellen said she wouldn't describe the content of her meetings with the president or say when she last met with him because it was \"private,\" but she called Biden \"extremely effective.\"\n\n\"The president is extremely effective in the meetings that I've been in with him, that includes many international meetings that are multi hour, like his meetings with President Xi [Jinping of China],\" she said.\n\n\"Madam secretary, have there been any discussions among Cabinet secretaries about invoking the 25th Amendment?\" Lawler asked.\n\n\"No,\" Yellen said resolutely. The 25th Amendment states that the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet can together remove power from the president if he or she is incapacitated.\n\nPowell, asked by Lawler if he's \"noticed any mental or cognitive decline\" in meetings with the president, said \"no.\"\n\nBut Powell noted that he'd only interacted with the president twice in the last two years -- once for a meeting and once to shake his hand at a state dinner, which Powell said was normal for presidents and Federal Reserve chairs, given the independence of the agency.\n\nMultiple Senate Democrats spoke candidly with ABC News about concerns they have about Biden's viability and said they want to continue discussions about the best path forward.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said he is worried about \"an existential threat to the country if Donald Trump wins,\" and added \"every day is critical\" as Biden weighs his path forward.\n\n\"I have confidence in Joe Biden doing what's right for America. What he believes is right for America is to defeat Donald Trump and he'll be a pretty good judge of whether that will be possible,\" Blumenthal said. \"We can all advise him we can raise concerns ultimately the decision is his and I am going to continue to raise concerns but I do think we need to ultimately unify because the existential threat here is Donald Trump.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, associated himself with the comments of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi made on MSNBC Wednesday, in which she appeared to leave the door open for the president to step aside.\n\n\"I thought Speaker Pelosi nailed it pretty well this morning,\" Whitehouse told ABC News. He repeatedly avoided answering additional questions about whether Biden should resign before reiterating his support for Pelosi's comments.\n\nAlthough Sen. Dick Durbin told ABC News Durbin he was \"very concerned\" about Biden's chances, he added that he's always known the race would be close.\n\n\"I believe we wage the right campaign and make a point of what we've achieved under this president we will see him reelected,\" Durbin said.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who expressed worries about Biden's future during a closed-door meeting among Senate Democrats Tuesday, told ABC News he was hearing legitimate concerns from voters.\n\n\"My job is to listen to them my job is to go to hearings like this to fight for lower drug prices to fight for Ohio workers,\" Brown said.\n\nNew York Rep. Pat Ryan, a moderate Democrat, is now calling on Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Trump is an existential threat to American democracy; it is our duty to put forward the strongest candidate against him,\" Ryan wrote on X. \"Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump. For the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside -- to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.\"\n\nRyan is the eighth House Democrat to publicly call on Biden to step aside.\n\nDespite her remarks, Biden suggested he still has Pelosi's support to continue his reelection campaign.\n\n\"Is Nancy Pelosi still behind you?\" Biden was asked after taking a family photo with NATO leaders.\n\nThe president didn't say anything, but flexed his arm and fist in the air.\n\nAfter a day of closed-door Democratic meetings where lawmakers appeared to be absorbing the sober reality that Biden would stay as the party's presumptive nominee, new comments on Wednesday stirred fresh debate on Biden's viability and path forward.\n\nFirst, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was noncommittal on whether she wanted Biden to continue to run despite Biden insisting repeatedly that he had decided to stay in the race.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi said on MSNBC. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nThen, George Clooney, in a stinging New York Times op-ed, said Biden should step aside.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The president worked to assuage concerns early in the week, telling lawmakers in a letter that he's \"firmly committed\" to running and making his case for reelection. But that hasn't stopped what's been a slow drip of Democrats calling for Mr. Biden to leave the race in recent days.\n\nIn the upper chamber, where Mr. Biden represented Delaware for nearly three decades, senators have been more reticent. Some have limited their public responses to stating the president needs to do more to assure voters and the party that he's up for a second term. Until late Wednesday, no senators had called for Mr. Biden to step aside.\n\nSen. Peter Welch of Vermont, who expressed frustration with the Biden campaign in recent days and concern about Mr. Biden's reelection prospects, called for the president to drop out of the race Wednesday night, becoming the first senator to do so.\n\nIn an op-ed in the Washington Post, Welch wrote that while he understands why the president wants to run, having defeated former President Donald Trump in 2020 and aiming to do it again, Welch said that \"he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so.\"\n\n\"In my view, he is not,\" Welch wrote. \"For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.\"\n\nAlso on Wednesday, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said \"it's up to the president\" to decide if he's going to run, suggesting that the decision remains an open question, despite Mr. Biden's insistence that only the Lord Almighty would get him to drop his reelection bid.\n\nThen, actor George Clooney, a major Democratic donor, penned an op-ed calling on the president to step aside. Two more House Democrats called on the president to drop out of the race on Wednesday, bringing the number to nine.\n\nAmid the growing concerns from House Democrats, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries plans to convey the concern of his caucus directly to the president, multiple sources confirm to CBS News. Jeffries has been meeting with Democratic groups in the caucus this week.\n\nJeffries told CBS News on Wednesday that House Democrats are \"continuing to have candid and clear-eyed and comprehensive conversations with the House Democratic Caucus throughout the week,\" adding that \"we'll see where we go from there.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Donilon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Donilon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ricchetti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Ricchetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counselor_to_the_President", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counselor to the President"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/11/68dc0a4f-540a-4c84-bb60-70d26e9eb576/thumbnail/1200x630/1547e0c98501208626ca5bc593f8c4dc/gettyimages-2161388476.jpg?v=2287029998c5246c93d6dd038eb30603", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723096", "eventUri": "eng-9723096", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The meeting's announcement comes after several top senators, Jon Tester (D-MT) and Peter Welch (D-VT), among others, expressed doubt about Biden's chances.\n\nWelch is expected to attend the meeting after he called for Biden to drop out of the race, the first Democratic senator to do so.\n\n\"I understand why President Biden wants to run. He saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again,\" Welch wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. \"But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not. For the good of the country, I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.\"\n\nThere already appears to be some animosity as to whether the meeting will make a difference as Biden has firmly said he will remain in the race. At least one Democratic senator is skeptical the meeting will matter, saying it is \"a waste of everyone's time if Biden can't even come make the case himself,\" according to Punchbowl News.\n\nBiden has repeatedly said he will not step down in the face of those in his own party questioning his candidacy, along with donors and supporters.

In February, Biden mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico at an impromptu news conference he called to rebut a prosecutor's assessment that he had a poor memory.\n\nBefore the news conference, several top aides, including Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, will meet with Democratic senators at lunch in an effort to shore up support in the chamber where he served between 1973 and 2009.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Biden and Trump tied at 40% each. Other opinion polls have found Trump widening his lead over Biden.\n\nBiden has seen his fundraising advantage over Trump disappear in recent months, and some high-profile Democratic donors, including actor George Clooney, are calling on him to step aside.\n\nBiden has insisted that he is not dropping out, and party rules make it all but impossible for anyone else to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August unless he steps aside.\n\nDemocrats would also have to figure out how to hand the nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris or give others like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg a chance to make their case.\n\n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Andy Sullivan; Editing by Scott Malone and Deepa Babington)",

In February, Biden mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico at an impromptu news conference he called to rebut a prosecutor's assessment that he had a poor memory.\n\nBefore the news conference, several top aides, including Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, will meet with Democratic senators at lunch in an effort to shore up support in the chamber where he served between 1973 and 2009.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Biden and Trump tied at 40% each. Other opinion polls have found Trump widening his lead over Biden.\n\nBiden has seen his fundraising advantage over Trump disappear in recent months, and some high-profile Democratic donors, including actor George Clooney, are calling on him to step aside.\n\nBiden has insisted that he is not dropping out, and party rules make it all but impossible for anyone else to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August unless he steps aside.\n\nDemocrats would also have to figure out how to hand the nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris or give others like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg a chance to make their case.\n\n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Andy Sullivan; Editing by Scott Malone and Deepa Babington)",

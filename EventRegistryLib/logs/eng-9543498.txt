At the meeting, he discussed Ukraine's military needs with Trump and also met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson.\n\nAs noted, despite the fact that in Poland, where there are disagreements between the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and PiS, there is a \"rare agreement\" on the need to win Trump over.\n\nDuda's meeting coincided with a change in the former US president's and the Republican Party's policy towards Ukraine. Trump, who had previously spoken positively of Putin and condemned Ukraine's political problems, posted a completely opposite statement on social media a day later:\n\n\"As everyone agrees, Ukrainian Survival and Strength should be much more important to Europe than to us, but it is also important to us! GET MOVING EUROPE!\" - the article says.\n\nPolitico notes that Trump likes to be praised and respected in public. For example, PiS politicians always speak at meetings of American conservatives, and Duda was one of the few who did not congratulate Joe Biden on his victory in the 2020 election. Also in 2018, the PiS administration considered naming a base in Poland \"Fort Trump\" to encourage the White House to deploy US troops there.\n\nAs Ukrinform reported, earlier Polish President Andrzej Duda said that NATO countries should increase defence spending from the mandatory 2% to 3% of GDP, and Poland should change its National Security Strategy in view of Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump said that the United States would \"100 percent\" remain in NATO under his leadership as long as European countries \"play fair\".

GET MOVING EUROPE!\"\n\nDuda also met with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, with some crediting the meeting with helping the long-delayed vote on U.S. military aid for Ukraine.\n\n\"Duda is our Republican whisperer,\" Michal Baranowski, who leads the German Marshall Fund's Poland office, told Politico.\n\nConservative politicians close to the formerly ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party and Duda played up the apparent role he had played in persuading Trump and Johnson to take a more pro-Ukraine stance.\n\n\"A big round of applause for President Andrzej Duda, who has gained powerful resources to fight Russian imperialism,\" said Dariusz Matecki, a lawmaker of the Sovereign Poland party allied with PiS.\n\nBut others were less inclined to believe that Polish officials had such sway over U.S. politics. EU lawmaker Andrzej Halicki told Politico the idea was \"nonsense.\"\n\nAhead of U.S. presidential elections later this year and a possible Trump victory, his stance on Russia and Ukraine is cause for concern in European capitals, particularly Kyiv.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he could end Russia's war within 24 hours if elected president, without specifying the steps for reaching a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nThe former president \"made it very clear\" that he believed Ukraine \"must be part of Russia,\" his former advisor Fiona Hill said, according to The Guardian, citing an

We are and we have been (part of the West - PAP) irrespective of what was going on, whether Poland was on the map of the world or not, or whether it was a sovereign country or not,\" the president continued, adding that all attempts to impose Russian rule had always failed.\n\n\"They never were successful thanks to the tough spirit of the Polish people and our deep-rooted tradition, Christian tradition present here for 1,058 years,\" Duda said.\n\nSpeaking about the most urgent task facing Poland, Duda said that it was the necessity to build a modern army.\n\n\"This is our most urgent task. We must build an army - modern and strong, which will be potentially able to stop any aggressor,\" Duda said, adding that no one would dare attack us if we have such armed forces.\n\n\"Poland's sovereignty and independence should be defended at any cost,\" the president said, adding that this was the most important obligation for the country today, especially when \"a monster\" had been reborn, one of the most dangerous ones for Poland, namely, Russian imperialism.\n\n\"A voracious monster, a dragon, which had repeatedly devoured us in the past, has today been trying to devour the Ukrainian people, their land and their state,\" Duda said, expressing his gratitude to the Polish people for their support offered to Ukrainians.\n\nPresent at the observances were Szymon Holownia, Speaker of the Sejm, lower house of parliament, Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz as well as other government officials and army commanders.\n\nThe May 3 Constitution was passed on May 3, 1791, by the Great Sejm (grand parliament) of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and was the first document of its kind in Europe, predating the famous French Constitution and following the American one by only four years.\n\nIt introduced a hereditary constitutional monarchy (in place of the free election of kings), religious tolerance and the division of power into the legislative, executive and judicial branches, among other provisions.

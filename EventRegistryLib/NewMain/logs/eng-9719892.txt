The charges against him stemmed from public remarks that were harshly critical of the Kremlin. His arrest in April 2022, weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, came as authorities ratcheted up their crackdown on dissent to levels unseen since Soviet times.\n\nHis lawyers tried to visit him last Thursday in Penal Colony No. 6 in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he was serving time, but they were told that he had been transferred to a prison hospital for an unspecified \"examination,\" according to his wife Evgenia and lawyer Vadim Prokhorov. For several days after that, they were denied access to the politician over \"bogus excuses\" from hospital staff since then, Prokhorov said in an online statement Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, one of Kara-Murza's lawyers was finally able to visit him, Prokhorov said in a new statement. His health is currently relatively stable, the attorney said, adding that the exact reasons for the examination at the hospital are being clarified. Prokhorov didn't offer any other details.\n\nKara-Murza's wife and lawyers have repeatedly sounded the alarm about his health deteriorating in prison. In 2015 and 2017, Kara-Murza suffered two near-fatal poisonings and developed polyneuropathy, a condition that deadens the feeling in his limbs.\n\nProkhorov stressed in his statement Wednesday that polyneuropathy is a serious chronic disease that prevents Kara-Murza from serving time in a correctional facility.\n\nBritish and U.S. officials on Wednesday reiterated calls for Kara-Murza's immediate release, and expressed concern that his lawyers were denied access to him.\n\n\"Vladimir is being held in deplorable conditions in prison for having the courage to tell the truth about the war in Ukraine,\" Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow also said in a statement on X that \"speaking the truth and one's conscience is a right guaranteed by the Russian constitution, and which sadly continues to be oppressed by the Kremlin's ongoing and increasing crackdown on dissent.\"\n\n\"Kara-Murza is a hero, not a criminal,\" the embassy said.\n\nAsked by The Associated Press whether the Kremlin has any plans to release ailing political prisoners like Kara-Murza, akin to what President Vladimir Putin's ally Alexander Lukashenko recently did in neighboring Belarus, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday there were no such plans \"at this time.\"\n\nKara-Murza is serving the stiffest sentence handed to a Kremlin critic in modern Russia. He has denounced the prosecution against him as punishment for standing up to Putin and likened the proceedings to the show trials under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.\n\nHis wife Evgenia said he continues to be held in solitary confinement, a practice common for imprisoned Kremlin critics and widely viewed as designed to put additional pressure on them.\n\nKara-Murza rose to prominence as a journalist and has written columns as a contributor for The Washington Post from his prison cell. He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary earlier this year. He has been declared a political prisoner by Russia's prominent human rights group Memorial, and officials in the West have repeatedly called for his release.\n\nMoves to neutralize the opposition and stifle criticism intensified significantly after the start of the Ukraine war, including the passage of a law effectively criminalizing any public expression about the conflict that deviates from the Kremlin line.\n\nThe legislation, which outlaws \"spreading false information\" about the Russian army or \"discrediting it,\" has been used against opposition politicians, human rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin, with many receiving long prison terms.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

He was sentenced last April to 25 years in prison for treason after condemning the war in Ukraine. It was the longest sentence given to any opposition politician in modern Russia, part of a widespread crackdown on those who dare to publicly oppose the Kremlin and its war on Ukraine.\n\nHis wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, said last week that lawyers who had been trying to meet with him were told he had been taken to a prison hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk where he has been serving his sentence -- and that they were denied access to see him. That raised alarm bells, coming just months after the death of the opposition politician Aleksei A. Navalny in an Arctic penal colony.\n\nAfter six days without contact despite repeated efforts to see Mr. Kara-Murza, one of his lawyers was able to visit him on Wednesday, a member of the legal team said.\n\n\"Vladimir Kara-Murza's condition is relatively stable at the moment,\" the lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, wrote on Facebook, adding that his client \"suffers from a severe chronic disease -- polyneuropathy\" that is incompatible with the conditions inside a penal colony.\n\nMs. Kara-Murza welcomed the news.\n\n\"The reason for his transfer to the prison hospital are still unclear, but he is alive and, as always, alert,\" she wrote on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon. \"The most terrible things happen in silence and behind closed doors, so a huge thank you to everyone who worried and demanded that the lawyers be given access.\"\n\nMr. Kara-Murza, an opposition activist and a journalist, survived what he characterized several years ago as two state-sponsored attempts to poison him -- in 2015 and 2017.\n\nHe comes from a family of Soviet dissidents, and obtained British citizenship as a teenager.\n\nMr. Kara-Murza played a key role in lobbying Washington more than a decade ago for the Magnitsky Act, which punished officials deemed responsible for the death of a tax lawyer in a Russian jail.\n\nThe human rights organization Memorial counts him as a political prisoner, one of hundreds that it says are subjected to harsh treatment and inadequate medical care. It currently counts 769 political prisoners behind bars in Russia.\n\nFrom the maximum security prison where he is held, Mr. Kara-Murza has been writing an opinion column for The Washington Post and won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary this year.\n\nIn a recent column, titled \"I am proud to have spoken out against Putin's crimes in Ukraine,\" he compared Russia today to the dystopia in George Orwell's novel \"1984.\"\n\n\"'War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is power,'\" he wrote. \"This slogan on the facade of Orwell's Ministry of Truth very accurately reflects the principle of functioning of today's Russian government.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Kara-Murza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Kara-Murza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penal colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dissident"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siberia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omsk", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magnitsky Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Orwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_dissidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet dissidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political prisoner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/10/multimedia/Kara-Murza-qlgm/Kara-Murza-qlgm-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719892", "eventUri": "eng-9719892", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

of one of President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics after he was transferred to a prison hospital last week.\n\nHis wife Evgenia Kara-Murza has said his lawyers were denied access to him for two days and she has had no information on his condition.\n\n\"It is absolutely unacceptable to deliberately prevent a family from knowing why their loved one is in hospital and what his current state of

the Russian authorities to grant Kara-Murza's lawyers access to him in hospital.\n\nShe noted that after the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison colony in February, \"there are widespread fears that the Russian regime is arranging for its most prominent critics to die behind bars\".\n\nKara-Murza campaigned against Putin for years and stayed inside the country to criticise the military offensive in Ukraine even as Moscow passed a raft of anti-dissent and military censorship laws.\n\nHundreds have been prosecuted under the measures and most Russian opposition figures not in jail have fled into exile.\n\nThe Kremlin critic suffers from a nerve disease after he fell severely ill in 2015 and 2017 in what he says were poisonings orchestrated by Russia's FSB security service.\n\nAn investigation by several media outlets including Bellingcat, The Insider and Der Spiegel suggested that the FSB was involved in both cases.\n\nKara-Murza's polyneuropathy \"severely deteriorated during his detention and imprisonment\", Aevarsdottir said.\n\nThe PACE rapporteur urged Britain and the United States to inquire after Kara-Murza's health and work to secure the release of the Russian-UK dual national.\n\nIn early May, Kara-Murza won a Pulitzer Prize for his dispatches from his prison cell, which the jury said were written at the risk of his life.\n\nThe Council of Europe is an international organisation that brings together the 46 signatory states of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nBased in Strasbourg, its various bodies ensure that these rights are applied across the continent.\n\nmlx/sbk/jxb", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

{"id": 239767288, "title": "Usman names fighter who scared him", "text": "Former UFC welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman, revealed that Jorge Masvidal was the fighter who rattled him the most before entering the Octagon. Despite being one of the most feared fighters in the welterweight division, Usman admitted to feeling afraid during his title run. The fighter who instilled the most fear in \u201cThe Nigerian Nightmare\u201d was Masvidal, who had significant hype going into their first title fight in 2020. Masvidal earned the 2019 \u2018Fighter of the Year\u2019 title with victories over Darren Till, Ben Askren, and Nate Diaz, becoming the UFC\u2019s first-ever BMF Champion with a doctor\u2019s stoppage TKO. His record-breaking 5-second flying knee KO of the undefeated Askren stood out as one of the most violent knockouts, leaving Askren unconscious for nearly three minutes. \u201cI say one of the most violent (knockouts) because of, he was out for almost like two, three minutes,\u201d Usman said of Masvidal\u2019s KO on \u2018Pound 4 Pound\u2019. \u201cHe was out. I remember I was there. I remember watching like, \u2018He\u2019s still stiff. Not only is he out, but he\u2019s still stiff.\u2019 Then, all that happens, that was 2019 and then I think maybe a year later you and I fight\u2026\u201d Usman and Masvidal first clashed at UFC 251 under \u201cthe craziest circumstances\u201d after title challenger Gilbert Burns withdrew due to COVID-19. Masvidal replaced him on six days\u2019 notice, flying across the world to fight Usman on the UFC\u2019s \u2018Fight Island\u2019 in Abu Dhabi. Although it was Usman\u2019s third UFC title fight, the champion felt uneasy heading into this unexpected and risky title defense against Masvidal. The Askren knockout played continuously on every channel and social media platform, adding to Usman\u2019s nerves. \u201cOf course, we get nervous for every fight, but one of the first times it got to me, everything around me got to me because, bro, they\u2019re playing your viral knockout, one of the most viral knockouts ever,\u201d Usman said of the Askren knockout. \u201c(Masvidal) f***ing gets to me,\u201d Usman continued. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh s**t, is he gonna baptize me? What the f**k is it? I\u2019m in a hotel and I\u2019m super nervous for this, especially that \u2013 that moment before you go to the arena for the fight, and I\u2019m in my room just like, \u2018Why the f**k am I so nervous right now? Get it together\u2026\u2019 I would say that was probably one of the most nerve-wracking fights that I had.\u201d Usman overcame his fears to win a dominant unanimous decision over Masvidal at UFC 251. After going the distance with \u201cGamebred\u201d in 2020, the welterweights met again in a rematch a year later.", "summary": "<p>Former UFC welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman, revealed that Jorge Masvidal was the fighter who rattled him the most before entering the Octagon.

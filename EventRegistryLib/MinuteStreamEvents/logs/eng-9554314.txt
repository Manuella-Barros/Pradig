As noted, the climate is changing and its impact is already being felt: the weather is becoming more erratic, air temperatures are rising, hydrological regimes are changing, and adverse weather phenomena such as droughts, mudslides, heat and cold waves, strong winds, intense precipitation and dust storms are becoming more frequent. The climate change is now affecting many developing countries that lack the social, technological and financial resources to adapt. Millions of people are already facing water and food shortages, as well as increasing climate risks that threaten public health.\n\nIt is an undeniable fact that Central Asian countries are the most exposed and vulnerable to climate change. The air temperature here is rising 1.7 times faster than the average on the planet, which leads to a reduction in the area of glaciers, the volume of which has decreased by almost 32% over the past 50 years. This entails a decrease in river flows and poses risks to the region's food and energy security. The region is already experiencing increasing water scarcity (water availability per capita in Central Asia has halved from 3,500 m3 to 1,630 m3), increasing duration of heat waves, changes in precipitation patterns and intensity, and as a result, deterioration in the quality of fertile land, as well as rapid desertification processes, which irreversibly lead to an increase in the frequency of dust and sandstorms in areas not previously exposed to these phenomena.\n\nAs noted, in this context, the transition to a 'green economy' and the fight against climate change, mitigation of its impact, protection of atmospheric air, and expansion of green spaces have become a priority within the framework of reforms in the sphere of state and social construction, which have been consistently and step by step implemented in Uzbekistan.\n\n\"Climate change requires Central Asian countries to develop long-term strategies, concepts, programmes and action plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation. In the absence of additional resource conservation and adaptation measures, countries may face a number of challenges leading to unsustainable agricultural production and threatening the food security of countries in the region,\" noted in his speech Anas Fayyad Qarman, UNDP Resident Representative a.i. in Uzbekistan\n\nIt was also noted that there is a need to plan and implement actions to mitigate potential climate change threats. All of this - the planning and expected outcomes of actions - should be reflected in local, regional and national adaptation plans.\n\nIt was also noted, that the Green Climate Fund (GCF) provides financial support to fulfill countries' commitments to the Paris Agreement to develop National Adaptation Plans. The conference presented the results of project activities in Central Asian countries and discussed approaches to developing adaptation plans for the economic sectors most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nFollowing the Conference Agenda, the climate change adaptation was discussed by relevant sessions - water, agriculture, health, construction sectors and disaster risk reduction.\n\nAdaptation finance was also discussed on the sidelines of the conference. The thematic session explored opportunities for engaging the private sector and innovative adaptation financing mechanisms.\n\nThe conference resulted in the adoption of recommendations for the development of a National Adaptation Plan and raising awareness of climate change adaptation measures among the general public.\n\nThe conference was organized under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Hydrometeorological Service Agency (Uzhydromet) of the Ministry of Ecology, Environmental Protection and Climate Change of the Republic of Uzbekistan Project \"Sector driven National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to advance medium- and long-term adaptation planning in Uzbekistan\".\n\nThe governments of Central Asian countries pay special attention to mitigating the climate change impact on the economy and livelihoods, as well as to climate change adaptation. The countries have unconditionally ratified the Paris Agreement, thereby making certain commitments to reduce specific greenhouse gas emissions and integrate adaptation policies into development strategies. The Paris Agreement makes clear the need to limit global temperature rise through mitigation and implement adaptation mechanisms, and the need for all Parties to participate in these efforts. Adaptation is seen both as a matter of planning and implementation at the national level, and as a matter of promotion, reporting and assessment of progress at the international level.\n\nRatification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (Paris, December 12, 2015) enables activities to be based on international requirements. Under the Paris Agreement, Uzbekistan pledged to reduce GHG emissions per unit of GDP by 35% from 2010 to 2030. The renewed commitments include national sustainable development goals as well as social and economic development goals, depending on current national circumstances. The nationwide project 'Yashil Makon', launched on the initiative of the President of our country, enjoys wide public support and under which 200 million saplings are planted in the country annually.\n\nArticle 7 of the Paris Agreement explicitly requires Parties to assess the climate change impact on different systems and their vulnerability, and have national adaptation plans. Moreover, the Agreement provides for full reporting by countries at the international level on adaptation measures taken, their implementation and effectiveness.", "source": {"uri": "uzdaily.com",

The NAPs, or National Adaptation Plans, are the cornerstones of the mission to expedite adaptation. And this expo has been giving space to share experiences, views and progress across the world since 2013. But even after over a decade of negotiations through the UNFCCC process, the world has failed to produce a complete adaptation framework to track our adaptation actions.\n\nIn 2013, the African Group of Negotiators Experts Support (AGNES) proposed the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), which was established through the Paris Agreement at COP21 in 2015. The purpose of a universal adaptation framework was to speed up adaptation action and fund flow at the same level of mitigation. Sadly, the latest Adaptation Gap Report reveals that, while all the developing countries need $215-387 billion annually to support adaptation, 90-95 percent of this money has never been seen.\n\nAt COP28 (2023) in Dubai, a framework on the GGA called the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience was approved. This framework includes climate change impact, vulnerability and risk assessments, as well as national-level planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and learning mechanisms. But it is missing some important elements, such as measurable indicators to track adaptation actions and the progress towards global goals. Such global indicators are tricky since adaptation is context-specific. The team working on the GGA will now fill in such gaps and return to COP30 (2025) with a complete framework.\n\nBut, being the \"adaptation capital of the world\" and a pioneer in community-based adaptation, can Bangladesh show a path to set adaptation indicators?\n\nBangladesh's NAP (NAP2050) has a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan, listing 290 possible indicators (some are same or similar) against 28 outcomes of 23 strategic actions under six goals -- very comprehensive indeed. Almost all of these indicators are relevant to the sector an outcome belongs to. For example, under the food and livelihood security goal (Goal 2), the outcome related to climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has indicators like number of organic farms and extent of the adoption of CSA practices. How effective these proposed indicators are in measuring adaptation action is yet to be tested. But are they good enough to measure equity and justice in adaptation action?\n\nThis question may seem academic, but it also has a deep, practical reason behind it. Climate change affects different groups of people differently -- thus it creates further inequity in an already unjust society. So, when we build people's resilience against climate change, on the one hand, we need to reduce the unequal burden that climate change brings upon them. On the other hand, we should ensure equity in the distribution of adaptation benefits. These two aspects together define \"just resilience,\" a concept that may also be called \"leaving no one behind\" in climate change discourse. In mitigation, we talk about \"just transition\" or \"Just energy transition,\" where equity is ensured among people who would be affected during a shift from fossil fuel-driven economy to a renewable energy-driven one. While the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP) strongly envisages just transition by 2030, we don't explicitly bring in just resilience in our climate change conversations. But if we dig deeper into the 290 indicators of NAP2050, many talk about inclusive adaptation action by considering gender, age and disability segregated data, accessibility to infrastructure, poverty incidences, and social conflict resolution. Many other indicators focus on gender, youth, diverse gender identities, disability in agricultural practices, co-management initiatives, field demonstrations, and awareness-building of modern technologies. A few underscores resilient WASH facilities for urban poor, and women and youth-led entrepreneurship in adaptation.\n\nWe, however, need a thorough analysis of what just resilience should mean for Bangladesh. It can be done by identifying equity and justice in the Delta Plan 2100, Perspective Plan of Bangladesh 2020-2041, Climate Fiscal Framework, NAP2050, and MCPP. We then need to measure equity and justice in our resilience-building efforts by contextualising available adaptation protocols. One practical starting point would be the eight principles of Locally Led Adaptation (LLA). These principles can guide us on how equity could be mainstreamed into understanding climate change impact, identifying and prioritising collaborative adaptation action, inclusive decision-making, flexible project designing, financing those initiatives, and sustaining the same actions with transparency, accountability, local knowledge and capacity.\n\nThrough these immediate actions, Bangladesh can effectively contribute to the conversations of just resilience as the GGA framework gets finalised in the coming months.\n\nDr Haseeb Md Irfanullah is an independent consultant working on environment, climate change and research system, and a visiting research fellow at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB).

We need protection", "body": "Climate change is not merely an environmental predicament -- it is a matter of social justice. Our transition to a sustainable future can only succeed if it brings people hope for the future and leaves no one behind, MEPs Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez and Mohammed Chahim write.\n\nAmidst the relentless onslaught of extreme weather events, it is no longer enough -- though crucial as it is -- to mitigate climate change.\n\nWe also need to learn to live with the consequences, which are happening here and now and affecting the most vulnerable European citizens and regions the hardest.\n\nRecent findings from the European Environment Agency reveal that Europe is the fastest-warming continent on the planet.\n\nClimate hazards are affecting everything from energy and food security to ecosystems, infrastructure and public health.\n\nIn the European Union alone, floods, devastating wildfires, scorching heatwaves and prolonged droughts have already inflicted staggering economic losses exceeding \u20ac650 billion since 1980, claiming 195,000 lives.\n\nAccording to the same agency, around \u20ac520bn per year is needed to reach the climate-neutrality goal by 2050 and to implement the Green Deal.\n\nClimate change exacerbates existing inequalities as the burden of climate change disproportionately harms marginalised communities and regions, making them more susceptible to the impacts of climate-related disasters, food insecurity and economic instability.\n\nLower-income European countries bear the brunt, with higher fatality rates and greater economic tolls on their GDP. And the grim forecast indicates these disasters and social injustices will only intensify.\n\nAt the same time, the super-rich are driving climate change. The richest 10% of the global population is responsible for around 50% of all emissions. Therefore, reducing inequality is essential to tackling the climate crisis.\n\nOur continent finds itself ill-prepared to confront these mounting threats. That is why, alongside ambitious climate mitigation efforts, we must enact adaptation policies to shield every European from the costly fallout.\n\nThose least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions should not bear the greatest burdens of transitioning away from fossil fuels. We need social-ecological protection.\n\nCentral to this vision is our call for developing a comprehensive EU adaptation law -- one that is cohesive, forward-thinking and legally binding.\n\nWhile the current EU adaptation strategy marks a crucial starting point, it lacks the precision and enforceability needed to deliver tangible results.\n\nOur proposed adaptation law must set clear, measurable targets and adopt a holistic approach that tackles underlying social, economic and environmental injustices head-on.\n\nThe EU adaptation law will have to focus on investing in natural solutions -- the cheapest way to fight global warming while minimising its impacts on cities and rural areas.\n\nPlanting trees in cities will reduce heat islands and allow citizens to breathe again, and investing in soil, water and biodiversity protection will help farmers cope with the harmful effects of climate change.\n\nLike the Loss and Damage Fund at the global level, the law must prioritise the most economically disadvantaged and climate-vulnerable regions of Europe. These regions are hardest hit and not equipped to bear the costs alone.\n\nSufficient funding for adaptation is another essential element. People who are uninsured or not well-insured are losing their homes because of floods or forest fires, and they need to be protected.\n\nHence, we advocate for the establishment of a European Insurance Climate Fund, financed by markets and insurance companies, to bolster the resilience of European people and businesses against climate-related impacts.\n\nWe must step up climate risk assessment on the financial market and ensure financial actors take responsibility for people and the planet. We will also need to redirect sufficient funds from the EU budget and the European Investment Bank towards financing just adaptation policies beyond climate mitigation.\n\nFiscal policy plays an important role in climate mitigation and adaptation of both revenue and expenditure policy. Large corporations, big polluters and the ultra-rich must pay their fair share. We advocate for a permanent investment tool at the EU level to safeguard our social and climate priorities.\n\nThis robust adaptation framework and funding should target those who are most affected by climate change.\n\nOutdoor workers, for instance, who face dangerous weather conditions such as heatwaves, should not incur any financial risk and should be able to take part in decisions regarding adaptation policies at the workplace. According to the International Labour Organisation, the EU has seen a 42% increase in heat-related workplace fatalities since 2000.\n\nThe framework should also target workers employed in those sectors transitioning away from fossil fuels, such as the car or energy sector. Protective labour market policies together with reskilling initiatives to avert job losses are key to leaving no one behind.\n\nClimate change is not merely an environmental predicament -- it is a matter of social justice. Any claim to serve the people rings hollow if it ignores this existential crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, our transition to a sustainable future can only succeed if it is rooted in social justice, brings people hope for the future, and leaves no one behind - a Green Deal with a Red Heart.\n\nMEP Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez serves as President of the S&D Group, and MEP Mohammed Chahim is S&D Vice-President for the Green Deal.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iratxe_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iratxe Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Environment_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Environment Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Chahim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Chahim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Green_Deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Green Deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban heat island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Alliance_of_Socialists_and_Democrats", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/42/53/36/1200x675_cmsv2_52dcea9c-2b52-5531-83f8-522e9f878a22-8425336.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554314", "eventUri": "eng-9554314", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

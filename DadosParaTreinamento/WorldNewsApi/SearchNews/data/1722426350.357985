Niacinamide is said to work slowly, but right away, I noticed my skin tone looked better and more even. My face has large pores and rough skin. Since I've been using this, my skin doesn't appear as rough, it's smoother, and my pores are less visible. I can't say whether it reduces oily skin or prevents acne. But it didn't cause me acne or pimple breakouts. It seems to be doing what it claims it will. I look forward to seeing the full effects after more continued consistent use.\"\u2014Kim Price: $29.99", "summary": "<h1>For those who love to keep their skincare routine simple and clean.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/7/1/enhanced/378cd9a569e6/original-1525-1717722240-2.jpg?crop=2985:1990;0,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/chaelarwilliams99/target-skincare-products-that-are-easy-to-use\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/chaelarwilliams99/target-skincare-products-that-are-easy-to-use", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/7/3/campaign_images/706fc1ebfed5/if-you-love-a-short-skincare-routine-these-25-tar-3-466-1717730689-0_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:31:02", "author": "Chaela Williams,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "authors": ["Chaela Williams", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.319}

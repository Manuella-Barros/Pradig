The event spotlighted the collaborative efforts of the three companies in developing 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter engines.\n\nIn a joint statement, Toyota stated that the more compact engines will allow for lower hood heights compared to existing models, improving aerodynamics and design flexibility. The smaller engine packaging is also expected to contribute to better fuel efficiency.\n\nToyota's new 1.5-litre engine, for instance, will achieve a 10% reduction in both volume and weight compared to its current 1.5-litre engines used in models like the Yaris. Similarly, the 2.0-litre turbo engine will offer comparable improvements over the existing 2.4-litre turbo engines found in larger vehicles, such as three-row SUVs.\n\nThese engines are designed to be compatible with a variety of carbon-neutral fuels, including e-fuels, biofuels, and even liquid hydrogen. Reuters tells us that this compatibility is a crucial aspect of Toyota's strategy to decarbonize internal combustion engines and comply with increasingly strict emissions regulations, particularly in markets like the European Union. By 2030, the EU aims to implement \"Euro 7\" emissions standards, with a complete ban on new CO2-emitting cars set for 2035.\n\nToyota's Chief Technology Officer, Hiroki Nakajima, stressed the company's commitment to reducing the environmental impact of its vehicles. However, he did not specify when these new engines would be available in production models.\n\nRead Also: Tesla Is Being Investigated Over Bay Area Factory Toxic Emissions, Sued Over Alleged Health Harms\n\nThe move to develop these new engines is part of Toyota's broader \"multi-pathway\" approach to carbon neutrality. Despite the growing prominence of electric vehicles (EVs), Toyota has continued to invest in a range of powertrains.\n\n\"To provide our customers with diverse options to achieve carbon neutrality, we must evolve engines that are in tune with the future energy environment,\" Koji Sato, President and CEO of Toyota said in a statement.\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, Toyota sold approximately 2.4 million vehicles, with nearly 40% being petrol-electric hybrids. According to a previous Reuters report, Toyota sold only 104,000 battery EVs in 2023, accounting for less than 1% of total sales, including those from its luxury Lexus brand.\n\nToyota's strategy is driven by a belief that the global auto market will remain diverse in its energy needs. Chairman Akio Toyoda has previously stated that EVs might only capture a maximum of 30% of the global market, with hybrids, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, and fuel-burning vehicles making up the remainder.\n\nStay posted here at Tech Times.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_lopez@techtimes.com", "name": "John Lopez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_emission_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle emission standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-neutral_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-neutral fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Yaris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Yaris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuel efficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akio_Toyoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akio Toyoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/447741/820/0/0/0/toyota-motor-corp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603333", "eventUri": "eng-9603333", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Now, the trio is back with plans for a new generation of clean and efficient powertrains that supposedly can optimize performance and vehicle design while complying with increasingly strict emissions regulations.\n\nTo be clear, Toyota, Subaru and Mazda will not be using identical engines. Rather, they will share technologies as they develop signature engines that not only represent their respective brands but also cater to their customers' unique needs and preferences -- inline four-cylinders at Toyota, four-cylinder boxers at Subaru, and rotary engines at Mazda.\n\nToyota, which owns approximately 20 percent of Subaru and 5 percent of Mazda, has been particularly vocal these past few years about the dangers of going all-in on fully electric vehicles. The new engines will have a more compact design and be compatible with various carbon-neutral fuels like e-fuels, biofuels and liquid hydrogen. They will also be tailored to electrification to help with decarbonization of traditional engines.\n\nOn that note, look for a new generation of hybrid systems, such as the one Subaru will soon fit to the Forester and Crosstrek. Mazda is working on a rotary-EV system featuring one or two rotors and acting as a power generator.\n\nMeanwhile, Toyota showed a prototype of the Prius housing a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder engine that's currently under development, as well as a 2.0-litre variant.\n\n\"In order to provide our customers with diverse options to achieve carbon neutrality, it is necessary to take on the challenge of evolving engines that are in tune with the energy environment of the future,\" Toyota President and CEO Koji Sato said. \"The three companies, which share the same aspirations, will refine engine technologies through friendly competition.\"", "source": {"uri": "guideautoweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Guide de l'auto"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-neutral_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-neutral fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-four_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Straight-four engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotary engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Prius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i.gaw.to/content/photos/62/07/620757-toyota-subaru-et-mazda-vont-creer-des-moteurs-plus-propres-ensemble.jpg?1024x640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603333", "eventUri": "eng-9603333", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The new engines are \"tailored to electrification\" with integrated EV components.\n\nJapanese automakers have been some of the biggest laggards in the transition to fully electric. As a result, Toyota was once again the worst-ranked automaker on InfluenceMaps annual report on climate lobbying.\n\nThe rankings are based on automakers' EV plans and how much they are lobbying against climate-friendly government commitments.\n\nTesla, Ford, GM, VW, and Mercedes-Benz topped the list, while Toyota, Mazda, and Suzuki rounded out the bottom.\n\nDespite this, Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru are doubling down on ICE engines. In a press release Tuesday, the companies announced their commitment to developing new engines \"tailored to electrification and the pursuit of carbon neutrality.\"\n\nThe automakers aim to integrate EV components, including motors, batteries, and other electric drive units, into the new engines.\n\nMeanwhile, the new units are expected to be smaller and more compact to fit Toyota's new body styles for its next-gen EVs. Smaller engines enable lower hoods and improved aerodynamics for better performance and fuel efficiency.\n\nThe companies said they share a dedication to a \"multi-pathway approach\" to achieving carbon neutrality.\n\n\"In order to provide our customers with diverse options to achieve carbon neutrality, it is necessary to take on the challenge of evolving engines that are in tune with the energy environment of the future,\" Toyota's CEO Koji Sato said.\n\nSato explained that the three companies would \"refine engine technologies through friendly competition.\"\n\nThe approach includes e-fuel, biofuels, and liquid hydrogen. Toyota claims its new ICE engines will \"contribute to the broader adoption of CN fuels.\"\n\nThe companies said the new engines would be released in the future but didn't specify when they are expected to hit the market.\n\nEven though the global auto industry is shifting toward all-electric vehicles, Toyota and other Japanese rivals are looking to keep the engine alive.\n\nMeanwhile, Toyota's US boss, Ted Ogawa, believes the company is \"catching up\" on EVs and new tech. Of the over 2.2 million vehicles Toyota sold in the US last year, only 9,329 were fully electric, or less than 0.5%.\n\nMany automakers are already achieving double-digit or 100% EV sales at this point, but Toyota (and its Japanese counterparts) are still investing in ICE engines.\n\nThe trend can be seen globally. Toyota (including Lexus) sold 30,109 all-electric vehicles globally through March. That's only 1.2% of its over 2.4 million vehicles sold YTD.\n\nToyota has also promised next-gen EV batteries, but these are not due out until 2026 (or 2027) at the earliest.\n\nInvesting in ICE engines will likely lead to Toyota, Subaru, and Mazda falling further behind the pack as the market transitions to electric.\n\nWhat do you think about Toyota still investing in ICE engines?

They are expected to be used first in hybrid cars and then plug-in hybrids, according to one person familiar with the matter.\n\n\"This is in line with Toyota's strategy of spreading their bets across different technologies,\" said James Hong, auto analyst at Macquarie. Hong said Toyota was \"basically developing small-sized engines for hybrids ... that can be mounted without modifying the design of their next-generation vehicles\".\n\nVariants of the engines will be capable of running on diesel and petrol as well as on lower-emission or carbon-neutral fuels such as hydrogen or so-called e-fuel, This is part of a wider bet that alternative fuels made using electricity from renewable hydrogen and other gases will allow carmakers to keep selling combustion-engine vehicles that meet environmental regulations.\n\nMazda and Subaru, both part-owned by Toyota, also unveiled prototype engines on Tuesday. -

With these engines, each of the three companies will aim to optimize integration with motors, batteries, and other electric drive units. While transforming vehicle packaging with more compact engines, these efforts will also decarbonize ICEs by making them compatible with various carbon-neutral (CN) fuels1.\n\nSubaru, Toyota, and Mazda have always been driven by a deep understanding of their customers' diverse lifestyles. This understanding has led the three companies to develop signature engines2 that not only represent their respective brands but also cater to their customers' unique needs and preferences.\n\nIn pursuing decarbonization, all three companies have focused on carbon as the enemy and sought to expand options by acting with passion and purpose. This mindset has driven efforts to ensure a future for the supply chains and jobs that underpin engines. Under the extreme conditions of racing, the companies have worked to broaden powertrain and fuel options by competing with vehicles running on liquid hydrogen and CN fuels.\n\nThis process has clarified the role that future engines will play in achieving carbon neutrality. With the next generation of engines, the three companies will seek to not only improve standalone engine performance but also optimize their integration with electric drive units, harnessing the advantages of each.\n\nWhile being highly efficient and powerful, the new engines will also revolutionize vehicle packaging by being more compact than existing models. Smaller engines will allow for even lower hoods, improving design possibilities and aerodynamic performance while contributing to better fuel efficiency. The development will also emphasize compliance with increasingly strict emissions regulations.\n\nAt the same time, the new engines will be made carbon neutral by shifting away from fossil fuels and offering compatibility with various alternatives, including e-fuel (synthetic fuel), biofuels, and liquid hydrogen. In doing so, these engines will contribute to the broader adoption of CN fuels.\n\nUpon this announcement, the CEOs of the three companies made the following comments:\"Achieving a carbon-neutral society is a challenge that must be undertaken by all of Japan's industries and society as a whole. As we continue to refine electrification technology, we will also enhance our horizontally-opposed engines with an aim to use carbon-neutral fuels in the future. Moving forward, the three companies sharing the same aspiration will continue to advance the pursuit of sustainable excellence in Japanese car manufacturing.\"(Atsushi Osaki, Representative Director, President and CEO, Subaru Corporation)\n\n\"In order to provide our customers with diverse options to achieve carbon neutrality, it is necessary to take on the challenge of evolving engines that are in tune with the energy environment of the future. The three companies, which share the same aspirations, will refine engine technologies through friendly competition.\"(Koji Sato, President, Member of the Board of Directors and CEO, Toyota Motor Corporation)\n\n\"We will continue to offer customers exciting cars by honing internal combustion engines for the electrification era and expanding the multi-pathway possibilities for achieving carbon neutrality. Given the rotary engine's compatibility with electrification and carbon-neutral fuels, Mazda will continue to develop the technology through co-creation and competition to ensure it can contribute broadly to society.\"(Masahiro Moro, Representative Director, President and CEO, Mazda Motor Corporation)\n\nEven as Subaru, Toyota, and Mazda compete in the product arena with unique engines and cars, the companies have a shared dedication to achieving carbon neutrality through a multi-pathway approach. Together with like-minded partners similarly skilled and passionate about engines, they will work to create the future of Japan's auto industry.\n\n(1) Fuels with net zero CO2 emissions into the atmosphere across their lifecycle, from manufacture to use.

These pioneering engines are set to revolutionize vehicle packaging with more compact designs, optimizing integration with motors, batteries, and other electric drive units while decarbonizing internal combustion engines (ICEs) through compatibility with various carbon-neutral (CN) fuels.\n\nThe trio's deep understanding of their customers' diverse lifestyles has driven the development of these signature engines, which not only reflect each brand's identity but also cater to unique customer needs and preferences. With carbon neutrality as the ultimate goal, Subaru, Toyota, and Mazda are expanding powertrain and fuel options, particularly under the extreme conditions of racing, where vehicles running on liquid hydrogen and CN fuels are tested.\n\nThis innovative approach has clarified the pivotal role future engines will play in achieving carbon neutrality. The next generation of engines will not only enhance standalone performance but also seamlessly integrate with electric drive units, leveraging the strengths of each component. These engines will be highly efficient, powerful, and more compact, enabling improved design possibilities, better aerodynamic performance, and enhanced fuel efficiency. Additionally, they will adhere to increasingly stringent emissions regulations.\n\nA significant focus of this development is making these engines carbon-neutral by shifting away from fossil fuels and ensuring compatibility with e-fuel (synthetic fuel), biofuels, and liquid hydrogen. This transition will facilitate the broader adoption of CN fuels, marking a substantial step toward a sustainable future.\n\nThe CEOs of the three companies shared their perspectives on this groundbreaking initiative:\n\nAtsushi Osaki, Representative Director, President, and CEO, Subaru Corporation:\n\n\"Achieving a carbon-neutral society is a challenge that must be undertaken by all of Japan's industries and society as a whole. As we continue to refine electrification technology, we will also enhance our horizontally-opposed engines with the aim of using carbon-neutral fuels in the future. Moving forward, the three companies sharing the same aspiration will continue to advance the pursuit of sustainable excellence in Japanese car manufacturing.\"\n\nKoji Sato, President, Member of the Board of Directors, and CEO, Toyota Motor Corporation:\n\n\"In order to provide our customers with diverse options to achieve carbon neutrality, it is necessary to take on the challenge of evolving engines that are in tune with the energy environment of the future. The three companies, which share the same aspirations, will refine engine technologies through friendly competition.\"\n\nMasahiro Moro, Representative Director, President, and CEO, Mazda Motor Corporation:\n\n\"We will continue to offer customers exciting cars by honing internal combustion engines for the electrification era and expanding the multi-pathway possibilities for achieving carbon neutrality. Given the rotary engine's compatibility with electrification and carbon-neutral fuels, Mazda will continue to develop the technology through co-creation and competition to ensure it can contribute broadly to society.\"\n\nDespite their competition in the product arena, Subaru, Toyota, and Mazda are united in their dedication to achieving carbon neutrality through a multi-pathway approach.

They are expected to be used first in hybrid cars and then plug-in hybrids, according to one person familiar with the matter.\n\nVariants of the engines will be capable of running on diesel and petrol as well as on lower-emission or carbon-neutral fuels such as hydrogen or so-called e-fuel -- part of a wider bet that alternative fuels made using electricity from renewable hydrogen and other gases will allow carmakers to keep selling combustion-engine vehicles that meet environmental regulations.\n\nMazda and Subaru, both part-owned by Toyota, also unveiled prototype engines on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diesel fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-neutral_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-neutral fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akio_Toyoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akio Toyoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alternative fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 34}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F75edee47-8be9-4c68-b3c5-dcc070890b28.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603333", "eventUri": "eng-9603333", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Rather than pursuing a shared series of engines, each company will focus on its unique type of powertrain while sharing technologies. It's worth noting that Toyota owns about a fifth of Subaru and roughly 5% of Mazda.\n\nThis new generation of powertrains will be purposefully designed for electrification, featuring a more compact size and compatibility with a variety of carbon-neutral fuels, aligning with the path towards decarbonization.\n\nMore: Subaru Teams Up With Toyota For 3 New Electric SUVs By 2026\n\nThe joined \"multi-pathway approach\" from Japan takes place amidst a global EV slowdown, showing that ICE still has a future in the automotive world.\n\nEach company will develop its own type of engine\n\nSubaru, Toyota, and Mazda made it clear that they will remain competitors in the \"product arena\", offering \"unique engines and cars\". However, they all agreed that carbon is the enemy, and will collaborate on expanding the available options. In this context, each company will develop its \"signature\" powertrain - a boxer engine for Subaru, inline-fours for Toyota, and rotary engines for Mazda - catering the needs of their diverse customer bases.\n\nTargeting the decarbonization of ICE, the companies will optimize the integration of electric drive units on their respective powertrains, resulting in a new generation of hybrids. Carbon neutrality will also be achieved by shifting away from fossil fuels and focusing on alternatives solutions like e-fuel, biofuels, and liquid hydrogen, which are already being tested in racing.\n\nThe new combustion engines are described as \"highly efficient and powerful\", promising to offer improved performance. They will also be smaller in size, allowing future models to have lower hoods and better aerodynamics. Finally, engineers will make sure that the mills comply with the increasingly strict emission regulations in different markets around the world.\n\nThe official photos show a camouflaged prototype of the Crosstrek featuring Subaru's next-gen hybrid system. Toyota showed a Prius prototype with a new 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine currently under development, in addition to a larger displacement 2.0-liter unit. On the other hand, Mazda exhibited its rotary-EV system featuring one or two rotors, which act as power generators.\n\nStatements from the CEOs\n\nAtsushi Osaki, President and CEO of Subaru, said: \"Achieving a carbon-neutral society is a challenge that must be undertaken by all of Japan's industries and society as a whole. As we continue to refine electrification technology, we will also enhance our horizontally-opposed engines with an aim to use carbon-neutral fuels in the future. Moving forward, the three companies sharing the same aspiration will continue to advance the pursuit of sustainable excellence in Japanese car manufacturing.\"\n\nKoji Sato, President and CEO of Toyota added: \"In order to provide our customers with diverse options to achieve carbon neutrality, it is necessary to take on the challenge of evolving engines that are in tune with the energy environment of the future. The three companies, which share the same aspirations, will refine engine technologies through friendly competition.\"\n\nFinally, Masahiro Moro, President and CEO of Mazda stated: \"We will continue to offer customers exciting cars by honing internal combustion engines for the electrification era and expanding the multi-pathway possibilities for achieving carbon neutrality. Given the rotary engine's compatibility with electrification and carbon-neutral fuels, Mazda will continue to develop the technology through co-creation and competition to ensure it can contribute broadly to society.\"", "source": {"uri": "carscoops.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carscoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thanos_pappas@carscoops.com", "name": "Thanos Pappas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-neutral_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-neutral fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-four_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Straight-four engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotary engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flat engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Subaru-Toyota-Mazda-Collaboration.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603333", "eventUri": "eng-9603333", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

In a Tokyo presentation, Toyota emphasized its hybrid and zero-emission electric motor initiatives, aiming for carbon neutrality and addressing global and economic challenges.\n\n\"An engine reborn.\" That's how Japanese automaker Toyota introduced plans to cast a futuristic spin on the traditional internal combustion engine. During a three-hour presentation at a Tokyo hall Tuesday, the car manufacturer giant announced it would offer lean compact engines that also run on so-called green fuels like hydrogen and bioethanol, or get paired with zero-emissions electric motors in hybrids.\n\nThis comes as many competitors in the auto industry are pushing for fully electric vehicles. China is revving its push for Battery Electric Vehicles, and its own BYD is threatening to outshine Tesla in that push. Toyota's Chief Executive Koji Sato said the \"engine is optimised for the electrification era\" with hopes of helping push the world into \"carbon neutrality.\" Toyota already has a well-known hybrid car -- the Prius -- with a gas engine and an electric motor. It switches between the two to deliver a cleaner drive.\n\nIn future hybrids, the electric motor is set to become the main driving power, and the new engine will be designed to take a lesser role and help it along, according to Toyota.\n\nDomestic allies Subaru Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., both preparing ecological engines designed to meet the inevitably upcoming stringent emissions standards, joined Toyota 's presentation billed as a \"multi-pathway workshop.'' \"Each company wants to win, but we can be faster if we work together,\" said Sato. But details on when the engines were coming to market weren't disclosed. The legacy of the car engine could be felt everywhere. Mazda said that its prized rotary engine, introduced more than 50 years ago, was being adapted for electric vehicles.\n\nSubaru, meanwhile, showcased its trademark smaller horizontally opposed engine. While Chief Technology Officer Tetsuro Fujinuki confirmed the company was working on a great \"Subaru-like\" electric vehicle, he said the company wasn't about to dump the engine altogether.\n\nToyota, too, is working on stylish BEVs. The executives said Tuesday that energy supply conditions differed globally, adding that products had to meet various customer needs and the investments needed for mass-producing BEVS were enormous. Toyota officials also repeatedly noted that 5.5 million jobs were at stake in the overall supply chain for vehicle production in Japan nowadays, so a sudden shift to electric cars wasn't economically possible or socially responsible.\n\nTakahiro Fujimoto, a professor of business at Waseda University, believes electric vehicles are a key solution for reducing emissions.

But that argument is logically not the same as saying that all we need are BEVs,\" he said.\n\nUncertainties remain, spanning research and development, as well as social, political and market conditions, said Fujimoto.\n\n\"The carbon neutrality the world is aspiring toward isn't likely attainable for decades to come. It's going to be a long marathon race,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Transport Topics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The three Japanese automakers have announced a collaborative effort to develop a new family of engines that will aid in the push toward carbon neutrality.\n\nThe new engines, according to the joint announcement released today by all three automakers, will be \"tailored to electrification,\" which almost certainly means these will be the backbone of new hybrid systems that each automaker will seek to employ for upcoming products. Key to the new engine's eco-friendly goals will be the ability to run on various carbon-neutral (CN) fuels such as bio-fuels, synthetic fuels, and liquid hydrogen.\n\nToyota has been campaigning a hydrogen-powered race car in Japan for a while now, and no doubt the learnings from that program have helped inform this new family of engines that these automakers will be developing.\n\nInterestingly, these new engines won't all take the same form. The announcement mentioned that each automaker will leverage the development improvements to create signature engines that \"not only represent their respective brands but also cater to their customers' unique needs and preferences.\"\n\nEach automaker shared examples of what their signature engines would look like. Subaru brought a flat-four engine paired with a next-generation hybrid system stuffed inside a camouflaged prototype of its Crosstrek. (The hybrid Crosstrek is available in other markets -- albeit with an older version of the hybrid system. It's not currently available in North America.)\n\nMazda brought along single- and twin-rotor rotary engines. The company currently uses a rotary engine as a range-extender in the MX-30 and the Iconic SP sports car concept, though the engine has no mechanical connection to the wheels. Perhaps in the future, the rotary could once again spin the wheels directly.\n\nToyota displayed two new inline fours: A 1.5-liter unit, and a larger 2.0-liter unit. There wasn't much in the way of details for either, except that Toyota said that each motor \"achieves both high output and high thermal efficiency.\"\n\nIn addition to being more efficient and more powerful, the new engines will also be more compact in nature, helping to improve vehicle packaging. \"Smaller engines allow for even lower hoods, improving design possibilities and aerodynamic performance while contributing to better fuel efficiency,\" said the release. No arguments there. (Seeing a hood line come down instead of climbing would also be a welcome reversal of a somewhat annoying design trend, though we recognize part of that is driven by pedestrian safety laws.)\n\nThere's no word on a timetable for these engines, but we expect more details to trickle out -- including what cars will be the first recipients and the markets where these engines will be offered -- in the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "hagerty.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hagerty Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotary engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-four_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flat-four engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synthetic fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_MX-30", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mazda MX-30"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wankel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermal efficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mechanical_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mechanical Engineering", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://hagerty-media-prod.imgix.net/2024/05/Subaru-Toyota-Mazda-Multipathway-Workshop-38.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&ixlib=php-3.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603333", "eventUri": "eng-9603333", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The stated aim is \"decarbonization\" of its internal combustion engines, which is why this new trio is heading to market across all three brand's vehicle models.\n\nThe 1.5l and 2.0l engines, while optimised for alternative fuels, are also being made smaller and more compact. They're destined for hybrid vehicles and their reduced size will \"...allow for even lower hoods, improving design possibilities and aerodynamic performance while contributing to better fuel efficiency.\"\n\nSouth Africa has yet to lay hands on any of Toyota's more green-centric vehicles but the day isn't far off now. The recent presentation by the company and its partners -- Toyota owns part of both Mazda and Subaru -- is a glimpse at a future that is a little further away. The compact design is only part of the innovation. It's the intended fuel for these engines that makes them particularly noteworthy.\n\nBiofuel, which tends to be derived from plants, is one potential substance that will be used inside the Japanese company's new engines but there are two other alternatives planned. One is E-Fuel, which is exactly what it sounds like -- a synthetic gasoline made from hydrogen and CO2. The other is liquid hydrogen.\n\nHow each of these will be implemented isn't explained but there's also no stated date for when these new engines, which will be about 10% smaller than the engines used in Toyota compacts like the Yaris, will head to market in actual vehicles. There's plenty of time for the company to figure out how to explain that you should only use one type of fuel at a time. It's not like dumping liquid hydrogen, biofuel, and E-Fuel into the same tank will do your service plan any favours.

This will effectively decarbonize the engines without relying on battery technology.\n\nRather than fully converting its lineup to electric vehicles, Toyota is embracing a \"multi-pathway\" approach to reducing emissions, which includes continuing to invest in gasoline-powered cars. The world's largest automaker is also investing in EV technology, and last year made headlines with claims it will commercialize long-range, fast-charging solid-state batteries by 2027.\n\n\"We are serious about [developing] both battery EVs and internal combustion engines,\" Sato says, according to Nikkei Asia.\n\nToyota has been vocal about its hesitancy to convert its lineup to all EVs. That sets it apart from its Chinese, American, and European competitors, though it did not always appear as confident in its approach. The company removed its previous president, Akio Toyoda, in February 2023 after he publicly expressed resistance to an all-EV strategy. Sato replaced him and planned to accelerate EV efforts; it now appears the two are of a similar mindset.\n\nFor wider context, Japan is a surprising laggard in EV adoption despite being an automotive powerhouse. Fully battery-powered vehicles made up just 1.8% of new car sales in Japan in 2024, according to The Japan Times, compared to around 25% in China and 8% in the US.

The technological breakthrough could usher in a new era of bold Toyota designs, with low hoods, roomy cabins and airy greenhouses.\n\n\"We are close to achieving this kind of design with this kind of engine,\" Toyota Chief Technology Officer Hiroki Nakajima said in a sneak preview of the powertrain technology ahead of the official announcement Tuesday in Tokyo. \"The engines will completely differ from today's engines.\"\n\nToyota said the engines will arrive in the near future but didn't give a concrete timeline.\n\nThe world's biggest automaker described prototypes of the new powerplants at a Tuesday press conference in which it was joined by corporate allies Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.\n\nThe three Japanese carmakers are doubling down on next-generation internal combustion as a key technology for cutting carbon, even as the auto industry increasingly goes electric. By developing cleaner, more compact power plants that can run on carbon neutral fuels and combine with hybrid systems, Team Toyota wants to breathe new life into a century-old technology.\n\nThe smaller Japanese players, in which Toyota owns minority stakes, are developing their own plans for diversified approaches to carbon neutrality.\n\nMazda will work on improving its distinctive rotary engine to run on a range of carbon-neutral fuels. CEO Masahiro Moro set up dedicated engineering team this year to develop an eco-friendly rotary that generates electricity for a hybrid setup that burns renewable biofuel or hydrogen.\n\nMazda hinted at the technology in its Iconic SP concept at last year's Japan Mobility Show.\n\nSubaru will evolve its horizontally-opposed boxer engine to run with an electrified hybrid system. CEO Atsushi Osaki already plans to deploy a next-gen hybrid system to the Crosstrek and Forester crossovers, as a bridge to building a lineup of eight EV models by the end of 2028.\n\n\"Our shared recognition is that the enemy is carbon,\" Mazda Chief Technology Officer Ichiro Hirose said. \"The shift to EVs is going to be gradual. It's not going to happen very quickly. In the meantime, we need internal combustion that contributes to carbon neutrality.\"\n\nThe coordinated push, presented by the CEOs of the three companies in a rare joint press conference, reflects efforts by Japanese automakers to pursue a so-called multi-path approach to cutting carbon emissions. The idea was pioneered by Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda who insists that battery-electric cars are just one of many tools. Toyota, for its part, sees internal combustion of cleaner fuels also playing a role, alongside evolved hybrid drivetrains.\n\n\"We are still in the transition phase where we need engines as part of the solution,\" Nakajima said. \"This could be a game-changer solution. This new engine has lots of room to play.\"\n\nDown the road, next-gen engines could approach or achieve carbon neutrality by running on synthetic fuel, biofuel or, eventually, clean-burning hydrogen. Toyota has been developing hydrogen-burning engines for several years. Chairman Toyoda spent Memorial Day weekend driving a GR Corolla race car with a hydrogen engine in a 24-hour endurance race in Japan.\n\nToyoda has said new takes on the old tech will help win the war against carbon emissions while also saving jobs and preserving the smell, sound and feel that died-in-the-wool car fans crave.\n\nToyota's confidence in the future of internal combustion -- a technology that has underpinned the auto industry for more than a century -- comes as EV sales growth cools and international rivals rethink their plans for massive investment in battery factories and dedicated assembly lines.\n\nToyoda said in January that his company will \"promote engine development anew\" and is embarking on a new program that was given the green light by CEO Koji Sato.\n\nPairing Toyota's upcoming engines with next-generation hybrid systems could be an especially potent combination for the world's biggest seller of gasoline-electric drivetrains.\n\nBetter hybrids will not only take a bigger bite out of emissions, they could help stoke sales and profits that can be re-invested into electrification. In Toyota's just-ended fiscal year, the company soared to record revenue, sales, and profits on the back of surging sales of it trademark hybrids.\n\n\"The battery and engine combinations could be numerous,\" Nakajima said. \"In the past, the engine was always the star of the show. Now, it can be a supporting actor to the battery.\"\n\nThe new engines will be shorter and narrower than their existing counterparts. Smaller dimensions will help them fit into tomorrow's slimmed-down EV designs. The fresh looks are exemplified by the wedge-shaped Lexus LF-ZC and LF-ZC concepts.\n\nToyota is already working on a next-generation EV platform based on those concepts that it wants to put into a Lexus EV production model from 2026. The new silhouette could could do double duty, serving both next-gen EVs as well as vehicles loaded with these futuristic engines.\n\nToyota is rethinking its approach in order to use an EV platform as the starting point, and work backward, in a way, to re-engineer a new group of improved engines that fit into that EV framework. Toyota envisions mating the engines to a range of hybrid and plug-in hybrid layouts.\n\nAmong Toyota's new engines is a 1.5-liter engine that comes in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions. It is envisioned as a compact, performance power plant that delivers the same power as a traditional 2.5-liter naturally aspirated one. The non-turbo 1.5-liter engine is positioned as an eco-offering providing big fuel efficiency gains over today's 1.5-liter offerings.\n\nAlso on tap is a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine generating much higher power than today's standard 2.4-liter turbos, while delivering better fuel economy than both the 2.4-liter and 2.0-liter turbos already in Toyota's toolchest.\n\nDuring the sneak preview at Fuji Speedway, Toyota mounted the prototype 2.0 turbo in a pickup truck, sedan and sports car, to highlight its diverse applications. Short test rides in the sedan and pickup demonstrated impressive power and spunk.\n\nToyota needs these new engines to meet new emissions standards, especially as regulations tighten in coming years, Nakajima said. The breakthroughs, he said, came through improvements in thermal efficiency, a measure of how much of the engine's energy is transferred into turning the wheels as opposed to lost in heat through combustion.\n\n\"We won't have to give up performance while meeting future regulations,\" Nakajima said. \"These engines are better than any engine in the past. I think we are ready to fly now.\"", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_greimel@autonews.com", "name": "Hans Greimel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rotary engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akio_Toyoda", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akio Toyoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flat engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_body_style", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car body style"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lexus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_GR_Corolla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toyota GR Corolla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e3o_Paulo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuji_Speedway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuji Speedway"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/1024x512/public/TOYODA-MAIN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603333", "eventUri": "eng-9603333", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

China is revving its push for Battery Electric Vehicles, and its own BYD is threatening to outshine Tesla in that push.\n\nToyota's Chief Executive Koji Sato said the \"engine is optimized for the electrification era\" with hopes of helping push the world into \"carbon neutrality.\"\n\nToyota already has a well-known hybrid car -- the Prius -- with a gas engine and an electric motor. It switches between the two to deliver a cleaner drive.\n\nIn future hybrids, the electric motor is set to become the main driving power, and the new engine will be designed to take a lesser role and help it along, according to Toyota.\n\nDomestic allies Subaru Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., both preparing ecological engines designed to meet the inevitably upcoming stringent emissions standards, joined Toyota 's presentation billed as a \"multi-pathway workshop.\"\n\n\"Each company wants to win, but we can be faster if we work together,\" said Sato.\n\nBut details on when the engines were coming to market weren't disclosed.\n\nThe legacy of the car engine could be felt everywhere.\n\nMazda said that its prized rotary engine, introduced more than 50 years ago, was being adapted for electric vehicles.\n\nSubaru, meanwhile, showcased its trademark smaller horizontally opposed engine. While Chief Technology Officer Tetsuro Fujinuki confirmed the company was working on a great \"Subaru-like\" electric vehicle, he said the company wasn't about to dump the engine altogether.\n\nToyota, too, is working on stylish BEVs.\n\nThe executives said Tuesday that energy supply conditions differed globally, adding that products had to meet various customer needs and the investments needed for mass-producing BEVS were enormous.\n\nToyota officials also repeatedly noted that 5.5 million jobs were at stake in the overall supply chain for vehicle production in Japan nowadays, so a sudden shift to electric cars wasn't economically possible or socially responsible.\n\nTakahiro Fujimoto, a professor of business at Waseda University, believes electric vehicles are a key solution for reducing emissions. But they still have weak points, such as large amounts of emissions produced while making lithium-ion batteries, a chief component.\n\nIn Japan, for instance, commuters use trains, so that may be a better ecological choice for transportation, Fujimoto said.\n\n\"At the very least, I believe the proliferation of and innovations in BEVs are definitely needed. But that argument is logically not the same as saying that all we need are BEVs,\" he said.\n\nUncertainties remain, spanning research and development, as well as social, political and market conditions, said Fujimoto.\n\n\"The carbon neutrality the world is aspiring toward isn't likely attainable for decades to come. It's going to be a long marathon race,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nYuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

Specifically, Toyota is preparing new inline-fours, Mazda is pursuing rotary engines, and Subaru aims to improve the horizontally opposed boxer. The new powertrains will be compatible with several carbon-neutral fuels: liquid hydrogen, biofuel, and synthetic fuel.\n\nAlong with the announcement, there were some samples of future engines. Mazda brought single- and dual-rotor engines for EV applications. As seen in the MX-30 and the Iconic SP sports car concept, the rotary engine serves as a generator to juice up the battery. It doesn't have a mechanical connection to the wheels. Mazda does say the rotary is \"currently used for generators,\" which some might interpret as a sign that this could change in the future.\n\nToyota displayed a pair of work-in-progress inline-fours, a 1.5-liter unit it showcased separately and also inside a prototype, plus a bigger 2.0-liter engine. The company didn't have much to say about them, aside from mentioning both have a \"high output and high thermal efficiency.\"\n\nAs for Subaru, it brought a next-generation hybrid system and put it inside a camouflaged Crosstrek prototype as well. The third-generation model currently sold in the United lacks a hybrid option but the crossover does come with an electrified setup in other markets. It combines a 2.0-liter boxer engine with a 12.3-kilowatt electric motor and a small lithium-ion battery pack.\n\nToyota, Mazda, and Subaru made it crystal clear they'll remain rivals despite joining forces to develop more frugal powertrains. Because these new engines will be smaller, the trio says future models are going to have lower hoods for better aero to further improve efficiency. At the same time, these changes will give designers more freedom.\n\nAnother common goal the three brands have is to integrate motors, batteries, and other electric drive units into these next-gen ICEs. The combustion engines are set to deliver better performance, so let's hope fun cars will benefit from these new developments.", "source": {"uri": "motor1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor1.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-neutral_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-neutral fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rotary engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-four_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Straight-four engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flat engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_MX-30", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mazda MX-30"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synthetic fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (automobile)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mechanical_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mechanical Engineering", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/Vze0vG/s3/toyota-subaru-mazda-engines.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603333", "eventUri": "eng-9603333", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

China is revving its push for Battery Electric Vehicles, and its own BYD is threatening to outshine Tesla in that push.\n\nToyota's Chief Executive Koji Sato said the \"engine is optimized for the electrification era\" with hopes of helping push the world into \"carbon neutrality.\"\n\nToyota already has a well-known hybrid car -- the Prius -- with a gas engine and an electric motor. It switches between the two to deliver a cleaner drive.\n\nIn future hybrids, the electric motor is set to become the main driving power, and the new engine will be designed to take a lesser role and help it along, according to Toyota.\n\nDomestic allies Subaru Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., both preparing ecological engines designed to meet the inevitably upcoming stringent emissions standards, joined Toyota 's presentation billed as a \"multi-pathway workshop.\"\n\n\"Each company wants to win, but we can be faster if we work together,\" said Sato.\n\nBut details on when the engines were coming to market weren't disclosed.\n\nThe legacy of the car engine could be felt everywhere.\n\nMazda said that its prized rotary engine, introduced more than 50 years ago, was being adapted for electric vehicles.\n\nSubaru, meanwhile, showcased its trademark smaller horizontally opposed engine. While Chief Technology Officer Tetsuro Fujinuki confirmed the company was working on a great \"Subaru-like\" electric vehicle, he said the company wasn't about to dump the engine altogether.\n\nToyota, too, is working on stylish BEVs.\n\nThe executives said Tuesday that energy supply conditions differed globally, adding that products had to meet various customer needs and the investments needed for mass-producing BEVS were enormous.\n\nToyota officials also repeatedly noted that 5.5 million jobs were at stake in the overall supply chain for vehicle production in Japan nowadays, so a sudden shift to electric cars wasn't economically possible or socially responsible.\n\nTakahiro Fujimoto, a professor of business at Waseda University, believes electric vehicles are a key solution for reducing emissions. But they still have weak points, such as large amounts of emissions produced while making lithium-ion batteries, a chief component.\n\nIn Japan, for instance, commuters use trains, so that may be a better ecological choice for transportation, Fujimoto said.\n\n\"At the very least, I believe the proliferation of and innovations in BEVs are definitely needed. But that argument is logically not the same as saying that all we need are BEVs,\" he said.\n\nUncertainties remain, spanning research and development, as well as social, political and market conditions, said Fujimoto.\n\n\"The carbon neutrality the world is aspiring toward isn't likely attainable for decades to come.

This will effectively decarbonize the engines without relying on battery technology.\n\nRather than fully converting its lineup to electric vehicles, Toyota is embracing a \"multi-pathway\" approach to reducing emissions, which includes continuing to invest in gasoline-powered cars. The world's largest automaker is also investing in EV technology, and last year made headlines with claims it will commercialize long-range, fast-charging solid-state batteries by 2027.\n\n\"We are serious about [developing] both battery EVs and internal combustion engines,\" Sato says, according to Nikkei Asia.\n\nToyota has been vocal about its hesitancy to convert its lineup to all EVs. That sets it apart from its Chinese, American, and European competitors, though it did not always appear as confident in its approach. The company removed its previous president, Akio Toyoda, in February 2023 after he publicly expressed resistance to an all-EV strategy. Sato replaced him and planned to accelerate EV efforts; it now appears the two are of a similar mindset.\n\nFor wider context, Japan is a surprising laggard in EV adoption despite being an automotive powerhouse. Fully battery-powered vehicles made up just 1.8% of new car sales in Japan in 2024, according to The Japan Times, compared to around 25% in China and 8% in the US. However, 55% of new cars sold in Japan are hybrids, TrendData reports.\n\n\"It is important to consider the future of energy and come up with diverse options to ensure reductions in CO2 emissions,\" says Sato.", "source": {"uri": "pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_dreibelbis@pcmag.com", "name": "Emily Dreibelbis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrol_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petrol engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-neutral_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-neutral fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Japan_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Japan Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akio_Toyoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akio Toyoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/00DEL8CmyGv2rtxalv5HKYg-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1716908385.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603333", "eventUri": "eng-9603333", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

(Kyodo News via AP)\n\nThat's how Japanese automaker Toyota introduced plans to cast a futuristic spin on the traditional internal combustion engine.\n\nDuring a three-hour presentation at a Tokyo hall Tuesday, the car manufacturer giant announced it would offer lean compact engines that also run on so-called green fuels like hydrogen and bioethanol, or get paired with zero-emissions electric motors in hybrids.\n\nThis comes as many competitors in the auto industry are pushing for fully electric vehicles. China is revving its push for Battery Electric Vehicles, and its own BYD is threatening to outshine Tesla in that push.\n\nToyota's Chief Executive Koji Sato said the \"engine is optimized for the electrification era\" with hopes of helping push the world into \"carbon neutrality.\"\n\nToyota already has a well-known hybrid car -- the Prius -- with a gas engine and an electric motor.

Now it's trying to repeat the trick with an unlikely bet on the combustion engine", "body": "While many automakers predicted a looming all-EV future, Toyota made gains by emphasizing hybrids over fully electric vehicles -- a move that earned it derision before being vindicated over the past year as EV sales sputtered. Now it's now doubling down with a new take on the traditional car engine.\n\nThe world's largest carmaker said Tuesday that it would develop smaller internal combustion engines that are more optimized for hybrid vehicles and can accept alternative fuels such as biofuels, liquid hydrogen, and synthetic e-fuels in an effort to cut down on emissions. The CEOs of Subaru and Mazda also vowed to produce new engines, they said in a press conference with Toyota CEO Koji Sato Tuesday.\n\nThe new engines, although still mostly gas-powered, will allow for more compact and efficient vehicles that get better gas mileage as part of a decarbonization effort that treats \"carbon as the enemy,\" according to a Tuesday press release.\n\nSato said that, while the auto industry is focused on battery-powered vehicles, there is still room for improved combustion engines.\n\n\"In order to provide our customers with diverse options to achieve carbon neutrality, it is necessary to take on the challenge of evolving engines that are in tune with the energy environment of the future,\" he said in a Tuesday statement.\n\nToyota's move is an extension of the company's so-called \"multi-pathway\" approach, which includes offering consumers a variety of options to reduce their vehicle emissions, including hybrids as well as electric vehicles. For years, former Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was hesitant on EVs and pushed to diversify its offerings.\n\nAfter EV sales nearly doubled from 2020 to 2021, then-CEO Toyoda cautioned that a fully electric future for the car industry was, \"going to take longer than the media would like us to believe.\" In January, Toyoda, now the automaker's chairman, went further, saying that EV adoption would peak at 30% of all car sales.\n\nToyoda's unpopular stance prompted criticism from investors, analysts, and environmentalists, who said the company was wrong to bet against the inevitability of an all-EV future. Amid the pressure, Toyoda stepped down as CEO to become chairman.\n\nAfter all that, the all-electric future has been a long time coming. Some traditional automakers including Ford have had to pull back on their ambitious EV plans. U.S. EV giant Tesla has also quietly lowered its sales targets, following CEO Elon Musk's warning in January of \"notably lower\" sales growth this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Toyota's diversification has been slowly vindicated as global EV sales have stagnated and customers turn to hybrids as an alternative. In February, the company raised its net profit guidance to a record $30.3 billion, fueled in part by strong hybrid sales.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akio_Toyoda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akio Toyoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alternative fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhaust gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuel efficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2154468985-e1716924579135.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603333", "eventUri": "eng-9603333", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

They also \"aim to optimize integration with motors, batteries, and other electric drive units\" for hybrid powertrains. Subaru showed a camouflaged Crosstrek Hybrid prototype at the presentation.\n\nThe three automakers will also continue exploring alternatives to conventional fossil fuels, including synthetic fuels, biofuels, and liquid hydrogen. This follows another joint development effort announced in 2021, in which Subaru and Toyota announced plans to test BRZ and GR86 sports cars, respectively, run on synthetic fuel, while Mazda contributed a biodiesel-fueled Demio hatchback.\n\nToyota in 2021, also debuted a Corolla race car that burned hydrogen in its combustion engine. The car was campaigned in the Japanese Super Taikyu Series that year, reviving an idea that was previously put into practice in 2006, when BMW presented a 7-Series prototype with a hydrogen-powered V-12 engine.\n\nOther automakers have also shown interest in synthetic fuel, also known as e-fuel, which aims to achieve carbon neutrality by absorbing carbon from the atmosphere in its production process, cancelling out any emissions from burning the fuel.

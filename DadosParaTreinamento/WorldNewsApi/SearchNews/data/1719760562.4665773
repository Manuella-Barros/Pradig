{"id": 225012476, "title": "Court to decide on Auditor General\u2019s dismissal case on June 5", "text": "The Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus will announce its decision on June 5 regarding a preliminary objection raised by Auditor General Odysseas Michaelides in his dismissal case. Attorney General George Savvidis had requested Michaelides\u2019 removal from office due to alleged \u201cinappropriate behaviour.\u201d Arguments clash During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, lawyers for both sides presented contrasting arguments. Joe Triantafyllides, representing the Auditor General, argued that the Attorney General lacks the legal authority to initiate dismissal proceedings. He stated that the Constitution does not explicitly state who has the right to file a dismissal request. He also argued that there is no gap in the Constitution, even if it may be silent on this matter. Triantafyllides further argued that the Attorney General cannot invoke public interest to seek dismissal under Article 113 of the Constitution, which he said applies only to criminal cases. \u201cThe applicant justifies his standing to file the application for dismissal as a defender of the public interest under Article 113 of the Constitution,\u201d Triantafyllides said, characterising this interpretation as \u201cpatently erroneous.\u201d \u201cArticle 113 (2) concerns only criminal offences, and its scope cannot be extended.\u201d Giorgos Valiantis, representing the Attorney General, countered these arguments. He pointed to existing case law as establishing the Attorney General\u2019s authority. \u201cThe Tryphonos and Erotokritou cases have clearly set out all the issues,\u201d Valiantis said. He stressed that these cases recognise the Attorney General\u2019s broad powers under Articles 112 and 113 of the Constitution, and the right to request the dismissal of officials such as the Assistant Attorney General. Valiantis further argued that the President\u2019s approval is not required for the Attorney General to act. The President of the Republic\u2019s consent is not required for the Attorney General\u2019s standing to file a dismissal request, Valiantis stated. Court decision and next steps The Court President, Antonis Liatsos, announced that the Court\u2019s decision on the preliminary objection will be delivered on June 5 at 9:30 a.m. Read more", "summary": "The Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus will announce its decision on June 5 regarding a preliminary objection raised by Auditor General Odysseas Michaelides in his dismissal case.

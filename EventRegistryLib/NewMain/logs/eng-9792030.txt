Joc Pederson clubbed a go-ahead three-run homer in the seventh for the Diamondbacks, who have gone 15-5 since July 10 to make themselves a serious wild-card contender.\n\n\"It shows what we have in (this) group,\" Pederson, who is batting .381 with four homers and 10 RBIs in his past eight games, told the Diamondbacks' broadcast.\n\n\"It was a good series win and we've got to take that (momentum) into another good team in Cleveland.\"\n\nGallen (9-5, 3.56 ERA), meanwhile, went 0-1 with a 9.00 ERA in his first three starts of July. But, out of the All-Star break, he owns a 2.12 ERA while winning all three starts. The right-hander gave up one run and six hits while walking one batter and striking out six over six innings of the Diamondbacks' 5-4 victory against Washington on Wednesday.\n\n\"I felt like I had everything working, which has been a long time coming,\" Gallen said after his most recent outing.\n\n\"I felt like I was in control from pitch one to 90. I'll take it.\"\n\nGallen is 2-0 with a 2.84 ERA in two starts versus Cleveland, which came in 2022 and 2023. In the Diamondbacks' 5-1 home victory over the Guardians on June 16, 2023, Gallen allowed six hits, including a homer to Jose Ramirez, and fanned seven without a walk in seven innings.\n\nRamirez is batting .391 with five homers and 11 RBIs in his past six games. He had two hits Sunday, but Cleveland dropped its second straight, 9-5 to Baltimore and split that four-game home set among AL pennant contenders.\n\nThe Guardians had won five straight and eight of 10 prior to those back-to-back defeats.\n\nWith Cleveland's Tanner Bibee bothered by a shoulder issue and recently acquired Alex Cobb apparently still not ready to make his 2024 debut, Logan Allen (8-4, 5.67) will return to the majors to start this series opener.\n\nAllen ranks third on the team in victories, but recorded just five quality starts while allowing 18 homers and 35 walks in the 18 starts he made before being sent down to Triple-A Columbus on July 7.\n\nThe left-hander allowed 11 runs and 18 hits in 11 2/3 innings while going 0-1 during his last three major league starts. Allen was 2-0 with a 3.86 ERA and 12 strikeouts in three starts since his demotion to Columbus.\n\n\"It was tough,\" Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said of Allen being sent down to Triple-A. \"Logan is such a big part of our success.\"\n\nAllen, who turns 26 in September, has never faced the Diamondbacks. However, Arizona's Josh Bell, a former Guardian, has homered against him.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gambling is not offered on this website in any form.\n\nIt's time to continue our MLB odds series with a Diamondbacks-Guardians prediction and pick. Find out how to watch Diamondbacks Guardians.\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians just split a four-game series with the Baltimore Orioles in a possible preview of the American League Championship Series. The Guardians went toe to toe with a strong, accomplished American League opponent and held their ground. There is no reason for Cleveland to walk away from that series thinking it can't beat Baltimore with a spot in the World Series on the line. The Guardians now need to make sure they maintain their lead in the American League Central and do not let the Minnesota Twins or Kansas City Royals make a strong challenge for the division title in the next two months. Cleveland has done so well to get to this point, but there are still roughly 50 games left in the season, nearly one-third of the 162-game schedule. Cleveland is roughly 70 percent to its goal, but the remaining 30 percent cannot be taken for granted. It's time for Cleveland to find a finishing kick.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks are alive and kicking. They are surging up the standings and have discovered their offense, which was AWOL for most of the first two and a half months of the season. Corbin Carroll has hit better, and Joc Pederson has smashed a number of very big home runs this season, including Sunday's big blast to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, but the real story behind Arizona's summer surge is Ketel Marte. He hit his 27th homer of the season on Sunday against the Bucs. He is swatting the ball left and right and is carrying the Diamondbacks' offense. He is playing at a superstar level, and if he keeps it up, it's going to be hard to see how the D-Backs won't return to October to defend their National League pennant.\n\nZac Gallen (9-5) has a 3.56 ERA. He isn't quite at the level he established in previous seasons, when he made a strong run at the Cy Young Award, but Gallen is still a very good pitcher who knows how to pitch with men on base and get himself out of trouble. Last week was representative of a good (not great) Gallen start. He scattered six hits in six innings but allowed only one run. He pitched really well in the important moments. He needs to continue to do that, and the Guardians will pose a significant challenge. Passing this test would show that Gallen is ready for the stretch run and the bigger games awaiting Arizona.\n\nLast Start: Wednesday, July 31 versus the Washington Nationals: 6 IP, 6 H, 1 R, 0 HR, 1 BB, 6 K\n\n2024 Road Splits: 8 starts, 36 IP, 33 H, 16 R, 5 HR, 16 BB, 37 K\n\nLogan Allen (8-4) has a 5.67 ERA. He has benefited a lot from Cleveland's thriving offense. As you can see below, he hasn't pitched in four weeks. Cleveland needs Allen to eat up innings and keep the team competitive. He doesn't need to be a hero. He just needs to provide good length and minimize damage.\n\nLast Start: July 6 versus the San Francisco Giants: 4 1/3 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 0 HR, 4 BB, 9 K\n\nTV: MLB (Diamondbacks) / Bally Sports Great Lakes (Guardians) / MLB Extra Innings\n\nZac Gallen is a much better pitcher than Logan Allen. It's that simple. Ketel Marte being on a heater also helps Arizona's chances in this game.\n\nWhy The Guardians Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Guardians just lost two home games to the Orioles. They are in a very good bounce-back spot here and can get to Zac Gallen, who allows plenty of baserunners.\n\nFinal Diamondbacks-Guardians Prediction & Pick\n\nThe pitching matchup gives Arizona the advantage, but the Guardians are the better team. You can -- and should -- pass on this game.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors":

There were four lead changes and five ties in the wild, interleague matchup.\n\n\"I was like a proud dad because I watched the entire team rally around each other to get this one,\" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. \"We were exhausted, but I wanted to hug everyone because it was a great win.\"\n\nJoc Pederson belted a two-run homer in the eighth -- the sixth pinch-hit shot of his career -- off Scott Barlow to put Arizona in front 6-5.\n\nThe Diamondbacks moved within a percentage point of the top National League wild-card spot and won for the 22nd time in 31 games since June 29.\n\n\"There is no give up in this team in all aspects, whether we're down in the first inning or in the eighth or ninth,\" Pederson said. \"We just kind of pass the baton to the next guy. It's a real good feeling when you're making it happen.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez had three hits, two runs, two stolen bases and an RBI for the Guardians, who have the best record in the majors at 67-45. They also own the top home mark in baseball at 35-18.\n\nKetel Marte and Gabriel Moreno had back-to-back homers off Logan Allen to start the game, which was the third time in franchise history that Arizona has done so. Gold Glove catcher Moreno later exited with a left groin strain and is headed to the injured list.\n\n\"I was going at high intensity and felt a tight pull halfway down the line (on an infield single),\" Moreno said through an interpreter. \"I don't know how long it's going to take because this is the first time I've had this kind of injury.\"\n\nThompson (6-3) allowed one run in one inning for the victory, while Justin Martinez picked up his first save of the season. Clase (4-2) had his eight-inning scoreless streak end with the unearned run.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez also had three hits and drove in two runs, and Steven Kwan and Naylor had two hits apiece for Cleveland. The Guardians used eight pitchers, including Allen, who allowed two runs in five innings.\n\nAllen was struck on the head by Randal Grichuk's line drive in the first, but the left-hander retired the final 10 batters he faced after being recalled from Triple-A Columbus earlier in the day.\n\n\"I'd rather be up here, even if it's taking balls off the head and giving up homers,\" Allen deadpanned. \"Giving the team a chance to win is all I'm trying to do.\"\n\nGuardians: RHP Tanner Bibee (right shoulder tightness) remains on the active roster, despite not pitching since July 29. The staff ace was slated to play catch before the game, and manager Stephen Vogt said his next start will be determined after the session.\n\nGuardians RHP Ben Lively (10-6, 3.43 ERA) pitches the middle game of the three-game series against Diamondbacks LHP Eduardo Rodriguez, who has been on the IL since March 25 with a left shoulder strain.", "source": {"uri": "wkyc.com", "dataType": "news",

Lane Thomas made a great sliding catch, but it was hit deep enough to score Corbin Carroll and give Arizona a 7-6 lead heading to the bottom of the 10th.\n\nGuardians-Diamondbacks headed to extra innings\n\nThere will be free baseball at Progressive Field.\n\nEmmanuel Clase will be entering the game for the Guardians.\n\nGuardians vs. Diamondbacks score: Daniel Schneemann ties it in the ninth\n\nDaniel Schneemann wasn't too far from a walk-off home run, but his drive to center field ran out of steam on the warning track. Still, it was easily enough to score Naylor from third base, and the Guardians and Diamondbacks are tied 6-6 in the ninth inning.\n\nBo Naylor triples off the wall; Guardians having tying run on third in ninth inning\n\nBo Naylor narrowly missed a game-tying home run, but he was able to make it into a triple, as the Diamondbacks didn't play the bounce off the wall as well as they would have liked.\n\nThat'll put the potential tying run 90 feet away from home with Daniel Schneemann coming on as a pinch-hitter and one out. After Schneemann, the Guardians will have Steven Kwan and the top of the lineup up.\n\nDiamondbacks vs. Guardians: Zac Gallen's day is done\n\nThe Diamondbacks are going to the bullpen in the eighth inning.\n\nGallen has been pulled after seven innings and five earned runs on eight hits and two walks with four strikeouts.\n\nJoc Pederson hits go-ahead home run\n\nJoc Pederson has put on a show at Progressive Field before, and he did so again tonight, crushing a Scott Barlow offering over the wall in right field for a two-run home run that has given the Diamondbacks a 6-5 lead in the eighth inning.\n\nAndres Gimenez two-run single off Zac Gallen gives Guardians the lead\n\nFor the second time tonight, the Guardians have answered a two-run inning from Arizona with a two-run inning of their own.\n\nThis time, it was Andres Gimenez, who grounded a single back up the middle to score Jose Ramirez (who was on third base after he caught the Diamondbacks sleeping twice and stole two bases) and Josh Naylor (who also got himself into scoring position with a stolen base).\n\nThe Guardians have a 5-4 lead entering the seventh inning.\n\nDiamondbacks retake lead against Cade Smith\n\nCade Smith has been absolutely terrific for the Guardians this season, but he's had a rare hiccup tonight.\n\nAgainst Smith, the Diamondbacks have come back to take a 4-3 lead with a two-run sixth inning.\n\nEugenio Suarez doubled home a run, and Geraldo Perdomo beat out a potential double-play to make it a 4-3 score.\n\nLogan Allen retires 10 consecutive batters\n\nAfter Logan Allen's nightmarish first inning, in which he allowed two home runs, four hits in total and two walks, Allen has allowed just one hit over his last four innings, and he's now retired 10 consecutive hitters as the Guardians hold their one-run lead over the Diamondbacks, 3-2, in the fifth.\n\nGabriel Moreno injury update\n\nDiamondbacks Gabriel Moreno left tonight's game with a strained left groin, according to a press box announcement.\n\nWho's winning the Guardians-Diamondbacks game? Bo Naylor RBI gives Cleveland the lead\n\nLogan Allen gave up two home runs in his first five pitches, and he's been hit by two comebackers since, but he also now has the Guardians out in front thanks to Bo Naylor's RBI single back up the middle in the second inning that has made it a 3-2 score.\n\nGabriel Moreno injury; Diamondbacks catcher leaves game after apparent leg injury\n\nIn the second inning, Gabriel Moreno hit a ball off Logan Allen's leg, and during the race to first base, Moreno came up hobbling with an apparent leg injury. He was down for several moments and limped off the field.\n\nMoreno is leaving the game.\n\nAllen, who has now been hit in the head and the leg with comebackers tonight, appears to be fine.\n\nGuardians tie it with two-run first inning; Jose Ramirez hits RBI double off Zac Gallen\n\nThe Guardians quickly erased the Diamondbacks' two run lead with a two-run first inning of their own.\n\nWith Lane Thomas on first base, Jose Ramirez ripped a double into the right-center gap that made it 1-0. Ramirez ended up on third due to the throw home, and he then scored via a Josh Naylor groundout to tie it.\n\nLogan Allen hit in the head with a comebacker off the bat of Randal Grichuk\n\nThis has been a nightmare first inning for Allen. After the back-to-back homers to open the game, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. followed with a single to center field.\n\nA few batters later, after Josh Bell grounded into a double play, Randal Grichuck lined a ball right back to the mound that hit Allen on the left side of his head.\n\nReplays indicate Allen was able to get a piece of the ball with his hand, but it still hit him in the head and bounced toward center field. Allen was checked on my the team's medical staff and appears to be OK. He's remaining in the game after the scary moment.\n\nGabriel Moreno hits home run; Diamondbacks begin game with back-to-back homers\n\nFive pitches, two home runs.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have gone back-to-back to open tonight's game, with Ketel Marte and Gabriel Moreno drilling solo home runs.\n\nAllen's return is off to a rough start.\n\nDiamondbacks, Guardians score: Ketel Marte hits first pitch of the game for a leadoff home run\n\nOne pitch, one home run.\n\nLogan Allen returned from Triple-A to start tonight's game, and his very first pitch was crushed by Ketel Marte for a leadoff home run.\n\nCC Sabathia is now in the Guardians' Hall-of-Fame, and he offered a two-part message to Cleveland fans.\n\nJose Ramirez passes Albert Belle for second place on Guardians all-time home run ranks\n\nJose Ramirez made history this week by taking sole possession of second place on Cleveland's franchise home run list -- and he passed some serious names in Cleveland baseball history along the way.\n\nThe Guardians addressed their pitching depth issues by dealing for right-hander Alex Cobb from the San Francisco Giants.\n\nGuardians clubhouse reacts to Lane Thomas trade\n\nThe Guardians were thrilled (and in a way, relieved) to see Lane Thomas added to the roster.\n\nJackson grad Dillon Dingler makes MLB debut against Guardians\n\nJackson High School graduate Dillon Dingler made his major league debut Monday, and he got his big moment in the seventh inning.\n\nGuardians No. 1 overall draft pick Travis Bazzana meets Jose Ramirez, wants to grow the game in Australia\n\nIt all finally sank in for Travis Bazzana, the top overall draft pick in the draft, when he stepped onto the field at Progressive Field and met Jose Ramirez and others.\n\n2024 National Sports Card Convention comes to Cleveland\n\nThe National Sports Card Convention was in Cleveland recently. We broke down how we'd spend $100, ranked the most mind-blowing items we could find and listed the top collectibles for under $50.\n\nHow can I watch, listen or stream the Cleveland Guardians game today?\n\nThe game will be televised on Bally Sports. It'll be broadcast on the radio by WTAM (1100-AM) and WMMS (100.7-FM).\n\nNext game on Guardians schedule\n\nThe Guardians have a seven-game homestand against the Baltimore Orioles and Arizona Diamondbacks. They'll then head to Minnesota to play four games (including a double-header).", "source": {"uri": "marionstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Marion Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

However, the Guardians answered in the ninth when Bo Naylor drove a pitch from Ryan Thompson (6-3) off the 19-foot-high wall in left-center field that went for a triple. Daniel Schneeman's sacrifice fly tied the contest.\n\nSuarez, though, delivered a one-out sacrifice fly off Emmanuel Clase (4-2) and Justin Martinez stranded a pair of runners in the ninth for Arizona, which has won 10 of 12 and is 22-9 since June 29. Ketel Marte and Gabriel Moreno opened the game with back-to-back homers for the Diamondbacks.\n\nJose Ramirez and Andres Gimenez each had three hits for the AL Central-leading Guardians, who have lost three straight.\n\nMarte sent the first pitch of the game over that wall in left against Logan Allen, who was recalled from Triple-A Columbus for his first start since July 6. Four pitches later, Moreno also went deep.\n\nThe Guardians picked up Allen, who took batted balls to the head and leg on the night, in their half of the first. Arizona ace Zac Gallen yielded an RBI double to Ramirez, who scored on Josh Naylor's groundout to tie it at 2-2.\n\nCleveland went ahead in the second. Gimenez led off with a double and scored when Bo Naylor laced a single into center.\n\nAllen allowed just those two runs in five innings. Then Cade Smith took over in the sixth and yielded two. Suarez roped a one-out, RBI double into the left-field corner. The Diamondbacks then went ahead on Geraldo Perdomo's RBI groundout.\n\nHowever, Cleveland regained the lead in the bottom of the sixth. With runners on second and third, Gimenez bounced a Gallen pitch past the drawn-in Arizona infield and into center for a two-RBI single off Gallen, who gave up five runs in seven innings.\n\nMoreno exited with a strained groin in the second.\n\nTuesday's Diamondbacks-Guardians pitching matchup\n\nDiamondbacks at Guardians, 3:40 p.m., Cox, Ch. 34\n\nDiamondbacks LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (13-9, 3.30)* vs. Guardians RHP Ben Lively (10-6, 3.42).\n\n* - Stats from 2023.\n\nAt Progressive Field: Rodriguez will be making his first start of the season after dealing with a slow-to-heal left shoulder injury that first popped up in spring training. ... Rodriguez did not make a proper minor league rehab start; last week, he threw four innings in a simulated game against minor leaguers at the Diamondbacks' spring training complex, Salt River Fields. ... He has faced the Guardians eight times in his career, logging an impressive 2.28 ERA. He saw them four times last season and gave up just two earned runs in 28 2/3 innings (0.63 ERA). ... In a season in which the Guardians have had trouble with their starting rotation, Lively has emerged as a dependable option for them. He has given up two runs or fewer in six of his past eight starts, including his past four in a row. Most recently, he held the Orioles in check on two runs over six innings. ... He averages about 90 mph with his four-seam and two-seam fastballs while also throwing three different breaking balls and a change-up. ... He owns a 7.50 ERA in 24 innings against the Diamondbacks in his career. 2B Ketel Marte is 3 for 5 with a triple and two homers off Lively.\n\nComing up\n\nWednesday: At Cleveland, 10:10 a.m.,

There were four lead changes and five ties in the wild, interleague matchup.\n\nKetel Marte and Gabriel Moreno hit back-to-back homers off Logan Allen to start the game, helping the Diamondbacks move within a percentage point of the top National League wild-card spot and win for the 22nd time in 31 games since June 29.\n\nGold Glove catcher Moreno exited the game with a left groin strain in the second.\n\nThompson (6-3) allowed one run in one inning for the victory, while Justin Martinez picked up his first save of the season. Clase (4-2) had his eight-inning scoreless streak end with the unearned run.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez had three hits, two runs, two stolen bases and an RBI for the Guardians, who have the best record in the majors at 67-45. They also own the top home mark in baseball at 35-18.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez also had three hits and drove in two runs, and Steven Kwan and Bo Naylor had two hits apiece for Cleveland. The Guardians used eight pitchers, including Allen, who allowed two runs in five innings.\n\nAllen was struck on the head by Randal Grichuk's line drive in the first, but the left-hander retired the final 10 batters he faced after being recalled from Triple-A Columbus earlier in the day.\n\nCleveland's beleaguered rotation should receive a boost when Alex Cobb makes his first start since undergoing left hip surgery in the offseason. Manager Stephen Vogt said the right-hander will work one of the four games in Minnesota this weekend.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly (right shoulder strain) will make his first rehab appearance Tuesday for Single-A Hillsboro against Everett. The 35-year-old went 2-0 with a 2.19 ERA in four starts before going on the injured list on April 23.\n\nGuardians: RHP Tanner Bibee (right shoulder tightness) remains on the active roster, despite not pitching since July 29. The staff ace was slated to play catch before the game, and Vogt said his next start will be determined after the session.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGuardians RHP Ben Lively (10-6, 3.43 ERA) pitches the middle game of the three-game series.

Taking three of four games from your division rival who has a shot at the playoffs is always a good feeling, and us cashing in on it is even better. Now we have new series to lock in on during a shorter, but still pretty full, slate of baseball is upon us. Tonight we have the Diamondbacks taking on the Guardians - two teams looking for the playoffs.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are in the playoffs as of today, but it hasn't been all rainbows and sunshine for the desert squad. This team, coming off of their World Series appearance, had every look of a World Series hangover. While they were hitting the ball well (and still are) the pitching looked worn down and tired from the deep playoff run. To a certain extent that isn't overly surprising as it was a lot of the players first times getting that far, and potentially even the first playoff experience. This season they came in with a bit of a target on their back, though I assume most thought it was more of a fluke or luck that the Diamondbacks made it in the first place. Tonight, they get their ace to take the mound with Zac Gallen giving it a go. Gallen has been solid this year, but not quite as dominant as he was last season. He is 9-5 with a 3.56 ERA and a 1.25 WHIP. Strong numbers, certainly, but last season (and even the year before) he would go on stretches of scoreless innings where he was virtually untouchable. He hasn't been that way this season, and time is running out. He has posted back-to-back quality starts though, which is encouraging. Gallen has been worse on the road, allowing 16 earned runs in just 36 road innings over eight starts. That means he isn't even averaging five innings in his road outings. In fairness to him, he did have a start where he didn't record an out against the Mets and was pulled due to injury. There isn't much experience against Gallen from the Guardians, they are just 8-for-35 against him.\n\nThe Guardians control their own destiny and can continue to make progress toward that fate with a win tonight. They've been amazing at home this season, owning a 35-17 record, which is almost all of their 23 games over .500 mark. At the deadline, the Guardians added a bit of power which should help a lineup that was a bit too reliant on Jose Ramirez to get its offense. That isn't to imply the only way the Guardians score is via the longball. The team is hitting .242 which is a strong average and alludes to their small-ball approach. If their pitching can hold up, I don't think anyone will be excited about playing this hard-nosed team. Logan Allen takes the ball for the Guardians today. He has been rather frustrating this season for the Guardians. In every month, his ERA has been over five earned runs. His stuff is better than this, but he doesn't seem to be avoiding a lot of contact, and is walking far too many hitters. He's been worse at home and in night games as well - at home a 6.42 ERA, and 7.12 in night contests.\n\nI don't really enjoy betting on opposing teams in Cleveland. This season, the Guardians have just been too good to fade at home. This is likely a spot that the Guardians lose the game, but I think it is probably safer to assume two things - the pitchers are not in their ideal spots, so offenses should have the edge. The other assumption is that Gallen is significantly better than Allen and should control the game at least through five innings. The books seem to think so as well and I don't like the prices I am seeing on the first five innings. I'll back the over 8.5 for the full game.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Night_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunday Night Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Allen_(baseball,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Allen (baseball, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/07/Jose-Ramirez-Cleveland-Guardians-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792030", "eventUri": "eng-9792030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The southpaw matches up against Cleveland starter Ben Lively.\n\nRodriguez was signed to a four-year, $80 million deal in the offseason. However, he went down with shoulder discomfort during a spring training start and ultimately missed four months.\n\nNow, he faces a familiar foe with the Guardians, a team he faced frequently during his time with the Detroit Tigers the past two years.\n\nRodriguez is 6-0 against the Guardians in his career, posting a 2.28 ERA in 55.1 innings while recording 46 strikeouts.\n\nBesides Lively, who's been one of Cleveland's best starters this season, the Guardians have southpaw Logan Allen and veteran Carlos Carrasco slated to pitch against Arizona this week.\n\nAllen rejoined the Guardians as part of the taxi squad on Sunday and was activated to pitch against the Diamondbacks in his first appearance since being optioned to Triple-A on July 7.\n\nBoth Allen and Carrasco have an ERA over 5.50, and with how hot Arizona's bats have been, the Diamondbacks hope to take advantage.\n\nD-backs: It's the same story every day. Ketel Marte somehow keeps finding ways to improve. He now has 27 home runs and 77 RBIs this season after hitting three homers against the Pirates over the weekend. He's already surpassed his 2023 home run total (25) and continues to make a case for MVP. He ranks second in the National League in WAR (5.8) this season behind Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani.\n\nJosh Bell made a strong first impression with the Diamondbacks, smacking two home runs in the series opener against his former team on Friday. Now, he gets to play another former team -- the Guardians -- and keep his momentum going. In his last 15 games, Bell has slashed .326/.426/.761 while hitting six home runs.\n\nGuardians: An opposing pitcher can struggle at any moment's notice in Cleveland. This series is highlighted by Rodriguez's return to the mound for Arizona, and most of Cleveland's lineup has faced him numerous times before. All-Star third baseman Jose Ramirez is 6-for-24 against Rodriguez, homering twice while striking out five times. However, the switch hitter has put up absurd numbers this season, boasting a .277/.329/.870 slash line while piling together 29 home runs and 93 RBIs. He has also tallied 22 stolen bases in the process.\n\nSteven Kwan is batting .333 this season while Josh Naylor has hit 24 home runs.\n\nAll three games will be televised on DBACKS.TV through channel 34 on Cox.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_schmidt@arizonasports.com", "name": "Aaron Schmidt", "type": "author",

They're especially tough at home, with a 35-17 record. They're coming off a four game series split with the Baltimore Orioles, but dropped the final two games over the weekend.\n\nThe D-backs are 8-2 in their last ten games and 21-9 in their last 30 since June 29th. That is the best record in MLB in that span. Arizona is 29-27 on the road and coming off a hard fought, 2-1 series victory against the Pittsburgh Pirates. That included a come from behind victory in a game started by Paul Skenes.\n\nThe D-backs are five games back of the Dodgers in the NL West, but hold a 1.5 game lead over the New York Mets for the third NL Wild Card spot.\n\nNote: Progressive Field has typically been considered a neutral ballpark, favoring neither hitters nor pitchers. But in 2024 the park has played extremely homer friendly, boasting a111 HR Park factor at Statcast.\n\nThe D-backs are second in MLB with 5.13 runs scored per game, trailing only the New York Yankees (5.16). Their team OPS of .754 ranks 6th. The Guardians rank 11th with 4.67 runs per game, and 13th with a .714 team OPS.\n\nThe gap narrows somewhat when looking at D-backs road and Guardians home splits however. Arizona scores 5.01 runs on the road while posting a .743 OPS. Cleveland scores 4.88 runs per game at home with a .729 OPS.\n\nThe Guardians have a top-heavy lineup led by six-time All-Star Jose Ramirez who is batting .277 with 29 homers, 93 RBI, and a 140 OPS+. Steven Kwan was batting .352 heading into the All-Star Break, but just .246 since. His season line is still an excellent .333/.392/.482, good for a 145 OPS+.\n\nThe Guardians lineup also skews heavily left-handed. First baseman Josh Naylor is batting .250 with 24 homers and a 126 OPS+. Right-handed DH David Fry provides some balance however, batting .279/.382/.445, 133 OPS+.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are led by National League MVP candidate Ketel Marte. The All-Star second baseman is batting an even .300 with 27 homers and a .919 OPS. He's played Gold Glove caliber second base, racking up +11 defensive runs saved.\n\nThe Diamondbacks feature a balanced attack, with eight of their nine starters posting an OPS+ of 100 or higher. OPS+ measures OPS against league average and adjusted for ballpark factors. It's set to a scale where 100 = league average. The higher the better. The D-backs have a team 112 OPS+. Joc Pederson (161) leads the team, just ahead of Marte's 156. Table link.\n\nGallen is coming off a solid start against the Nationals, going six innings and allowing one run on six hits. He's gotten the win in three straight starts, giving up just four runs in 17 innings. The D-backs pen was worked hard in the Pittsburgh series. It's essential that Gallen gets deep into this game, given that Tuesday's starter, Eduardo Rodriguez, will be on a pitch count.\n\nLogan T. Allen LHP, 8-4, 5.67 ERA, 5.45 FIP in 87 IP\n\nAllen's last MLB start came on July 6th. He was demoted to Triple-A Columbus after a spate of poor starts. He's being recalled to fill in for the injured Tanner Bibee who is dealing with shoulder soreness. Allen has been hit hard in the majors this year, giving up 103 hits including 18 homers in just 87 innings.\n\nRodriguez is making his first start with the Diamondbacks this year. He has missed the entire season so far with a left lat strain. Signed during the off season to a four year $80 million contract, Rodriguez was expected to help solidify the Diamondbacks rotation.\n\nRodriguez pitched in a simulation game last week, throwing four innings and roughly 60 pitches. He has not thrown in a minor league rehab game. Expect Rodriguez to be limited to five innings and 75 to 80 pitches maximum.\n\nBen Lively RHP, 10-6, 3.42 ERA, 4.50 FIP in 105 IP\n\nLively is coming off two solid victories against tough lineups. He went six innings, allowing two runs to the Orioles on August 1st, and went six innings giving up one run against the Phillies on July 26th. Lively can give up the long ball at times, having allowed 18 of them this year. But only six of those have come at home.\n\nPfaadt has been a stalwart for the Diamondbacks, leading the team in starts, innings and quality starts in a year the team has suffered multiple injuries in their starting rotation. He has been somewhat prone to the big inning at times and may be tiring a bit. Pfaadt has allowed eight runs in his last 11 innings that have included 14 hits and just seven strikeouts.\n\nCarlos Carrasco RHP, 3-9, 5.53 ERA, 4.79 FIP in 99 IP\n\nThe 37-year-old veteran may be nearing the end. Other than providing innings, he simply has not pitched well this year. Over his last five starts he's not even giving them innings, throwing just 23.1, while posting a 6.56 ERA.\n\nThe strength of the Guardians this year has been their MLB-best bullpen. Not only do they lead the league with a 2.60 reliever ERA, but they seldom blow a lead. Closer Emmanuel Clase has a 0.70 ERA and 33 saves.\n\nTheir primary setup men boast microscopic ERA as well. Cade Smith (1.86), Hunter Gaddis (1.38), and lefty Tim Herrin (1.83) simply don't allow runs. Pedro Avila is solid too, with a 3.04 ERA.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have a 4.30 reliever ERA, 23rd in MLB. The bullpen has been in disarray since early July when Paul Sewald started slumping. He was recently demoted from the closer's role and the team is trying to go with a matchups based committee. It's worked out in their first two save chances on Friday and Sunday, but shakily.\n\nFor now it looks like Ryan Thompson and lefty A.J. Puk will share the load in the ninth inning, depending on the matchup. But don't be surprised if any of Justin Martinez, Kevin Ginkel, Dylan Floro, or even Joe Mantiply pitch the ninth inning at some point.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

There were four lead changes and five ties in the wild, interleague matchup.\n\n\"I was like a proud dad because I watched the entire team rally around each other to get this one,\" Diamondbacks Manager Torey Lovullo said. \"We were exhausted, but I wanted to hug everyone because it was a great win.\"\n\nJoc Pederson belted a two-run homer in the eighth -- the sixth pinch-hit shot of his career -- off Scott Barlow to put Arizona in front 6-5.\n\nThe Diamondbacks moved within a percentage point of the top National League wild-card spot and won for the 22nd time in 31 games since June 29.\n\n\"There is no give up in this team in all aspects, whether we're down in the first inning or in the eighth or ninth,\" Pederson said. \"We just kind of pass the baton to the next guy. It's a real good feeling when you're making it happen.\"\n\nJose Ramirez had 3 hits, 2 runs, 2 stolen bases and an RBI for the Guardians, who have the best record in the majors at 67-45. They also own the top home mark in baseball at 35-18.\n\nKetel Marte and Gabriel Moreno had back-to-back homers off Logan Allen to start the game, which was the third time in franchise history that Arizona has done so. Gold Glove catcher Moreno later exited with a left groin strain and is headed to the injured list.\n\n\"I was going at high intensity and felt a tight pull halfway down the line (on an infield single),\" Moreno said through an interpreter. \"I don't know how long it's going to take because this is the first time I've had this kind of injury.\"\n\nThompson (6-3) allowed one run in one inning for the victory, while Justin Martinez picked up his first save of the season. Clase (4-2) had his eight-inning scoreless streak end with the unearned run.\n\nAndres Gimenez also had three hits and drove in two runs, and Steven Kwan and Naylor had two hits apiece for Cleveland. The Guardians used eight pitchers, including Allen, who allowed two runs in five innings.\n\nAllen was struck on the head by Randal Grichuk's line drive in the first, but the left-hander retired the final 10 batters he faced after being recalled from Class AAA Columbus earlier in the day.\n\n\"I'd rather be up here, even if it's taking balls off the head and giving up homers,\" Allen deadpanned. \"Giving the team a chance to win is all I'm trying to do.\"\n\nTWINS 3, CUBS 0 David Festa struck out a career-high nine over five innings, and Minnesota beat Chicago. Minnesota drew within 3 1/2 games of AL Central-leading Cleveland, the closest the Twins have been to first place since before play on May 18. Making his fifth big league start since his debut on June 27, Festa allowed 2 hits and 2 walks while throwing 82 pitches, 1 more the the previous high for the 24-year-old right-hander.\n\nNATIONAL LEAGUE\n\nGIANTS 4, NATIONALS 1 Matt Chapman homered in his third straight game, Logan Webb pitched into the sixth inning and San Francisco beat Washington. The Giants have won nine of their past 12 games and reached the .500 mark (57-57) for the first time since they entered play on June 1 at 29-29 before an eventual loss to the New York Yankees. Tyler Fitzgerald had two hits and went deep for the second straight game. He has homered in 10 of his past 17 games, with 11 homers total. Webb (9-8) allowed 1 run on 4 hits over 5 2/3 innings.\n\nREDS 10, MARLINS 3 Elly De La Cruz became the youngest Cincinnati player with four extra-base hits in a game since at least 1901 and the Reds overcame Jesus Sanchez's 480-foot home run, the longest in the major league this season, in a 10-3 win over Miami. Nick Martinez pitched five scoreless innings to win on his 34th birthday in his first start since May 22. De La Cruz put Cincinnati ahead with a two-run homer off Roddery Munoz in the first inning, doubled in the fourth and sixth and hit a solo homer in the eighth against Shaun Anderson for his 20th home run this season.\n\nAMERICAN LEAGUE\n\nRANGERS 4, ASTROS 3 (10) Josh Smith hit a game-ending two-run homer in the 10th inning to give Texas a win over Houston. It was the opener of the final series this season between the AL West rivals and last two World Series champions. Smith pulled a 410-foot homer into right-center on a 94 mph fastball from Caleb Ferguson with two outs. That made a winner out of All-Star closer Kirby Yates, who in the top of the 10th hit consecutive batters with pitches, the first a disputed play, to force in a go-ahead run.\n\nRED SOX 9, ROYALS 5 James Paxton pitched six solid innings, Masataka Yoshida tied his career high with four of Boston's 18 hits and the Red Sox beat the Kansas City. Boston, which has won four of its last five, now trails the Royals by 1 1/2 games for the final American League wild card spot. Paxton allowed two runs on five hits to pick up his first win since being traded to the Red Sox by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Brady Singer allowed 4 runs on 10 hits in 5 2/3 innings. He allowed at least one hit in every inning.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks' Jake McCarthy walks to first base after being hit by a pitch in the eighth inning of a baseball game against the Cleveland Guardians in Cleveland, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024.

Tonight, they'll begin an even tougher challenge, facing the MLB-topping Cleveland Guardians. First pitch is at 3:40 p.m. Arizona time.\n\nThe D-backs sit at 60-52, in possession of the third Wild Card spot, with a 1.5 game lead over the Mets behind them. They're only 0.5 games behind both the Padres and Braves in WC1 and WC2, and are 8-2 in their last 10 games.\n\nThe Guardians are 67-44, playing good baseball all season, although they're fresh off back-to-back losses at the hands of the Orioles.\n\nD-backs ace Zac Gallen will start for Arizona. The righty has struggled of late, pitching to a 4.25 ERA in his last seven games. He's had an uncharacteristically tough time limiting traffic, with a 1.42 WHIP in that period as well.\n\nThat said, he's put forward back-to-back Quality Starts, with his last time out saw him pitch six strong innings, allowing just one run and striking out six. Despite having shaky command in his last handful of outings, he still posts a 3.56 ERA and 3.37 FIP\n\nHe'll need to limit mistake pitches and stay around the edge of the zone, as the top of Cleveland's lineup can easily punish pitches left in poor spots. But he'll also have to limit walks and base traffic, as that's been the cause of his recent woes.\n\nAcross from Gallen is left-hander Logan Allen. No, this is not the Logan Allen that pitched for the D-backs this season, rather a young stud who has fallen on some rough times this season.\n\nAllen pitched to a 3.81 ERA last season over 125 1/3 innings. This year, he hasn't looked quite the same. A 5.45 FIP suggests his 5.67 ERA mostly represents how poorly he's pitched in the majors this year, and tonight's start is his first in the majors since July 6th, as he's spent time down in the minor leagues since then.\n\nAllen features a low-velocity arsenal, with a 91 MPH fastball and 79 MPH sweeper. He also throws a soft cutter and changeup, but relies primarily on the fastball.\n\nWhile he does allow some walks, the D-backs will need to look for a different approach than they used on rookie sensation Paul Skenes. Rather than working Allen's pitch count up and prolonging at-bats, they could do some damage to a very hittable arm by attacking early in counts.\n\nWith the Guardians bullpen leading the league in ERA (2.60), Arizona would do well to get some runs and chase Allen early. If they can tire out the Cleveland bullpen, they could sneak a slight advantage for the rest of the series.\n\nWith a left-hander on the mound for the Guardians, Corbin Carroll will sit after hitting his 10th triple of the year in last night's contest.\n\nGabriel Moreno will fill in the two-hole, with Ketel Marte leading off. Marte crushed his 27th home run yesterday, and will look to continue his dominant 2024 campaign, but will be the DH, and get a day off his feet defensively.\n\nMarte currently boasts the highest OPS in the NL since June 23rd (1.104), while his teammate, third baseman Eugenio Suarez is second at .993.\n\nAs a whole, Arizona has benefited from the long ball greatly in their hot July, as they've hit the third-most home runs in the majors since July 1st, with 48, although they've still found ways to create chaos and manufacture runs without slugging heavily.\n\nThe Guardians will trot out a left-hand heavy lineup to combat Gallen. The top of Cleveland's order has been dangerous, with leadoff man Steven Kwan is hitting .333, while new acquisition Lane Thomas will hit second.\n\nAs always, switch-hitting third baseman Jose Ramirez remains a massive threat from both sides of the plate. He's been especially hot of late, slugging 1.038 in his last seven games, while slashing .277/.329/.541 on the season with 29 home runs.\n\nArizona will have their hands full with the Guardians, but remain unbeaten in their last 10 series.

He signed a four-year, $80 million deal with Arizona as a free agent back in December 2023 after going 13-9 with a 3.30 ERA in 26 starts for the Detroit Tigers last year.\n\nRodriguez has been eager to get back on the mound.\n\n\"It's frustrating every time someone else is up there in your spot when you're supposed to be out there pitching,\" Rodriguez said. \"I wasn't there, so watching the games when that was happening was a little frustrating for me, especially when I was in the middle of all the MRIs and all that.\n\n\"That's what I want to do, I want to go out there and show what I can do. I want to help the team.\"\n\nCleveland is about the best team Rodriguez could make his return against, as the 31-year-old is 6-0 with a 2.28 ERA in eight career starts against the Guardians.\n\nAnd the Diamondbacks are red hot, improving to 22-9 since June 29 thanks to Monday's 7-6, 10-inning win over Cleveland.\n\nJoc Pederson hit a pinch-hit, two-run homer in the eighth inning for the Diamondbacks in the series opener, and Eugenio Suarez drove in the winning run with a sacrifice fly in the top of the 10th. Arizona also started the game with a bang, getting back-to-back solo shots from Ketel Marte and Gabriel Moreno to open the first.\n\nMeanwhile, the Guardians have been skidding, as they have dropped three straight games on the heels of a five-game winning streak.\n\nCleveland third baseman Jose Ramirez hasn't let the team's struggles get to him, though. He went 3-for-4 with two runs and an RBI on Monday and is batting .424 (14-for-33) with five homers and 12 RBIs over his past nine games.\n\nTeammate Andres Gimenez has also been in the zone, going 14-for-38 (.368) during an active 10-game hitting streak.\n\nRamirez and Gimenez will attempt to get the Guardians back on track along with right-hander Ben Lively (10-6, 3.42 ERA), who is set to make his 20th start of the season on Tuesday.\n\nLast time out, Lively lasted six innings against the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday. He gave up two runs on four hits to earn a win.\n\nLively is 2-2 with a 2.78 ERA in his past four starts.\n\n\"It's almost like he comes into every game feeling his way through and he finds what's working and sticks with it,\" Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said of Lively. \"He's willing to make adjustments. He's willing to do different things to get outs and he just continues to give us a chance to win every time out.\"\n\nTuesday marks Lively's sixth career appearance (fifth start) vs. Arizona. He is 0-2 with a 7.50 ERA against the Diamondbacks.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@miamiherald.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joc_Pederson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joc Pederson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketel_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketel Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eugenio Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Vogt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Vogt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_streak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hitting streak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/4z8kgj/picture290782759/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/d2bb5c56-75d8-499f-88ea-ef7855494727", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792030", "eventUri": "eng-9792030", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-28", "textStart": 271, "textEnd": 279}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 1146, "textEnd": 1153}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

One of the series opening up is the Arizona Diamondbacks vs. the Cleveland Guardians at Progressive Field.\n\nArizona is surging. Cleveland has played well, too, despite back-to-back losses. Each team will have their eyes on the postseason and making a run once they get there. With each passing week, the games increase in importance for both teams. This opening week series is no different.\n\nWhat's the best bet here? Read on for my free MLB picks and Diamondbacks vs Guardians predictions on Monday, August 5\n\nMany signs are pointing to runs this evening, and that's where we're headed for today's best bet. I projected a total of 9.3, so getting a full run of value feels like an edge you can't pass up.\n\nSimply put, I have Logan Allen as one of the worst starting pitchers in the MLB this season, and nothing about that is controversial. One of the best measures of this is his expected ERA, which is above 5.5 and has settled into the bottom 5% of the sport. Three of his last four starts have gone over, and he's been a big part of that, allowing four or more runs in all three. Today, he faces a few particular issues.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks can attack Allen where he struggles the most, and that's giving up hard contact.\n\nHe ranks in the bottom 5% of baseball in all three key metrics: average exit velocity, barrel rate, and hard-hit rate. The Snakes are good in this regard overall and do it well against lefties. They'll come into this one with the 10th-best hard-hit rate against left-handed pitchers in baseball and the 8th-best isolated power rating. That's plenty good enough against a pitcher who has been so poor this season. The \"other numbers\" aren't bad either, as Arizona comes in at the Top 5 in slugging percentage, batting average, and baBIP.\n\nOn the other side is Zac Gallen, who can't seem to figure it out on the road. The splits tell the story. Gallen's road ERA is almost two full runs higher than his home one. In addition, he's had issues similar to those of his counterpart despite being a much more efficient pitcher.\n\nHe'll come into this game with only slightly better numbers than Allen regarding the hard-hit ball, with a hard-hit rate in the bottom ten percentile and average exit velocity. Cleveland has kind of sneakily been one of the better offenses in baseball, and I'm expecting them to have success here. Josh Naylor, Lane Thomas, and Jose Ramirez all have power numbers that place them roughly in the 20th percentile of the league. That should be enough to get after Gallen this evening.\n\nIt will be warm in Cleveland, with winds blowing out and ideal conditions for fireworks -- expect them and bet accordingly.\n\nThis is a simple analysis for me: Take the player who hits the ball the hardest among all players today against a pitcher who gives up so much hard contact. It helps that Marte's numbers go up against left-handed pitching, too.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks have hit the Moneyline in 35 of their last 55 games (+14.10 Units / 20% ROI).

However, the Guardians answered in the ninth when Bo Naylor drove a pitch from Ryan Thompson (6-3) off the 19-foot-high wall in left-center field that went for a triple.

It is a night he will long remember if the Guardians go on to make the playoffs and he gets to play a prominent role in the postseason.\n\nThe Guardians lost to the Diamondbacks, 7-6, in 10 innings, at Progressive Field. The Twins blanked the Cubs, 3-0, to cut Cleveland's lead to 3.5 games in the Central Division. The Guards have lost three straight.\n\nThe story of this game, though, is about how Allen survived -- survived is the correct word as you will learn -- a nightmarish first inning to prove he belongs in the Guardians' rotation.\n\n\"One inning doesn't define an outing,\" Allen said after the game. \"You always have a chance to pick yourself up. The team is going to keep us in it. It's on me to keep us in it as well, and I think I was able to do that. I got a lot more efficient after the first.\"\n\nAllen was demoted to Triple-A Columbus on July 7. Oddly enough, the demotion came one day after he struck out a season-high nine batters in a 5-4 win over the San Francisco Giants. Allen was lifted after throwing 93 pitches in 4 1/3 innings, so he was not credited with the win. He walked four batters in addition to the nine strikeouts. He gave up three hits and was charged with two runs. Walks, 35 allowed in 87 1/3 innings, factored into Allen being sent down. He was 8-4 but had a 5.67 ERA.\n\n\"I think it's an opportunity for Logan to go down and get some consistency back,\" manager Stephen Vogt said on July 8. \"We've seen it where he'll have one outing where he's out there, he's efficient, filling up the strike zone, and he goes six innings. Then he'll have one where he kind of struggles, throws a lot of pitches, struggles to find the strike zone, and doesn't quite make it that far.\"\n\nThe Guardians' starting rotation is a mess. Tanner Bibee is dealing with a shoulder injury, though he is not on the injured list. Carlos Carrasco, who gives everything he has every time he pitches, nevertheless is 3-9 with a 5.53 ERA. Gavin Williams (1-4, 4.91 ERA, seven starts) has been Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde since being activated from the injured list last month. Ben Lively -- no one would have predicted it in April -- at 10-6 has been the Guardians' most consistent pitcher.\n\nPresident of Baseball Operations Chris Antonetti, desperate for starting pitching, signed Matthew Boyd and at the trade deadline acquired Alex Cobb from the Giants. Boyd and Cobb are recovering from injuries. Both are close to being added to the 26-man roster. Carrasco will likely be shifted to the bullpen to pitch in long relief when Cobb and/or Boyd join the rotation, but that still means something else has to give. And Allen knew it as he took the mound in the top of the first against the Diamondbacks.\n\nAllen was 2-0 in three starts (3.86 ERA) in his recent stint in Columbus. His return to the Guardians could not have gotten off to a worse start.\n\nKetel Marte swatted Allen's first pitch over the wall in left-center. The next batter, Gabriel Moreno, homered to left on the fourth pitch he saw. The next batter, Lourdes Gurriel Jr., lined a single to center.\n\nJosh Bell grounded into a double play, but then the next batter, Randal Grichuk, lined a single up the middle off the left side of Allen's head.\n\nVogt and trainer Jeff Desjardins ran out of the dugout to check on Allen. Desjardins examined Allen's head and neck.\n\nAllen easily could have said he was in too much pain to continue. But he did not do that. He walked the next two batters, loading the bases with Snakes, and that is when he grew up.\n\nAllen retired Kevin Newman on a fly to left to end the inning. The first two Arizona batters in the second inning grounded out. Moreno singled off Allen's ankle in the second inning, then Gurriel flied out to end the inning. Allen put the Diamondbacks down in order in the third, fourth and fifth innings, and by the time Vogt went to the bullpen in the top of the sixth, the Guardians had a 3-2 lead.\n\n\"The Good Lord was looking out for me, for sure,\" Allen said. \"I've been hit quite a bit this year. I have to find a way to take the magnet out of my glove.\n\n\"I'm thankful to be back here. When I'm in Triple-A, I'd rather be up here, even if it's taking balls off the head and giving up homers. Giving the team a chance to win is all I'm trying to do. I was happy to do it.\"\n\nUncharacteristically, the bullpen failed to hold the lead. That doesn't diminish how Allen persevered.", "source": {"uri": "news-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_schudel@news-herald.com", "name": "Jeff

Mandatory Credit: David Richard-USA TODAY Sports / David Richard-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians have optioned starting pitcher Logan Allen back down to the minors after returning for just one start, via Mandy Bell of MLB.com.\n\nAs a corresponding move, the Guardians have called up pitcher Anthony Gose. They also designated right-hander Xzavion Curry for assignment.\n\nAllen put forth a decent showing against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday, giving up two runs on five hits in five innings of work. Both runs were the result of solo homers.\n\nThe lefty has been a disappointment on the season overall, pitching to the tune of a 5.56 ERA while registering a 1.538 WHIP across 92.1 frames. He has surrendered 108 hits while recording 78 strikeoouts.\n\nThis comes after a rather impressive rookie campaign for Allen in 2023, when he went 7-8 with 3.81 ERA through 24 starts.\n\nMeanwhile, Gose will be appearing on the big-league level for the first time since 2022.\n\nFormerly an outfielder, the 33-year-old Gose became a pitcher following the 2016 season with the Detroit Tigers. He signed a minor-league dela with the Guardians in December 2018.\n\nGose has appeared in 28 games out of the bullpen for Cleveland since then, going 3-0 with a 3.90 ERA over 28 outings.\n\nCurry was drafted by the Guardians in 2019 and made his major-league debut in 2022.

But Arizona finds itself a slight road underdog in Tuesday's Diamondbacks vs Guardians odds.\n\nTuesday's MLB odds list Cleveland as a -112 home favorite with Arizona coming back as a -104 underdog. The run total is sitting at 8.0 with the under slightly favored at -112.\n\nOn the runline, Arizona is +155 to win by multiple runs while Cleveland is priced at -188 to keep the score within a single run.\n\nOdds as of August 6 at FanDuel. See the full list of online betting deposit methods.\n\nArizona won the opening game of the series on Monday night, 7-6 in extra innings. The back-and-forth affair featured five lead changes. After Arizona reliever Ryan Thompson coughed up a 6-5 lead in the bottom of the ninth, Eugenio Suarez singled home what proved to be the winning run in the top of the 10th against almost-unhittable Cleveland closer Emmanuel Clase (0.69 ERA).\n\nThe MLB public betting trends for Tuesday show Cleveland getting 85% of the moneyline handle as of 11:15 am ET, while the public is also hammering the over (88% of handle on over 8.0 runs).\n\nHolding a 3.5-game lead over Minnesota in the AL Central, Cleveland is a -200 favorite in the MLB division odds. Sitting five games back of the Dodgers in the NL West, Arizona is as long as +1600 to win their division.\n\nA shoulder/back injury during spring training has kept Rodriguez out for the entirety of his first season with the D-backs. Coming off the best season of his career last year with the Tigers, the 31-year-old lefty has ample familiarity with the Guardians. In four starts against Cleveland last year, he combined to go 28.2 innings while allowing just two runs on 16 hits with 29 strikeouts. His Tigers were 4-0 in those games.\n\nThe current Cleveland lineup is slashing .243/.264/.429 against the Venezuelan in 70 total ABs with three home runs (two from Jose Ramirez), four doubles, 13 Ks, and just two walks.\n\nBen Lively less history against the Arizona lineup, and it's much more concerning. In 36 total at-bats, Diamondback hitters have a .306 average and 1.014 OPS against the 32-year-old righty. Ketel Marte is 3-for-5 off lively with two home runs. As a group, Arizona has more RBI off Lively (seven) than strikeouts (four), with an equal number of walks.\n\nThe bulk of that history stems from two appearances last year when Lively was with the Reds. He combined to allow five runs on 14 hits and two walks over 10.1 innings (1.55 WHIP) with eight Ks.\n\nLively is having a career year this season, though, and picked up where he left off after the All-Star break. In three starts since the hiatus, Lively has allowed five runs on 13 hits and five walks in 17.1 innings (1.04 WHIP). The Guardians are 2-1 in his starts, with the only setback a 2-1 loss to the Padres on July 21.\n\nIt's hard to be too bullish on Rodriguez in his first start of the season but when you couple his phenomenal track record against the Guardians with Lively's checkered past against the D-back hitters, I am much more comfortable backing Arizona on the first-half moneyline.\n\nI'm also going to back Marte, who is priced at +150 to record an RBI, to continue his run of success against Lively.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"},

The veteran worked a 3-2 count and clobbered a hanging curveball 406 feet.\n\nOn Sunday, Pederson belted a go-ahead, three-run shot in the seventh inning of a 6-5 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Eight of his 18 home runs have come in the seventh inning or later.\n\nThe D-backs tasked Ryan Thompson to record the save, but Cleveland scored the game-tying run with a Daniel Schneemann sacrifice fly in the ninth. Bo Naylor tripled after a miscommunication in the outfield between Jake McCarthy and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. after the ball hit the wall, which led to an extra base.\n\nArizona entered Monday's game 3-7 in extras, but the offense converted this time as Eugenio Suarez delivered the go-ahead sac fly.\n\nMartinez got another opportunity in a critical spot and struck out the final two batters for the save. The D-backs' ninth inning role will be fluid, as Thompson, Puk and Martinez have recorded saves on this road trip. Thompson has thrown 2.1 innings with three earned runs since Paul Sewald was removed from the closer spot.\n\nThe Guardians entered Monday's game 30-0 when leading at home after seven innings played. They have MLB's best home record, entering Monday 35-17 and 12-5 in series openers.\n\nArizona improved to 22-9 over its last 31 games, best in MLB.\n\nPederson's home run continued a terrific season for the veteran free agent signee. He ranks fourth among MLB designated hitters with a .946 OPS, only trailing All-Stars Shohei Ohtani, Marcell Ozuna and Brent Rooker. He is making a case for most impactful free agent bat the D-backs have signed since Mike Hazen took over as general manager after 2016.\n\nThe Diamondbacks quickly jumped ahead, as Ketel Marte and Gabriel Moreno hit back-to-back home runs to lead off the ballgame. Marte drilled the first pitch of the game from Logan Allen over the fence in left field. It was his fifth leadoff homer of the year and league-leading 15th home run off left-handed pitching.\n\nBut the Guardians answered against D-backs ace Zac Gallen with two runs in the bottom half and a third in the second inning.\n\nArizona took the lead with two runs in the sixth, one on a Suarez RBI double. The Guardians came right back as Andres Gimenez poked a two-run single up the middle. Cleveland's batters did a nice job getting the bat on pitches just out of the zone to make something happen. All four RBI hits off Gallen were on pitches on the black or off the edge.\n\nGallen struck out four batters, walked two and gave up eight hits for five earned runs in seven innings.\n\nThe Diamondbacks faced early adversity, as catcher Gabriel Moreno exited with a left groin strain during the second inning.\n\nThe series is on the line Tuesday, and Eduardo Rodriguez is set to make his team debut after spending the first four months on the injured list (shoulder). Ben Lively will throw for Cleveland.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_weiner@arizonasports.com", "name": "Alex

His long layoff doesn't exactly bode well for limiting runs in our Diamondbacks vs. Guardians predictions.\n\nWe haven't seen Eduardo Rodriguez pitch in a game of any kind since spring training after the lefty chose to rehab his shoulder at the Arizona Diamondbacks' complex. What we do know is that Rodriguez struggled in the spring to an 8.00 ERA in nine innings, allowing three homers in four outings.\n\nRodriguez stayed healthy last year after an abbreviated 2022 campaign, but he pitched more to contact in his two years with the Detroit Tigers, posting a .248 expected batting average in the process. This sat just a hair above the league average but was significantly higher than the marks he'd been posting in Boston.\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians may not hit the ball all that hard, but they've slugged anyway with a 13th-ranked .159 isolated power this season and have brought that up to .179 over the past two weeks. They continue to exhibit excellence in putting the ball in play and rank eighth in wRC+ vs. lefties compared to 16th against righties. That gap only figures to widen after adding a lefty killer in Lane Thomas at the deadline.\n\nCleveland's offensive outlook here should be strong against a pitcher who's yet to work in a game this year even at the minor-league level, but we can't be so sure Ben Lively will thrive against a strong Arizona offense either.\n\nWhile the Diamondbacks have consistently put the ball on the ground, they've excelled against fly-ball arms with a .744 OPS to rank eighth in baseball and sit just 15th in the same category against ground-ballers.\n\nLively allows an extreme 31.1% of batted balls to travel through the air, and that doesn't sound so appetizing against a Diamondbacks team that's sporting a ridiculous .275 ISO over the last two weeks and now gets to hit in a park that's been much friendlier for home runs this year than in years past.\n\nI expect someone to leave the yard here against Lively, who's allowed a whopping 17 long balls in 19 starts, and Eugenio Suarez is the man I'll back. The slugger has five homers over the last two weeks to tie for second on the team and he's clubbed seven off fly-ball pitchers to rank second in this lineup with a solid .814 OPS.\n\nThen, with the heavy lifting taken care of, I'll back Lively to go Under 4.5 strikeouts for a fourth time in six starts. Arizona is striking out at a minuscule 14.5% clip over the last two weeks to lead baseball and now ranks sixth-best for the season, so it should have no issues getting the ball back in play against a middling punchout pitcher.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks have hit the Game Total Over in 33 of their last 49 games (+16.05 Units / 30% ROI).

Thus ended a thrilling, see-saw battle in the bottom of the 10th inning, as the Diamondbacks won 7-6.\n\nMartinez was dominant, recording two strikeouts in the inning, and may be showing his manager he could ultimately be the answer at the closer's position. While it may be premature to anoint him the closer, his performance will certainly put him back in the mix to win the role. It was his first save this season, having failed in one prior ninth inning attempt.\n\nThe victory came at a cost however, as Gold Glove catcher Gabriel Moreno went down with a left groin strain, and is almost certainly headed to the Injured List. Torey Lovullo said after the game that Moreno would head back to Phoenix to be examined by the team's doctors. \"We know he's going to be down for a little while.\"\n\nJoc Pederson came off the bench in the eighth inning to deliver another clutch home run, a two-run shot to right off Scott Barlow. That put the D-backs up 6-5. The lead didn't hold however, as Ryan Thompson gave up a run in the ninth inning to blow the save and send it to extra innings.\n\nThe D-backs scored their \"Ghost Runner\" Corbin Carroll in the top of the tenth to take the lead. He advanced to third on a bunt by Jake McCarthy and scored on a sacrifice fly from Eugenio Suarez.\n\nThe game started with Ketel Marte hitting a home run on the first pitch of the game from Guardians starter Logan T. Allen. It was Marte's 28th homer of the year fifth leadoff homer of the year. He was followed by Gabriel Moreno, who also hit a solo shot to spot Zac Gallen a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe D-backs ace could not hold the lead, immediately giving it up in the bottom of the first inning that included a Jose Ramirez RBI double. Gallen gave up another run on a double and a base hit in the second inning, as the D-backs fell behind 3-2.\n\nLogan Allen settled down over the next four innings, putting up zeroes through the fifth inning. The D-backs offense got back to work against reliever Cade Smith in the 6th however. Singles by Josh Bell and Jake McCarthy were followed by an RBI double from Suarez and an RBI groundout from Geraldo Perdomo.\n\nOnce again, Gallen could not protect the lead, giving up two runs on a two-run single from Andres Gimenez, as the Guardians took the lead back 5-4. Gallen managed to get through the seventh inning however and was in line for the win following Pederson's homer.\n\nEnding up with a no decision, Gallen's final line was 7 IP, 8 H, 5 ER, 3 BB, 4 K. His ERA now stands at 3.75.\n\nThe D-backs are now 61-52, including 21-12 in one-run games. They're in a three-way virtual tie with the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres in the NL Wild Card. The New York Mets are 1.5 games back.\n\nGame two of the series is Tuesday afternoon at 3:40 p.m. Arizona time.

He opened the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks by giving up back-to-back home runs, and then it got worse. He gave up a single, was able to get a double play, then threw a 1-0 sweeper that Randal Grichuk lined right off the side of his head at 105 mph.\n\nVideo is below, be warned it's pretty violent.\n\nThankfully it looked like Allen got his left hand up and deflected the ball slightly before it crashed into his skull. Somehow, Allen was able to stay in the game. He also limited the damage and escaped the first inning with a 2-0 deficit.\n\nHere's hoping he's O.K.\n\nAllen entered the game with an 8-4 record in 18 starts, but he is sporting an ERA of 5.67, a WHIP of 1.55, 76 strikeouts, 35 walks, and 100 hits allowed in 87 1/3 innings.

Ben Lively has been an unexpected success story in his age-35 season, and Tanner Bibee has had a strong year. Outside of those two? The Guardians would love the final two months of the season to be a smoother ride than the first four-plus.\n\nShane Bieber looked to be back to his Cy Young candidate levels before being lost for the season (at least 2024) to Tommy John surgery, which had him fighting back tears.\n\nCarlos Carrasco, at 37, has held his rotation spot, but barely, posting a 5.53 ERA. Xzavion Curry and Joey Cantillo have mostly been in Triple-A.\n\nTriston McKenzie and Logan Allen were each optioned to Columbus -- down I-71 -- to correct their respective issues, as both had ERAs balloon to north of 5.00.\n\nGavin Williams missed the first several months of the season while on the injured list, and it's been a mixed bag of outings since he returned.\n\nAlex Cobb and Matthew Boyd were each acquired before the trade deadline, though neither has pitched in a major league game in 2024.\n\nTrade grades: Guardians trade deadline grades, analysis | Cleveland adds Lane Thomas, Alex Cobb\n\nSomehow, the Guardians have to figure out how they'll piece together the rotation. And for the final 50 games of the season, it could be essentially a day-by-day operation.\n\n\"Well, since I've been in the organization, I think one thing we do very well is communicate,\" said pitching coach Carl Willis. \"It's constant communication [between the majors, minors, front office and player development staff] ... so we can collectively make the best decisions we can and gather the most information we can.\"\n\nWillis noted they typically like to keep a rotation planner that is scheduled -- in very, very light pencil -- three weeks to a month out. Willis called it a \"constantly changing document.\"\n\nNo kidding.\n\nGuardians starting rotation a key factor in postseason push\n\nThe rotation might also be the biggest obstacle between the Guardians and a trip to the postseason. It isn't just the unknowns for that group itself -- it's also that they don't want to overextend baseball's No. 1 bullpen.\n\nThat bullpen is a major reason why the Guardians have been one of baseball's biggest surprises this season, but they also need to get to October with that group as rested as possible. That's where the starting rotation -- and its efforts to pitch as deep into games as possible -- becomes a key factor.\n\n\"I think in regards to the rotation, I don't think it's been as difficult,\" Willis said. \"I mean, obviously it was a big punch in the gut losing Shane early on. ... The difference this year in comparison to prior years in Cleveland, our starters haven't gone as deep into the games, and so it's been more of a challenge managing the bullpen. We're leaning on these guys a lot.\"\n\nGuardians entering key series with Twins\n\nThe Guardians are juggling a lot of factors heading into a crucial series against the second-place Minnesota Twins this weekend, which begins with a doubleheader Friday.\n\nBibee has been dealing with some shoulder soreness, and his day in the rotation has been pushed back although he should start one of the games in Minnesota over the weekend.\n\nCobb, coming back from a blister (by way of a shoulder issue and, before that, hip surgery) could also make his Guardians debut this weekend against the Twins.\n\nBoyd, coming back from Tommy John surgery, might be in that same boat. Pitchers returning from that injury often need some additional time to really find their footing, and Boyd's career 4.94 ERA in the majors isn't ideal. But the Guardians have liked how he's thrown without caution lately.\n\n\"I think coming off Tommy John ... sometimes you see a little bit of hesitancy with guys coming back from the surgery in terms of trusting their arms and really getting that extension,\" Willis said. \"There's none of that with Matt right now, and I think his outings have proven he is a strike-thrower.\"\n\nThrough all of that planning for the weekend series against the Twins, it's entirely possible Carrasco will lose his spot in the rotation, but nothing has been determined along those lines just yet.\n\nWith Williams, who was just roughed up by the Baltimore Orioles, the Guardians have seen progress with his pitch profiles and movement, but it's clear he isn't quite back to where he wants to be just yet.\n\n\"Yeah, he's still trying to find it, but he is gradually getting there,\" Willis said. \"I mean, we have seen the metrics of [his cutter] go from a negative cut to a positive cut. ... I think it can go a little more left, but it's going more left. Several starts ago, it wasn't going left at all, so he's making that adjustment.\"\n\nLogan Allen returns from Triple-A\n\nAllen returned to the rotation Monday night, and it looked like his trip to Cleveland might be a very short one after he allowed two home runs in his first five pitches of the game in the Guardians' 7-6 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nBut after that horrendous start -- which included him taking a line drive off his head, though he remained in the game -- Allen settled down, allowing just one hit after the first inning and at one point retiring 10 consecutive batters.\n\nDuring his stint in Triple-A Columbus, Allen worked on trusting his stuff in the zone again. He had begun to get too fine as he pitched to the corners a bit too much.\n\n\"Just trusting my stuff in zone, not trying to nibble too much, just going right after guys and making them earn it,\" Allen said. \"I had my fair share of getting deep in accounts, so just trying to do my best to go right after guys and make them earn their way on by swinging the bat instead of free passes.\"\n\nThat efficiency for Allen, like the others in this group of potential starters for the Guardians, is key, not only for him but for a bullpen they're hoping to protect as much as possible.\n\nAnd Allen is just happy to be back in Cleveland, even if it means taking a line drive off the head and another one off his leg later in the game.\n\n\"I'm thankful to be back here,\" Allen said. \"[If I'm in] Triple-A, I'd rather be up here, even if it's taking balls off the head, giving up homers. But just giving the team a chance to win is all I'm trying to do.\"\n\nZooming out, the Guardians have 10 pitchers -- Bibee, Cobb, Williams, Lively, Allen, McKenzie, Cantillo, Curry, Carrasco and Boyd -- to fill five spots in the rotation. It's a matter of figuring out which five, even it it means shuffling the deck a few times, and doing so as the race for the American League Central crown heats up.", "source": {"uri":

Guardians breakfast", "body": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Is it getting a little hot in here? A little tight around the collar?\n\nCan somebody open a window or turn on the AC?\n\nThe Guardians lead in the AL Central is down to 3 1/2 games over the Twins. Not to be an alarmist, but let's at least bang the gong.\n\nMonday night the Guards lost in 10 innings to Arizona, 7-6. It was their first extra-inning loss at home this season.\n\nTwice they had late-inning leads and twice the perfect bullpen wasn't so perfect. It was the second straight game in which the bullpen couldn't stop the other team.\n\nIs it just a hiccup against playoff contenders Baltimore and Arizona? Or is all the work the pen has done over the first 112 games of the season to hide a short rotation taking a toll?\n\nFor sure those are interesting questions.\n\nThe D-Backs, winners of nine of their last 11 games, will provide some of the answers Tuesday and Wednesday. But the truth, at least a portion of it, is coming this weekend when the Guardians go to Target Field for a four-game series that begins with a day-night doubleheader on Friday.\n\nThe Guardians are 5-0 against the Twins, but the team teams haven't played since late May. The Twins have won five straight, the Guardians have lost three straight. Meanwhile, Cleveland has yet to set its rotation for the weekend.\n\nOn Friday, following a 8-4 win over the Orioles, the Guardians had a six-game lead in the division. It's almost half that now and there are still 50 games to play.\n\nTrivia time: It's Tuesday morning and nothing looks good for breakfast besides that leftover piece of chocolate cake from your 5-year-old's birthday party the night before. Go ahead, take it. You can feel guilty afterward. Until then try this one for size -- What former Indians' shortstop scored the winning run in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the 2001 World Series to give Arizona the championship over the Yankees? Answer below.\n\nThe Guardians could use a helping hand and Ben Lively (10-6, 3.42) has been providing it all season long. Lively, making his 20th start, is coming off a 10-3 win over the Orioles on Thursday at Progressive Field.\n\nLively held the Orioles to two runs on four hits in six innings. He leads the Guards' rotation in wins and is second in innings pitched.\n\nThe Snakes added an interesting plot twist to tonight game when they announced Monday that lefty Eduardo Rodriguez would be making his first start of the season.\n\nIt's no accident Rodriguez will make his 2024 debut against Cleveland.

He told reporters at the time he planned to continue throwing. Spring training was winding down, but he expected to be back sooner than later.\n\nThat was 4 1/2 months ago, but Rodriguez's return -- his Diamondbacks debut -- is finally here. He will take the ball against the Guardians on Tuesday night in Cleveland.\n\n\"I've been down there (rehabbing at Salt River Fields) for almost five months,\" Rodriguez said Sunday in Pittsburgh. \"It's been a grind, but I'm finally here and I'm really excited for it.\"\n\nWhen they signed him in December to a four-year, $80 million deal, the Diamondbacks thought they were getting the rotation piece they lacked last October, when they felt forced to run bullpen games twice in the playoffs. Of course, they also wanted a pitcher who would give them more than 10 regular-season starts -- which is about the most Rodriguez can give at this point -- but he can still potentially be a postseason contributor.\n\n\"I'm glad that I'm going to pitch this season and be able to help the team for that last push,\" Rodriguez said. \"That's what we're really looking for and what I've prepared myself to go out there and do, help my team to go to the postseason again.\"\n\nAt first, it looked like Rodriguez's original estimate would prove correct. Within a few weeks, he was back on a mound and working toward a return. But in the second week of April, in his second bullpen session following the injury, he felt more discomfort and was shut down.\n\n\"It was supposed to be just a couple of weeks and it ended up being five months,\" he said. \"It was really frustrating, but now I'm here.\"\n\nRodriguez said this is the longest he has ever been sidelined by an injury, but injuries are nothing new for him; his checkered health history was something the Diamondbacks weighed before signing him in the winter.\n\nRodriguez had stints on the injured list for knee problems early in his career and ultimately needed surgery in 2017. He missed time with rib cage and ankle issues. He missed all of 2020 due to a heart condition caused by a bout with COVID. Last year, he was out for more than a month with a finger injury.\n\nBy and large, however, when he has pitched he has been largely effective. He certainly was last year. In 26 starts, he posted a 3.30 ERA, throwing 152 2/3 innings with 48 walks and 143 strikeouts. He does not overpower but instead is an expert at hitting spots, at forcing hitters to make decisions with almost every pitch.\n\nWhen he was younger, his fastball sat in the 94-95 mph range. The past few years he was mostly 91-92 mph. That was the range he was in last week in a simulated game at Salt River Fields. He leans on his change-up and cutter against righties, mixes in more sliders and sinkers against lefties, all with close to pinpoint command while limiting hard contact. He also likes to work quickly.\n\n\"His bullpens are impressive,\" said Diamondbacks right-hander Merrill Kelly, who has been rehabbing alongside Rodriguez at Salt River Fields most of the summer.\n\n\"He doesn't miss too many spots. I think that's what he's prided himself on his whole career. I think that's one of the reasons why he's as good as he is and on the contract that he is. Watching from the sidelines it's fun to watch.\"\n\nFor Rodriguez, it seems the hard part is over. The mental grind of being hurt, of rehabbing and missing more than four months of the year, is over. It is finally time for him to pitch, and he said he wouldn't be trying to make up for all the missed time in one outing.\n\n\"For me, it's just go out there and do my job,\" he said. \"I'm not really thinking about outcomes and all that. I just want to go out there and do my job and help the team to win. I'll throw the ball, throw strikes and get people out. That's all I'm thinking every time I go out there on the mound.\"\n\nTuesday's Diamondbacks-Guardians pitching matchup\n\nDiamondbacks at Guardians, 3:40 p.m., Cox, Ch. 34\n\nDiamondbacks LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (13-9, 3.30)* vs. Guardians RHP Ben Lively (10-6, 3.42).\n\n* - Stats from 2023.\n\nAt Progressive Field: Rodriguez will be making his first start of the season after dealing with a slow-to-heal left shoulder injury that first popped up in spring training. ... Rodriguez did not make a proper minor league rehab start; last week, he threw four innings in a simulated game against minor leaguers at the Diamondbacks' spring training complex, Salt River Fields. ... He has faced the Guardians eight times in his career, logging an impressive 2.28 ERA. He saw them four times last season and gave up just two earned runs in 28 2/3 innings (0.63 ERA). ...

He averages about 90 mph with his four-seam and two-seam fastballs while also throwing three different breaking balls and a change-up. ...

Guardians Game Preview: The Return of Eduardo Rodriguez", "body": "Eduardo Rodriguez pitches in a 4-inning simulated game at Salt River Fields on July 31, 2024, in Scottsdale. Rodriguez has yet to throw in the 2024 season due to a shoulder injury. / Megan Mendoza/The Republic / USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks are in Cleveland to play the second of three games against the Guardians. Arizona took the first game of the series in extra innings, 7-6.\n\nToday's matchup features the season debut of left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez. Signed to a four year, $80 million dollar contract during the offseason, Rodriguez suffered a left lat strain in spring training, causing him to miss the first four months of the season.\n\nThe 30 year old Rodriguez has a career 82-53 record, 4.03 ERA and a 3.85 FIP in 1,100 innings. Last year he was 13-9 with a 3.30 ERA in 26 starts. Four of those wins came against the Guardians, while posting a 0.63 ERA in 28.2 innings.\n\nRodriguez threw a four inning, 65 pitch simulation game at Salt River Fields on July 31st in preparation for this outing. Unlike Merrill Kelly, who is pitching tonight in High-A Hillsboro, Rodriguez did not go on a minor league rehab assignment.\n\nRight-hander Ben Lively, (10-6, 3.42 ERA, 4.50 FIP, 105 IP) takes the mound for the Guardians. Lively has a career 8.35 ERA in four starts against the Diamondbacks, but only one of those outings came after 2018. He took a no decision on July 21st of last year while pitching for the Cincinnati Reds, giving up three runs in 4.2 innings of work.\n\nThe Diamondbacks will be without catcher Gabriel Moreno for a while, The Gold Glover suffered a left groin strain during last night's game and has been placed on the IL. Jose Herrera will get the bulk of the starts behind the plate in Moreno's absence.\n\nEarlier today we reported that top catching prospect Adrian Del Castillo was promoted from Triple-A Reno to be the back up catcher behind Herrera. It's hoped Del Castillo's defense will be good enough to allow his potent bat into the lineup more frequently.\n\nThe left-hand batting Del Castillo just arrived this morning and should be available off the bench, and will likely get his first major league start tomorrow.\n\nThe resurgent Corbin Carroll is back atop the lineup. Carroll has a .907 OPS over his last 23 games, including three doubles, four triples, and six homers. MVP candidate Ketel Marte hit his 28th homer in the first inning Monday. It was his fourth homer in three games.\n\nRounding out the top three in the order, Joc Pederson had a huge go-ahead homer for the second game in a row. He's batting .285 with 18 homers and a team best .946 OPS.\n\nThe Guardians organization philosophy is to stack their roster with left-hand batters. That is because 70% of the pitches thrown in MLB are by right-hand pitchers. One might think that makes them vulnerable to lefties but with the exception of Rodriguez last year, that's not really the case.\n\nIn 2024 they have a .797 OPS in games started by a left-hand starter and and .678 in games started by a right hand starter. That is because their right-handed bats tend to crush lefties. None more so than Jose Ramirez. The switch hitter is mashing lefties to the tune of .366/.401/.719. 1.119 OPS and 11 homers.\n\nBrothers Josh and Bo Naylor are two Left hand batters in their lineup who do tend to be neutralized by left hand pitching however. Josh Naylor has hit .219/.310/.421 against lefties, while Bo has hit .170/.222./.322.\n\nBoth bullpens have been worked heavily of late, and extra innings last night helped neither side in that regard. With Rodriguez on a pitch count of about 75-80 pitches, it could be very difficult for Arizona if he has a short outing. Long reliever Humberto Castellanos was optioned to make room on the roster. Slade Cecconi threw 56 pitches on Saturday.\n\nExpect Justin Martinez, Ryan Thompson, and A.J.

When Randal Grichuk smashed a 105 mph rocket off the side of Allen's head, it looked like his return to the big leagues after a month at Triple-A Columbus was over practically before it began.\n\nBut things got better for Allen from there.\n\nHe issued back-to-back walks to Jake McCarthy and Eugenio Suarez to load the bases, but got Kevin Newman to pop out to left field. After regrouping in the dugout, Allen returned to the mound for the second inning and went on to retire 13 of the next 14 Arizona hitters he faced, finishing his outing by setting down the final 10 in a row. He struck out a pair and allowed just one hit over his final four frames, and his effort kept Cleveland in the contest against Diamondbacks ace Zac Gallen.\n\nManager Stephen Vogt said after the first inning, Allen did a remarkable job of settling in and attacking Arizona hitters.\n\n\"I thought he was outstanding,\" Vogt said. \"A couple homers to start the game and he could have gotten shaken up, but he came back and made some really good pitches and takes the line drive and man, what a tough guy. We've seen that a couple times now.\"\n\nAllen said he has been hit a few times this season, but this was the scariest. He took a knee for a moment and gathered himself, and once he realized he was OK, he got to his feet and tried to communicate that to teammates, trainers and coaches.\n\n\"Stood up, Nayls (Bo Naylor) was right there, obviously, making sure I was good,\" Allen said. \"All things considered, I'm thankful. It got me, I guess in a good spot. Thankful to have made it through and been able to make it out.\"\n\nBo Naylor said once he realized Allen was going to be OK, there was no doubt in his mind that he would go on to give Cleveland his best for the rest of the outing.\n\n\"Knowing Logan, he's a mental warrior,\" Naylor said. \"He's a good guy who can kind of get himself back to earth and understand the things that he needs to do, and try to have as little thoughts as possible. He did a really good job after that first inning to get back to the identity he's created for himself and just to continue to go out there and compete.\"\n\nAllen said after the first inning, he settled in by attacking Arizona hitters and being more efficient.\n\n\"Just trusting my stuff in zone, not trying to nibble too much, just going right after guys and making them earn it,\" Allen said. \"I had my fair share of getting deep in counts, so just trying to do my best to go right after guys and make them earn their way on swinging the bat instead of free passes.\"\n\nNaylor said Allen commanded the strike zone from the second inning on.\n\n\"He had conviction with everything he threw and he was aggressive in the zone,\" Naylor said. \"He expanded what he needed to expand and just kind of played that push-pull game, which is really good.\"\n\nCobb, acquired by Cleveland at last week's trade deadline from San Francisco, could be in line to start one of the doubleheader games Friday in Minnesota. Boyd, signed last month with a goal of pitching in August after recovering from Tommy John surgery, could be in the rotation as early as next week. Where that leaves Allen remains to be seen, but the lefty said Monday he is just happy to be back in the majors after a month away from his teammates.\n\n\"I guess when I'm there in Triple-A, I'd rather be up here, even if it's taking balls off the head and giving up homers,\" Allen said. \"But just giving the team a chance to win is all I'm trying to do, so I was happy to do that.\"",

He was expected to fill a major void in the club's starting rotation before feeling discomfort in his shoulder during a spring training game in March.\n\nHe only expected to miss a few weeks, but wound up having an early setback in rehab and being sidelined for five months.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: C Gabriel Moreno (strained left adductor) was placed on the 10-day injured list after getting hurt while running to first in Monday's game. Moreno returned to Phoenix to be checked by the team's medical staff. Rookie Adrian Del Castillo was recalled from Triple-A Reno to take his spot.\n\nGuardians: RHP Tanner Bibee (shoulder tightness) threw a bullpen session and then met with pitching coach Carl Willis and head trainer Lonnie Soloff.

The Guardians were scheduled to start right-hander Ben Lively.\n\nNow, Lively (10-6, 3.42 ERA) will pitch the first game of the doubleheader against Arizona right-hander Brandon Pfaadt (5-6, 3.97), and in Game 2, Rodriguez will debut against Cleveland righty Carlos Carrasco (3-9, 5.53).\n\nThe Guardians entered Tuesday with the best record in baseball, while the D-backs won the series opener 7-6 in 10 innings on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Carrasco_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Carrasco (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://lineup-publishing.s3.amazonaws.com/23930455.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792030", "eventUri": "eng-9792030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 460689587, "relevance": 2}

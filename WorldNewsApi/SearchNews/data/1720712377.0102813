The national side will touch down in Bavaria before heading for the picturesque town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The base-camp for Scotland\u2019s Euro hopes lies at the foot of Germany\u2019s highest mountain the Zugspitze and opposite peak of Mount Wank. Steve Clark's men will train together before facing off against the hosts in Munich on Friday night. The gaffer named his final 26 man squad earlier in the week, and at around 1pm on Sunday their social media team posted a picture of the group all smiles as they boarded the flight. In a post on X, formally Twitter, they said: \"We're off to Germany.\" Scotland fans were quick to wish the boys the best of luck in the comments. Among the dozens of well-wishers was SNP MSP for Greenock & Inverclyde Stuart McMillan who said: \"Go on boys.\" Meanwhile supporter Gavin Brophy said: \"Don\u2019t come home too soon!\" Andrew Hamilton said: \"Good luck lads.\" Tony Swanson added: \"Get in there lads, enjoy, do your best and make us proud of your performance.\" And Mary Jackson said: \"Come on you Bonny Bonny Boys!\" Scotland head into the tournament having squandered a two-goal lead to draw with Finland at Hampden Park in the final warm-up match on Friday after ending a seven-game winless run against Gibraltar on Monday night. The team will take on Germany in the opening match of the tournament before taking on Switzerland and Hungary in the next two games. The Tartan Army are expected to head for Munich in their thousands over the next two weeks. We are preparing for our second consecutive European Championships and looking to make it out of a major international tournament group stage for the first time in our history. The national team returned to the Euros for the 2020 edition \u2014 played in 2021 \u2014 after an absence dating back to 1996, but endured a tough campaign with just a single point from three games, although that did come in a draw with England at Wembley. However, it means that across 11 major tournament appearances, Scotland have won just six of their 33 games and never made it to the knockout rounds. That said, Spain found out during qualifying how Steve Clarke\u2019s men can provide a shock, so we won\u2019t be written off.

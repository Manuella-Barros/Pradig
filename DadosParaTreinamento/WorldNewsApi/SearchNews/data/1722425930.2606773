{"id": 243247408, "title": "Rick O\u2019Shea: Want the best books for men? Look beyond the stereotypes", "text": "I\u2019ve been told before that I don\u2019t read like a \u201cnormal\u201d man. I\u2019m happy with that, to be honest. I\u2019ve spent a lifetime trying not to be a stereotype. There is a perception, rightly or wrongly, that a lot of men, when they can be bothered to read, are simple creatures. Give them spies, certain thrillers, biographies of \u201creal\u201d, \u201cgreat\u201d men (bonus points if the subject started a war or won one at some point), biographies of sportsmen, something with Jeremy Clarkson on the cover. As a man, the stereotype says you can read fiction, but it will probably be written by someone male, dead and white. Looking through the Instagram feeds of certain publishers in the run-up to Father\u2019s Day, this stereotype lives on, even in 2024. It says your dad wants all of the above, maybe with the odd outdoorsy book thrown in where men learn to survive in the wild, books on politics (nothing too progressive, obviously) and, certainly from our friends across the water, endless giant tomes on World War II. Doubt me? Go to Amazon and type in \u201cbooks for men\u201d. See what comes up.", "summary": "<p>I\u2019ve been told before that I don\u2019t read like a \u201cnormal\u201d man.

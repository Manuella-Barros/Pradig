Netanyahu criticized the IDF last week for holding tactical pauses along a major road in Gaza so that humanitarian aid could be delivered to the region. The IDF's leadership believes that Hamas can only be defeated entirely if Israel appoints a new governing body to oversee Gaza, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAfter almost a year of conflict, the IDF has seen Hamas resurge in regions of Gaza that the military previously seized, per the WSJ. Hamas retains between 9,000 and 12,000 operatives -- down from roughly 30,000 -- who are scattered throughout Gaza, primarily in Rafah, the southernmost region of the enclave, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nNegotiations for a ceasefire have been largely unsuccessful. Israel and international mediators, including the U.S., have presented several proposals to Hamas, almost all of which have been rejected. President Joe Biden's most recent proposal was also turned down by the terrorist group, and the Biden administration is reportedly fearful that no ceasefire deal will be reached anytime soon.\n\nThe IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Council on Foreign Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666305", "eventUri": "eng-9666305", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 163, "textEnd": 169}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office appeared to reject Hagari's comments, stating on Wednesday night that the country was still fully \"committed\" to destroying Hamas.\n\n\"The security cabinet headed by Prime Minister Netanyahu defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities as one of the goals of the war,\" Netnayahu's office said on Wednesday. \"The IDF is of course committed to this.\"\n\nThe IDF said in response that Hagari was talking about \"the elimination of Hamas as an idea and ideology,\" and the notion that he was speaking otherwise would be \"taking the quote out of context,\" according to the Times.\n\nThe incident underscores the growing rift between Israeli forces and the country's government. Netanyahu criticized the IDF last week for holding tactical pauses along a major road in Gaza so that humanitarian aid could be delivered to the region. The IDF's leadership believes that Hamas can only be defeated entirely if Israel appoints a new governing body to oversee Gaza, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAfter almost a year of conflict, the IDF has seen Hamas resurge in regions of Gaza that the military previously seized, per the WSJ. Hamas retains between 9,000 and 12,000 operatives -- down from roughly 30,000 -- who are scattered throughout Gaza, primarily in Rafah, the southernmost region of the enclave, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nNegotiations for a ceasefire have been largely unsuccessful. Israel and international mediators, including the U.S., have presented several proposals to Hamas, almost all of which have been rejected. President Joe Biden's most recent proposal was also turned down by the terrorist group, and the Biden administration is reportedly fearful that no ceasefire deal will be reached anytime soon.\n\nThe IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

It's rooted in the hearts of the people. Whoever thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.\"\n\n\"What we can do is grow something different, something to replace it. The politicians will decide\" who will replace Hamas, Hagari said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office appeared to reject Hagari's comments, stating on Wednesday night that the country was still fully \"committed\" to destroying Hamas.\n\n\"The security cabinet headed by Prime Minister Netanyahu defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities as one of the goals of the war,\" Netnayahu's office said on Wednesday. \"The IDF is of course committed to this.\"\n\nThe IDF said in response that Hagari was talking about \"the elimination of Hamas as an idea and ideology,\" and the notion that he was speaking otherwise would be \"taking the quote out of context,\" according to the Times.\n\nThe incident underscores the growing rift between Israeli forces and the country's government. Netanyahu criticized the IDF last week for holding tactical pauses along a major road in Gaza so that humanitarian aid could be delivered to the region. The IDF's leadership believes that Hamas can only be defeated entirely if Israel appoints a new governing body to oversee Gaza, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAfter almost a year of conflict, the IDF has seen Hamas resurge in regions of Gaza that the military previously seized, per the WSJ. Hamas retains between 9,000 and 12,000 operatives -- down from roughly 30,000 -- who are scattered throughout Gaza, primarily in Rafah, the southernmost region of the enclave, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nNegotiations for a ceasefire have been largely unsuccessful. Israel and international mediators, including the U.S., have presented several proposals to Hamas, almost all of which have been rejected. President Joe Biden's most recent proposal was also turned down by the terrorist group, and the Biden administration is reportedly fearful that no ceasefire deal will be reached anytime soon.\n\nThe IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Daniel Hagari, pictured here in October 2023, questioned whether the Israeli government's war aims can be achieved.\n\nIsrael's top military spokesman has said Hamas cannot be made to \"disappear,\" casting doubt about whether the government's war aim of defeating the militant group can be achieved and drawing a sharp rebuke from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"The idea that it is possible to destroy Hamas, to make Hamas vanish -- that is throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\" Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Read Adm. Daniel Hagari said Wednesday in an interview with Israel's Channel 13.\n\nHagari's comments prompted a terse response from Netanyahu's office, which said Israel's security cabinet \"has defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities\" as one of the aims of its war in Gaza.\n\n\"The IDF, of course, is committed to this,\" Netanyahu's office said.\n\nThe IDF later sought to clarify Hagari's remarks, confirming it is committed to the government's war goals and claiming that Hagari was only referring to Hamas \"as an ideology and as an idea.\"\n\nDespite the IDF's attempt to soften Hagari's remarks, cracks appear to be deepening between the Israeli government and its military. Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from members of his government and Israel's allies, including the United States, to devise a strategy for the post-war governance of Gaza after Israel's devastating bombardment of the isolated enclave.\n\nIn response to Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel, when militants killed more than 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage, Israel launched its war in Gaza with the primary goals of recovering the hostages, destroying Hamas' ability to govern there and ensuring another attack could not be launched from the Palestinian territory.\n\nBut after eight months of war, and with the prospect of many more to come, Hagari's comments echoed the growing fears that Israel's military campaign may be unable to achieve those aims and that the group could remain a potent ideological force, despite Netanyahu's claim to have killed more than 14,000 Hamas fighters. CNN cannot independently verify that figure.\n\nPalestinians inspect damage after an Israeli strike on the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, June 9, 2024.\n\nEyad Baba/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"Telling the public that there will be no terror in Gaza, no military operatives, no rockets and no armed men is a lie,\" Hagari said in a separate interview with CNN affiliate Kan 11.\n\n\"There will be terror in Gaza. Hamas is an idea, deeply rooted in the hearts of the residents of Gaza. To replace those who handle civil services and distribute or steal food, something else needs to be established. This is a decision for the political echelon, and the army will implement it.\"\n\nIn a sign that Israel's cabinet may be tempering its initial war aims of destroying Hamas in its entirety, government spokesperson David Mencer said that eliminating Hamas' \"military and government capabilities\" does not \"necessarily mean\" killing every member of the group.\n\nMencer told reporters Thursday that Hagari's comments had not harmed the war effort, but stressed it was the military's responsibility to carry out \"the will of the elected government.\"\n\nDuring discussions about the US-backed ceasefire plan, Netanayhu also appeared to have retreated from his maximalist rhetoric at the war's outset. A statement issued last week - reportedly from the Prime Minister's office - said Israel will not end the war \"before achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn't pose a threat to Israel in the future.\"\n\nThe statement did not reference Netanyahu's oft-repeated promise of total victory, nor the elimination of Hamas in full.\n\nNetanyahu attends the state memorial ceremony for the Altalena martyrs in Givatayim, Israel, June 18, 2024.\n\nShaul Golan/Pool/Reuters\n\nHagari's comments sparked the latest in a growing series of public disagreements between Israel's government and military. Last weekend, the IDF announced a daily \"tactical pause\" of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed - a decision that rankled Netanyahu, an Israeli official told CNN.\n\nNetanyahu contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable, but later backed down after being assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, according to the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe IDF's decision to implement tactical pauses also drew fierce criticism from the increasingly rancorous far-right wing of Netanyahu's coalition. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said whoever made the decision \"is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position.\"\n\nAn IDF spokesperson later told CNN the decision for the \"tactical pause\" was approved by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nWhile Israel has had some success in returning those abducted on October 7 - both through a ceasefire-for-hostage deal in November and a daring rescue operation to retrieve four people earlier this month - hope that Israel will be able to return the hostages may also be dwindling.\n\nA senior Hamas official told CNN he has \"no idea\" how many of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza are still alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\n\nCNN's Caitlin Danaher, Eugenia Yosef and Benjamin Brown contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The central stated goal of the war in Gaza -- to destroy Hamas -- was not possible and to maintain it was meant \"throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.\n\n\"Hamas is an idea. Anyone who thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong,\" Hagari said during an interview with Israeli broadcaster Channel 13. \"The political echelon needs to find an alternative -- or it will remain,\" he said, referring to the Palestinian militant group.\n\nNetanyahu's office quickly rebuffed the comments, saying \"the political and security cabinet headed by Prime Minister Netanyahu defined as one of the goals of the war the destruction of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities.\"\n\n\"The IDF is of course committed to this,\" it said.\n\nThe IDF signaled its agreement, saying it was acting to achieve Israel's war goals \"tirelessly\" and \"will keep doing so.\" Hagari, it said in a statement, \"addressed in his interview the elimination of Hamas as an idea and ideology, which was stated explicitly and clearly. Any other claim is taking the quote out of context.\"\n\nHamas welcomed Hagari's comments as an \"admission\" of defeat.\n\nKobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, said he was not convinced Hagari meant to directly disparage Israel's military strategy, but said he could see how his comments would be taken that way.\n\n\"He was trying to say the truth,\" Michael, who is also a member of the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy, told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday. But he said he believed Netanyahu understood that truth -- and that Israel's goal was ultimately to prevent Hamas from being able to regroup and maintain power in Gaza.\n\nStill, Hagari's comments reflected a growing push for Netanyahu to present an actionable plan for the day after the war in Gaza.\n\n\"If we don't bring something else to Gaza, then at the end of the day we will get Hamas,\" Michael warned.\n\nThe absence of a postwar plan for Gaza was at the heart of Gantz' reasoning for quitting Netanyahu's war Cabinet and has also driven criticism from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nThe remarks came as Israeli forces pushed deeper into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, continuing a monthslong assault that local officials say has killed more than 37,000 people.\n\nNetanyahu has faced global criticism over the war's toll on Palestinian civilians and domestic pressure to agree to a cease-fire deal that would secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. In recent weeks he has also faced criticism for his approach to the exchanges taking place across Israel's northern border with Lebanon.\n\nThe IDF said Tuesday that plans for a new offensive in the north were approved and the leader of Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, responded Wednesday saying the \"enemy must expect us to come for them from land, air and sea.\"\n\nThe U.S. sent an envoy to the region in a bid to prevent all-out war in Lebanon, but Netanyahu also sparked dismay in Washington after accusing Israel's chief ally of \"withholding weapons and ammunition.\"\n\nSince Israel launched its campaign in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, in which Israeli officials say some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, military experts have warned that the goal of eliminating Hamas was folly.\n\nThe Biden administration has offered the same evaluation, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning last month that Israel would not be able to fully eliminate Hamas' presence in Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations has warned that thousands of children face possible malnutrition in the enclave, even as the IDF announced brief pauses in fighting to allow for the flow of humanitarian aid.\n\nA U.S.-built floating pier installed along Gaza's coast to help facilitate the delivery of aid was re-anchored to the beach in Gaza on Wednesday, a senior defense official told NBC News.\n\nThe official said the U.S. military hopes to have humanitarian aid flowing again soon after it was temporarily taken out of service due to damage and then high seas.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score":

The statement comes amid a growing rift between the Israeli leader and the military.\n\nIn remarks to Israel's Channel 13 News on Wednesday, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, explained that the PM's stated objective in Gaza is an insult to the Israeli people. \"This business of destroying Hamas, making Hamas disappear - it's simply throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\" he said. \"Hamas is an idea, Hamas is a party. It's rooted in the hearts of the people - whoever thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.\"\n\nThe statement from Hagari reflects assessments from US intelligence and military officials that destroying Hamas is not something that can be accomplished. The US intelligence community's threat assessment released in March said that Israel would likely be fighting Hamas for years to come.\n\nNetanyahu's office responded to Hagari's remarks by saying the prime minister's ends in Gaza remain unchanged. Netanyahu \"has defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities as one of the goals of the war. The Israeli military, of course, is committed to this,\" the statement said.\n\nIt is not the only time Netanyahu has clashed with members of his military in recent days. On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced a limited pause to operations in a select area of Rafah during daylight hours to allow more aid to reach the Palestinians. Netanyahu quickly denounced the move as \"unacceptable.\"\n\nOther divides have emerged within the Israeli government. Last week, former IDF general Benny Gantz withdrew from the war cabinet over Netanyahu's refusal to work out a hostage release agreement. Gantz's exit led Netanyahu to dissolve the war cabinet entirely.\n\nAnother source of friction is a potential law that would remove the Israeli orthodox community's exemption from mandatory military service. The controversial measure is becoming an issue for Netanyahu, who demanded his political partners \"get a grip\" and abandon \"petty politics.\"\n\n\"We are at war on several fronts, and we face great challenges and difficult decisions,\" he added. \"We must all focus solely on the tasks before us: defeating Hamas, returning all our hostages and returning our residents safely to their homes, both in the north and in the south.\"\n\nIsrael is waging a tit-for-tat war with Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as its operations in Gaza and the West Bank, which are expected to last at least five more weeks. US officials are concerned that Tel Aviv will start a wider war with Hezbollah that will grow to include Washington. Some analysts believe that Netanyahu sees Tel Aviv remaining in a state of war as the key to his political survival, as he faces intense public scrutiny over the ongoing war, the failure to prevent Hamas' surprise attack last year, and multiple corruption scandals, among other controversies.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Gantz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benny Gantz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666305", "eventUri": "eng-9666305", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

AFP\n\nIsrael's top army spokesman said on Wednesday that Hamas cannot be eliminated, prompting a knee-jerk reaction from the government which quickly reiterated it remains committed to the Palestinian militant group's destruction.\n\nMore than eight months of war, sparked by the unprecedented Hamas October 7 attack on Israel, have failed to oust the Islamist militants from Gaza but have brought widespread devastation.\n\n\"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas,\" Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told Israel's Channel 13 broadcaster.\n\n\"Hamas is an ideology, we cannot eliminate an ideology.\"\n\nHis comments were quickly rebuffed by the office of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, whose cabinet has stated its Gaza offensive will not end until Hamas is defeated.\n\n\"The political and security cabinet headed by Prime Minister Netanyahu defined as one of the goals of the war the destruction of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities,\" his office said in a statement.\n\n\"The IDF is of course committed to this.\"\n\nIn a separate statement on its Telegram channel, the military clarified that Hagari had addressed Hamas \"as an ideology ... and his statements were clear and explicit\".\n\n\"Any other claim is taking the statement out of context.\"\n\nThe October 7 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas has killed at least 37,396 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nHagari's statement and ensuing reactions from the government constituted a rare public display of the rift between the country's political and military leadership.\n\nWith the war now in its ninth month, frustration has been mounting in Israel with no clear end nor postwar plan in sight.\n\nThere have already been open signs of discontent over the handling of the war by Netanyahu's government. Months of internationally-mediated truce talks, including a proposal floated this month by President Joe Biden, have stalled.\n\nBenny Gantz, a former military chief and centrist politician, withdrew from Netanyahu's war cabinet earlier this month, citing frustration over the prime minister's conduct of the war.\n\nAnd early this week, Netanyahu expressed displeasure with the army's decision to declare a \"tactical pause\" in the southern Gaza city of Rafah to help deliver humanitarian aid to the besieged territory. An aide said Netanyahu was caught off guard by the announcement, and Israeli TV stations quoted him as saying \"we have a country with an army, not an army with a country.\"\n\nIsrael's war effort initially enjoyed broad public support, but in recent months wide divisions have emerged. While Netanyahu has pledged \"total victory,\" a growing array of critics and protesters has backed a cease-fire that would bring home the hostages.\n\nIn recent weeks, Israel's military has concentrated its offensive in the nearby city of Rafah, which lies on the border with Egypt and where it says the last Hamas remnants are holding out.\n\nMore than half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people had earlier taken shelter in Rafah to escape fighting elsewhere in the territory, and the city is now nearly empty as the Israeli military carries out air strikes and ground operations.\n\nIsrael also has taken over a 14-kilometre corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, including the Rafah border crossing. Footage circulating on social media shows the crossing blackened and destroyed, with only the former passenger terminal remaining intact. Before Israel moved into the area, the crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid and to allow Palestinians to leave the territory.", "source": {"uri": "thearabweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Gantz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benny Gantz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image_800x450_/public/2024-06/2024-06-20_07-50-51_929824.jpg?itok=5Nl40fdM", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666305", "eventUri": "eng-9666305", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 390, "textEnd": 399, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The Israeli military, of course, is committed to this.\"\n\nThe military quickly issued a clarification, saying it was \"committed to achieving the goals of the war as defined by the cabinet\" and that it has been working on this \"throughout the war, day and night, and will continue to do so\".\n\nHagari's comments, it said, \"referred to the destruction of Hamas as an ideology and an idea,

undermined Netanyahu's \"doctrine\" that Hamas could be defeated \"once and for all\".\n\n\"Right now, it seems that for the first time after many years, there is an ongoing escalation between the government headed by Netanyahu and his entourage of reporters, analysts who are actually on his - unofficially - on his team, that are smearing the chief of staff,\" Eldar told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"It's a kind of apocalyptic scenario that the army spokesman - who is reporting to the chief of staff - is just undermining Netanyahu's doctrine, which is: We do have to put an end to the Hamas government once and for all in Gaza,\" Eldar said.\n\n\"What Hagari is saying is challenging Netanyahu and saying, actually ... you are hallucinating.\"\n\nThere have already been open signs of discontent over the handling of the war by Netanyahu's government, a coalition that includes right-wing hardliners who oppose any kind of settlement with Hamas.\n\nMonths of internationally mediated ceasefire talks, including a proposal floated this month by US President Joe Biden, have stalled.\n\nBenny Gantz, a former military chief and centrist politician, withdrew from Netanyahu's war cabinet earlier this month, citing frustration over the prime minister's conduct of the war.\n\nAnd Netanyahu this week expressed displeasure with the army's decision to declare a \"tactical pause\" in the southern Gaza city of Rafah to help deliver humanitarian aid.\n\nAn aide said Netanyahu was caught off guard by the announcement, and Israeli TV stations quoted him as saying, \"We have a country with an army, not

Daniel Hagari said Wednesday in an interview with Israel's Channel 13.\n\nHagari's comments prompted a terse response from Netanyahu's office, which said Israel's security cabinet \"has defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities\" as one of the aims of its war in Gaza.\n\n\"The IDF, of course, is committed to this,\" Netanyahu's office said.\n\nThe IDF later sought to clarify Hagari's remarks, confirming it is committed to the government's war goals and claiming that Hagari was only referring to Hamas \"as an ideology and as an idea.\"\n\nDespite the IDF's attempt to soften Hagari's remarks, cracks appear to be deepening between the Israeli government and its military. Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from members of his government and Israel's allies, including the United States, to devise a strategy for the post-war governance of Gaza after Israel's devastating bombardment of the isolated enclave.\n\nIn response to Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel, when militants killed more than 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage, Israel launched its war in Gaza with the primary goals of recovering the hostages, destroying Hamas' ability to govern there and ensuring another attack could not be launched from the Palestinian territory.\n\nBut after eight months of war, and with the prospect of many more to come, Hagari's comments echoed the growing fears that Israel's military campaign may be unable to achieve those aims and that the group could remain a potent ideological force, despite Netanyahu's claim to have killed more than 14,000 Hamas fighters. CNN cannot independently verify that figure.\n\n\"Telling the public that there will be no terror in Gaza, no military operatives, no rockets and no armed men is a lie,\" Hagari said in a separate interview with CNN affiliate Kan 11.\n\n\"There will be terror in Gaza. Hamas is an idea, deeply rooted in the hearts of the residents of Gaza. To replace those who handle civil services and distribute or steal food, something else needs to be established. This is a decision for the political echelon, and the army will implement it.\"\n\nIn a sign that Israel's cabinet may be tempering its initial war aims of destroying Hamas in its entirety, government spokesperson David Mencer said that eliminating Hamas' \"military and government capabilities\" does not \"necessarily mean\" killing every member of the group.\n\nMencer told reporters Thursday that Hagari's comments had not harmed the war effort, but stressed it was the military's responsibility to carry out \"the will of the elected government.\"\n\nDuring discussions about the US-backed ceasefire plan, Netanayhu also appeared to have retreated from his maximalist rhetoric at the war's outset. A statement issued last week - reportedly from the Prime Minister's office - said Israel will not end the war \"before achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn't pose a threat to Israel in the future.\"\n\nThe statement did not reference Netanyahu's oft-repeated promise of total victory, nor the elimination of Hamas in full.\n\nHagari's comments sparked the latest in a growing series of public disagreements between Israel's government and military. Last weekend, the IDF announced a daily \"tactical pause\" of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed - a decision that rankled Netanyahu, an Israeli official told CNN.\n\nNetanyahu contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable, but later backed down after being assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, according to the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe IDF's decision to implement tactical pauses also drew fierce criticism from the increasingly rancorous far-right wing of Netanyahu's coalition. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said whoever made the decision \"is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position.\"\n\nAn IDF spokesperson later told CNN the decision for the \"tactical pause\" was approved by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nWhile Israel has had some success in returning those abducted on October 7 - both through a ceasefire-for-hostage deal in November and a daring rescue operation to retrieve four people earlier this month - hope that Israel will be able to return the hostages may also be dwindling.\n\nA senior Hamas official told CNN he has \"no idea\" how many of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza are still alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Something that will make the population realise that someone else is distributing the food, someone else is taking care of public services... to really weaken Hamas, this is the way,\" Hagari said.\n\nHe added that returning all captives through military operations was \"impossible\" and that this would have to be achieved through other means.\n\nHagari's comments came amid ever-growing tensions between Netanyahu and military officials over the prime minister's handling of the war on Gaza, as a week of anti-government protests demanding a deal to secure the release of captives continues across Israel.\n\nLast month, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant publicly called out Netanyahu for not having a clear plan for \"post-war governance\" in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHe said he did not support open-ended Israeli military rule over the Palestinian territory and urged the prime minister to present a local alternative, an option Netanyahu has so far avoided.\n\nLast weeek, the Israeli military's chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, was reportedly behind media leaks criticising the government for a lack of political solutions to end the war.\n\nNetanyahu rebuffed pressure from the military, taking a jab at the leaks by saying: \"Israel is a state with an army, not an army with a state\".\n\nEarlier this month, former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz resigned over the absence of a \"post-war\" plan for Gaza. His announcement followed an ultimatum he handed to Netanyahu last month calling on him to lay out a new plan for the war on Gaza by 8 June.\n\nHis decision was applauded by Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid, who called the move \"important and correct\".\n\nFormer top general and war cabinet minister Gadi Eisenkot, an ally of Gantz, said earlier this month that \"anyone promising that 'we'll deal with the battalions in Rafah and then bring back the hostages' is sowing a baseless illusion.\"\n\nA recent poll by the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) revealed that only 12 percent of Israelis believe the government would achieve its military goals in Gaza, while 67 percent said they would defeat Hezbollah, down from 91 percent immediately after the outbreak of the war on 7 October.\n\nThe United States has repeatedly called on Netanyahu to present a post-war plan for Gaza. Last month, US President Joe Biden said that there was \"every reason\" for people to believe Netanyahu was prolonging the conflict for political reasons.", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net",

It is rooted in the hearts of the people -- whoever thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong,\" said the IDF officer.\n\nHagari said that the way to weaken Hamas is to establish a new government in the Gaza Strip that would replace it and take care of food distribution and public services, adding that the only way to secure the release of all Israeli hostages is by reaching a swap deal.\n\nIn response, Netanyahu's office released a statement saying that the security cabinet \"has defined as one of the war goals the destruction of Hamas's military and governance capabilities,\" indicating a slight shift from the previously stated objective of eliminating Hamas.\n\nIsraeli forces have been fighting in Gaza for more than eight months, causing a humanitarian crisis and mass destruction and killing more than 37,300 people, mainly civilians. According to the Israeli army, much of Hamas' militant infrastructure has been dismantled.\n\nIsrael launched the war to retaliate for a surprise Hamas attack on southern Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people.\n\nIsrael's Home Front Command has announced the lifting of security restrictions in numerous communities near the Gaza Strip, marking a significant easing of measures since Hamas' attack on October 7, 2023.\n\nThe new guidelines, applicable to the \"Gaza Envelope\" area extending up to 7 km from the Gaza border, exclude 25 communities, such as Sderot and Kerem Shalom, situated closer to the border.\n\nAccording to a statement from the military, the decision follows a comprehensive assessment by Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi.\n\nUnder these revised directives, outdoor educational activities can resume without constraints, gatherings of up to 1,000 people are permitted, and workplaces and essential economic activities can proceed unrestricted.\n\nThe adjustments in the Home Front Command's defensive protocols are aimed at easing restrictions on civilian life by the current operational assessment to help revitalise agriculture, economy, and education, said the military in a statement.\n\nThe move comes after an eight-and-a-half-month conflict between Israel and Hamas, during which Israeli operations resulted in extensive infrastructure damage and loss of life in Gaza, primarily among civilians.\n\nIsraeli authorities assert significant dismantling of Hamas' militant infrastructure during the conflict. Israel initiated the military campaign in response to a surprise attack by Hamas on southern Israeli communities, resulting in casualties numbering around 1,200 individuals.\n\nMeanwhile, Netanyahu on Wednesday issued a statement made to his coalition partners, telling them to \"get a hold of themselves.\" The statement came after coalition partners complained about laws that were arranged to be passed in the coalition agreement were shelved.\n\n\"We are fighting on several fronts and face great challenges and difficult decisions,\" said Netanyahu. \"Therefore, I demand that all coalition partners get a hold of themselves and rise to the importance of the hour.\"\n\n\"This is not the time for petty politics or for legislation that endangers the coalition, which is fighting for victory over our enemies,\" he added. \"We must all focus solely on the tasks at hand: Defeating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and returning our residents securely to their homes, both in the north and the south.\"\n\nNetanyahu went on to demand that all of his 64 coalition members (out of 120) in the Knesset \"put aside every other consideration. Put aside all extraneous interests. Line up, as one, together, behind our fighters.\"", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local News for British Asian and Indian Community in London"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Front_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Front Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzi_Halevi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herzi Halevi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(military)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staff (military)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sderot", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sderot"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sderot"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://asianlite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/White-House-cancels-US-Israel-meeting.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666305", "eventUri": "eng-9666305", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Any other claim is taking the quote out of context.\"\n\nHamas welcomed Hagari's comments as an \"admission\" of defeat.\n\nKobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, said he was not convinced Hagari meant to directly disparage Israel's military strategy, but said he could see how his comments would be taken that way.\n\n\"He was trying to say the truth,\" Michael, who is also a member of the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy, told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday. But he said he believed Netanyahu understood that truth -- and that Israel's goal was ultimately to prevent Hamas from being able to regroup and maintain power in Gaza.\n\nStill, Hagari's comments reflected a growing push for Netanyahu to present an actionable plan for the day after the war in Gaza.\n\n\"If we don't bring something else to Gaza, then at the end of the day we will get Hamas,\" Michael warned.\n\nThe absence of a postwar plan for Gaza was at the heart of Gantz' reasoning for quitting Netanyahu's war Cabinet and has also driven criticism from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nThe remarks came as Israeli forces pushed deeper into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, continuing a monthslong assault that local officials say has killed more than 37,000 people.\n\nNetanyahu has faced global criticism over the war's toll on Palestinian civilians and domestic pressure to agree to a cease-fire deal that would secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. In recent weeks he has also faced criticism for his approach to the exchanges taking place across Israel's northern border with Lebanon.\n\nThe IDF said Tuesday that plans for a new offensive in the north were approved and the leader of Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, responded Wednesday saying the \"enemy must expect us to come for them from land, air and sea.\"\n\nThe U.S. sent an envoy to the region in a bid to prevent all-out war in Lebanon, but Netanyahu also sparked dismay in Washington after accusing Israel's chief ally of \"withholding weapons and ammunition.\"\n\nSince Israel launched its campaign in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, in which Israeli officials say some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, military experts have warned that the goal of eliminating Hamas was folly.\n\nThe Biden administration has offered the same evaluation, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning last month that Israel would not be able to fully eliminate Hamas' presence in Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations has warned that thousands of children face possible malnutrition in the enclave, even as the IDF announced brief pauses in fighting to allow for the flow of humanitarian aid.\n\nA U.S.-built floating pier installed along Gaza's coast to help facilitate the delivery of aid was re-anchored to the beach in Gaza on Wednesday, a senior defense official told NBC News.\n\nThe official said the U.S. military hopes to have humanitarian aid flowing again soon after it was temporarily taken out of service due to damage and then high seas.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5,

It's rooted in the hearts of the people. Whoever thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.\"\n\nHagari's comments drew a rebuke from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who issued a statement saying the security cabinet had \"defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities as one of the goals of the war\".\n\n\"The Israeli military, of course, is committed to this,\" the statement added.\n\nIn response, the military said Hagari had been talking about \"the elimination of Hamas as an idea and ideology\", and that any other interpretation was \"taking the quote out of context\".\n\nThe spat comes amid increasingly public tensions in Israel's leadership over the course of the war in Gaza, where Israel is far from achieving its objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing the roughly 120 hostages still held by the militant group.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu lashed out at the army after it announced a limited pause in operations near a crossing into Gaza that was intended to help aid distribution in the shattered enclave, where aid groups have warned that famine is imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, in recent days, Netanyahu's son Yair has made a number of posts on social media attacking military leaders.\n\nOn Tuesday, he shared a video in which a journalist accused Herzi Halevi, the head of the military, of wanting Hamas to remain in power in Gaza -- which the Israel Defense Forces dismissed as a \"baseless lie\". A day later he posted a tweet asking where Tomer Bar, the head of Israel's air force, had been \"and what was he doing\" during the armed group's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nThe tensions over Israel's military strategy have been accompanied by feuding within Netanyahu's rightwing coalition, with members bickering publicly on Wednesday after a bill on rabbinical appointments was pulled ahead of a vote owing to a lack of support.\n\nThat decision prompted fury among Netanyahu's ultraorthodox coalition partners, with some issuing veiled threats to leave the government. It also sparked a bizarre spat between Netanyahu's Likud party and the extreme-right Jewish Power party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, his coalition partner.\n\nFollowing reports that Netanyahu had offered Ben-Gvir, who is national security minister, access to security briefings reserved for a limited number of ministers if he supported the bill, Likud said that anyone who wanted access to such information would have to \"prove that he is not leaking state secrets or private conversations\".\n\nIn response, Jewish Power called for a bill to subject ministers to lie detector tests, \"provided that it also applies to those with pacemakers\" -- in an apparent reference to Netanyahu, who had a pacemaker fitted last year after being hospitalised with heart problems.\n\nThere were also signs of tensions within Likud, with economy minister Nir Barkat -- widely seen as a future challenger to Netanyahu -- saying he would not support the current version of legislation that critics have said would entrench exemptions from military service for the ultraorthodox.\n\nLikud hit back, accusing Barkat of looking for \"excuses to topple a rightwing government during wartime\". Meanwhile, Netanyahu issued a statement, demanding his coalition partners \"get a hold of themselves\".\n\n\"We are fighting on several fronts and face great challenges and difficult decisions,\" he said. \"This is not the time for petty politics or for legislation that endangers the coalition.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_13_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Channel 13 (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzi_Halevi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herzi Halevi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Likud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otzma_Yehudit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Otzma Yehudit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barkat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nir Barkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Ben-Gvir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haredi Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F963260d8-2255-4982-8db3-759a98bb4239.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666305", "eventUri": "eng-9666305", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2214, "textEnd": 2223}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

We cannot eliminate an ideology. To say that we are going to make it disappear is to throw smoke and fog in the eyes of the public,\" Hagari declared in an interview with Israel's Channel 13 television, in which he concluded in devastating fashion: \"If we don't offer an alternative, in the end we will have Hamas\".\n\nSo brutal did Netanyahu find this questioning that he reacted immediately with a terse but firm statement, reaffirming his intention not to conclude the war until \"the government and military capabilities of Hamas are destroyed\".\n\nThe Hagari controversy follows sharp disagreements between Netanyahu and centrist leader Benny Gantz over the alleged post-war plan for Gaza. The latter's alleged absence was the reason for former General Gantz's resignation from the government's war cabinet, which in turn prompted the Israeli prime minister to dissolve the cabinet. Nor was the disbanding of the cabinet a gratuitous manoeuvre because one of his most extremist ministers, Itamar Ben Gvir, had demanded that Netanyahu join the cabinet, to which the head of government responded with a more than veiled accusation against his security minister, urging him to prove that he is not the \"loudmouth\" who goes around divulging state secrets that significantly damage the government's united action. Ben Gvir replied by asking Netanyahu to have all ministers take a lie detector test to find out who is or are the one or ones who are actually giving free rein to the wet blanket.\n\nIn this undoubtedly tense domestic climate, also fuelled by the families of those kidnapped and still held by Hamas, the leader of the Islamist movement Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has burst in, threatening Israel with all-out war, claiming that he not only has new weapons, but also innovative intelligence capabilities within Israel itself. In apocalyptic fashion, Nasrallah warned that \"no place in Israel would be spared the range of his group's missiles if its leaders carry out their threats to attack Lebanon\".\n\nNasrallah inflamed his followers by pointing out that \"we are prepared for the worst, so the enemy [Israel] must know that we will attack them by land, sea and air\". The Hizbollah leader rounded off his speech by threatening Cyprus directly for the first time, stating that \"we have credible information that Israel would use Cypriot airports and bases\" in its intended offensive on Lebanon. This was in response to Israeli Major General Ori Gordin's statement the previous day that Israel had already approved operational plans to launch an offensive on Lebanon.\n\nIn this context, it is important to highlight the latest geopolitical analysis by Zvi Bar'el, professor at Sapir Academic College and published in Haaretz: \"Israel already has proof that it cannot sustain all the wars it would like to fight, and even those it is forced to fight\", the analyst states categorically. In his opinion, it has been demonstrated that \"it is a balloon that we are prepared for any scenario\", once it has been confirmed that it is impossible to destroy Hamas, to take Lebanon back to the Stone Age and to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities, \"while it is also unable to eliminate the terror [sown by the settlers] in the West Bank\".\n\nThe paper thus considerably undercuts the euphoria about Israel's supposed invincibility, even though this is fundamentally underpinned by unquestioned and unquestioned US military aid. And the conclusion that can be drawn is rather discouraging: the Gaza war is increasingly at risk of spilling over and setting the whole region on fire - and beyond.", "source": {"uri":

But in order to reach a situation in which we really weaken Hamas, that is the path.\"\n\nHagari also appeared to criticize Netanyahu's oft-repeated call for \"absolute victory\" over the Palestinian armed group. \"The idea that it is possible to destroy Hamas, to make Hamas vanish -- that is throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\" he said.\n\nThat prompted a swift rejoinder from Netanyahu's office, which said that the Israeli Cabinet had set \"the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities\" as one of the war's aims, and that the Israeli military was \"of course committed to this.\"\n\nNetanyahu, no stranger to political conflict, is embattled on multiple fronts, feuding publicly with members of his own party, with leaders of other parties in his governing coalition, and with the Biden administration. But the public rift with military leaders is particularly striking amid wartime pressure for unity.\n\n\"There's an enormous lack of trust. The military no longer believes in the political leadership, parts of which no longer believe in the army,\" said Gadi Shamni, a retired Israeli general. \"The Israeli military sees a lack of overall strategy, a growing rift with the United States, and incitement against its commanders.\"\n\nThe far-right members of Netanyahu's Cabinet have insisted that all-out war against Hamas continue, and the prime minister has given no public indication that he is ready to let up. When the military this week instituted a daytime combat pause along a key road corridor to allow more aid distribution in southern Gaza, Netanyahu indicated at first that the change had been made without his knowledge -- though he has not made any move to rescind it, either.\n\nThe Israeli military said Wednesday that it was relaxing some wartime restrictions on Israeli communities near Gaza, and that it was very close to defeating Hamas's forces in Rafah, both suggestions that Israeli commanders see some easing in the fighting.\n\nSince the Oct. 7 attack that Israel says killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages, ample evidence has emerged that Israeli officials knew of Hamas's plans for the operation but did not take them seriously.\n\nHerzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, has said he accepts some responsibility for the failure; Netanyahu has yet to do so unequivocally. The prime minister and his allies have said assigning blame must wait until after the war, while also occasionally blaming the Israeli security establishment.\n\nAnd the Israeli military has backed drafting more ultra-Orthodox soldiers, citing a need for more conscripts to fuel the war effort. But under pressure from his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, Netanyahu has moved to ensure the community's longstanding exemption from military service remains unchanged.\n\nBut the most important concern for the Israeli military, analysts said, is ensuring that hard-won tactical gains against Hamas, which had governed Gaza since 2007, did not go to waste. For that, Hagari said, there had be an alternative to Hamas in Gaza.\n\nFor now, Netanyahu has sought to avoid making a decision on how to govern the enclave after the fighting stops. The United States and other allies have said the Palestinian Authority, which oversees parts of the occupied West Bank, should ultimately take charge in Gaza, while the far-right coalition partners on whom Netanyahu's political survival depends support permanent Israeli rule in Gaza.\n\nAs a result, buffeted between competing pressures, Netanyahu has mostly said no. He has ruled out both a Palestinian Authority administration and new Israeli settlements in Gaza, and has vowed to keep up the assault until Hamas is destroyed. He has said little about who will ultimately take responsibility for the enclave's 2.2 million residents.\n\nShamni said Hagari's remarks seemed aimed at pressuring Netanyahu to take a position. \"You have to decide, tell us what you want,\" Shamni said. \"You don't want the Palestinian Authority, OK. Tell us what you want instead. A military administration? They're not even saying that much.\n\n\"The government as a whole has no stance,\" he added.\n\nYoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, said last month that Netanyahu's inability to make a clear-cut choice was moving Israel inexorably toward two unappealing outcomes: either an Israeli military regime in Gaza or Hamas eventually returning to power.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzi_Halevi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herzi Halevi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haredi Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/XPsKLs_sAl2JY8dq_1q0KAkGrgs=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/YX6MHZYBERWJ6YTZDHR7KD2LS4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666305", "eventUri": "eng-9666305", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2516, "textEnd": 2522}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 456620060, "relevance": 2}

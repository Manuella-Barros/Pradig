The deadly blast on December 3, 2020, resulted in the deaths of Luke Wheaton, Ray White, Brian Vickery and Mike James.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, the Major Crime Investigation Team spearheaded the inquiry into the cause of the explosion, with assistance from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The focus of the investigation was to determine if any individuals or organisations were culpable for the explosion and whether there had been any breaches of health and safety regulations.\n\nThroughout the process, the bereaved families have been kept informed of significant developments. Recently, detectives from the Major Crime Investigation Team and investigators from the HSE met with the Crown Prosecution Service to review the evidence collected.\n\nREAD MORE: Roof torn off UK's 'biggest man cave' as dramatic aerial pictures reveal what's inside\n\nREAD MORE: NHS issue Covid warning to 'call 999' if you or your child has these symptoms\n\nFollowing this review, it was decided that there was insufficient evidence to realistically secure a criminal conviction for manslaughter. While this decision concludes the police-led investigation, the HSE will continue its enquiries to ascertain if there were any violations of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, reports Bristol Live.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Mark Almond said: \"Throughout our inquiry the families of Luke, Ray, Brian and Mike have been firmly in our thoughts. The families have demonstrated great dignity and patience while we carried out our enquiries and I'd like to publicly thank them for their support and understanding over the past three and a half years.\n\n\"Inquiries of this kind are extremely complex and require the support of other agencies to gather evidence and then a variety of experts to help us interpret what that evidence tells us. In this case, the evidence we've gathered doesn't reach the extremely high threshold to prosecute any criminal offence of manslaughter.\n\n\"We have met all the families to explain this development and to inform them of what will happen next, with HSE taking ownership of the investigation.\"\n\nHSE principal inspector Simon Chilcott said: \"We have been a part of this complex inquiry from the outset. Now as the lead agency, we will continue to carry out a robust criminal investigation to establish if there have been any breaches of health and safety law. We are in regular contact with the families, with whom our thoughts remain.\"\n\nPolice added that while the decision marks an end to the police-led investigation, the HSE will continue to carry out enquiries to determine whether criminal offences were committed under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.", "source": {"uri": "gloucestershirelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gloucestershire Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_hawkins@gloucestershirelive.co.uk", "name": "Jamie Hawkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Safety_Executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health and Safety Executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avon_and_Somerset_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avon and Somerset Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_James_(basketball,_born_1975)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike James (basketball, born 1975)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avonmouth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avonmouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Avonmouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Almond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Almond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bristol Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Safety_at_Work_etc._Act_1974", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i2-prod.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article9401174.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_el_glo041220avonmouthexplosionaerial05.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721107", "eventUri": "eng-9721107", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-03", "textStart": 215, "textEnd": 231}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

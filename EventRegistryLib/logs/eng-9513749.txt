Evri selected Blink for the Rugby site based on its reliable, scalable EV equipment and extensive fleet expertise. As carriers look to electrify their fleets, Blink Charging UK provides guidance to help assess Evri's requirements and optimize their infrastructure to meet the needs of a busy charging hub point.\n\nThe charging hub at Rugby is a 24-hour operation, with the chargers expected to be in use 60-80% of the time. Each charger has been strategically placed to be accessible to Evri's hundreds of staff at the center as well as to their fleet vehicles.\n\nThe Eve Single Pro line smart charging solution is a lightweight and durable charger, with a user-friendly interface, enabling one vehicle to charge at up to 22kW. The charger complies with all relevant standards, including IEC 61851:2017 - IEC 61851:2017.\n\nThe purpose-built, automated parcel distribution hub in Rugby, is one of the biggest of its kind in the UK and can process more than one million parcels a day. Installing Blink chargers is part of Evri's plans to improve its charging infrastructure and grow their existing low carbon fleet, which consists of 167 electric vans and growing fleet of e-cargo bikes.\n\n\"This is an exciting opportunity to work with Evri to accelerate the deployment of zero emission delivery services in the UK,\" said Managing Director, Blink Charging UK, Alex Calnan. \"Blink will leverage our turnkey offering covering design, install and management of a scalable charging network, delivering future ready networks to support Evri's ambitious plans. It is a significant milestone as we help one of the UK's biggest dedicated parcel delivery companies take one step closer to reaching their goal of net-zero ambitions.\"\n\nPauline Potter, Director of Procurement and Sustainability at Evri, said, \"we are committed to delivering a sustainable future. This partnership is an important step for Evri on our journey towards net-zero and we are delighted to be working with the team at Blink Charging UK to install EV charging for our Rugby-based vehicles. Together, we can build a more sustainable future for parcel delivery and the communities we serve.\"\n\nBlink Charging UK has more than 2,000 chargers in the United Kingdom and Ireland with customers in sectors including local authorities, NHS trusts, universities, and fleets.

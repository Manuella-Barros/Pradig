The Justice Department will always stand by its state and local law enforcement partners as we work together to counter the threat of terrorism, and that includes being relentless in prosecuting those who seek to harm officers.\"\n\nBickford faced up to 120 years in prison -- 20 years for each charge.\n\nThe government asked for a sentence of at least 50 years in prison, arguing in a court filing ahead of Thursday's sentencing that it \"is necessary and appropriate to reflect the extraordinarily serious nature of the defendant's terrorism offense, to provide just punishment for the defendant's conduct, to deter and prevent the defendant from resuming activities in support of radical terrorist ideology, and to deter others who, like the defendant, would seek to carry out brutal terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.\"\n\nProsecutors said Bickford's \"brutal actions\" had long-lasting impacts on the three officers, who they said believe a sentence of life in prison is appropriate.\n\nThe defense meanwhile sought a 10-year prison sentence followed by 15 years of supervised release. In a court filing ahead of sentencing, they cited his youth at the time of the attack as a key mitigating factor and argued his crimes were \"informed by an unhealthy obsession with Islam\" that stemmed from an untreated mental illness.\n\n\"Mr. Bickford is deeply apologetic to the officers, their families, and the witnesses that night,\" his attorneys wrote. \"He recognizes the pain and suffering he has caused and would do anything to take back what he has done. Although Mr. Bickford knows he cannot change what happened in the past, he knows he can change his future for the better and he has worked hard to do so under challenging circumstances at the [Metropolitan Detention Center].\"\n\nThe three NYPD officers were manning a checkpoint on the Times Square periphery on Dec. 31, 2022, when they were stabbed with an 18-inch kukri knife. The attack occurred near West 52nd Street and Eighth Avenue, outside the secure area that had been set up for New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nBickford was shot by one of the injured officers and arrested following the attack. Law enforcement found Bickford's backpack near the scene of the attack, prosecutors said. A book inside the backpack had a passage highlighted that said, \"Fight in the Name of Allah and in the Cause of Allah. Fight against those who do not believe in Allah. Wage a holy war,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nBickford reportedly told investigators the attack was unsuccessful because none of the officers died and because he did not achieve martyrdom, according to the complaint from the Southern District of New York.\n\nProsecutors said Bickford planned the attack in Times Square after \"months of radicalization\" and had initially intended to travel overseas to support the Taliban before focusing on an attack in the U.S.\n\nBickford also faces more than a dozen state charges in connection with the New Year's Eve attack, including three counts of attempted murder in the first degree in furtherance of an act of terrorism.

He pleaded guilty a year later to five counts involving those charges, which stem from the Dec. 31, 2023, attack on three cops he approached on Eighth Avenue between 51st and 52nd streets.\n\nBickford previously told the judge he was under psychiatric treatment for schizoaffective disorder. During his guilty plea in January, he told the court \"On Dec. 31, 2022, I attempted to kill 3 uniformed NYPD officers in an attack with a knife while they were working. I know what I did was wrong and I'm sorry.\"\n\nAs part of his plea, Bickford admitted he scouted Times Square and chose a group of NYPD officers as his target. He said he carried out the attack to wage jihad, with the goal of killing military aged men so he could become a martyr. Bickford allegedly made statements to detectives implicating himself once in custody.\n\n\"Inspired by radical Islamic extremism, Trevor Bickford brutally attacked three NYPD officers who were just doing their jobs by protecting the public during the Times Square New Year's Eve festivities,\" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said. \"Thankfully, one officer's quick-thinking actions stopped the defendant's attack while minimizing risk to the innocent bystanders who easily might have become additional victims of the defendant's heinous violence.\"\n\nHad the case gone to trial, among the government's evidence were the 12-inch machete used in the attack, a journal found at the scene with Trevor's \"last Will and Testament\" and officers' body camera video that showed the attack. Video showed the machete coming down on the cops, while Bickford's face could also be seen as he swung the weapon.\n\n\"He planned, prepared, and traveled to conduct a savage attack in support of his violent ideology, and now he is being held accountable for his actions,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nAll three officers were treated for their injuries and released from the hospital a day after the incident.

The Justice Department will always stand by its state and local law enforcement partners as we work together to counter the threat of terrorism, and that includes being relentless in prosecuting those who seek to harm officers.\"\n\nBickford faced up to 120 years in prison -- 20 years for each charge.\n\nThe government asked for a sentence of at least 50 years in prison, arguing in a court filing ahead of Thursday's sentencing that it \"is necessary and appropriate to reflect the extraordinarily serious nature of the defendant's terrorism offense, to provide just punishment for the defendant's conduct, to deter and prevent the defendant from resuming activities in support of radical terrorist ideology, and to deter others who, like the defendant, would seek to carry out brutal terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.\"\n\nProsecutors said Bickford's \"brutal actions\" had long-lasting impacts on the three officers, who they said believe a sentence of life in prison is appropriate.\n\nThe defense meanwhile sought a 10-year prison sentence followed by 15 years of supervised release. In a court filing ahead of sentencing, they cited his youth at the time of the attack as a key mitigating factor and argued his crimes were \"informed by an unhealthy obsession with Islam\" that stemmed from an untreated mental illness.\n\n\"Mr. Bickford is deeply apologetic to the officers, their families, and the witnesses that night,\" his attorneys wrote. \"He recognizes the pain and suffering he has caused and would do anything to take back what he has done. Although Mr. Bickford knows he cannot change what happened in the past, he knows he can change his future for the better and he has worked hard to do so under challenging circumstances at the [Metropolitan Detention Center].\"\n\nThe three NYPD officers were manning a checkpoint on the Times Square periphery on Dec. 31, 2022, when they were stabbed with an 18-inch kukri knife. The attack occurred near West 52nd Street and Eighth Avenue, outside the secure area that had been set up for New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nBickford was shot and arrested by officers following the attack. Law enforcement found Bickford's backpack near the scene of the attack, prosecutors said.

Kevin Castel listened to emotional statements from the three police officers who Bickford attacked about two hours before midnight on Dec. 21, 2022, as the officers screened New Year's revelers at the sole entrance to an otherwise closed-off Times Square.\n\nBickford shouted \"Allahu akbar\" - the Arabic phrase for \"God is great\" - before striking the officers in the head with the machete and trying to grab an officer\u00b4s gun. One officer suffered a fractured skull.\n\nThe threat ended when Officer Michael Hanna shot Bickford in the shoulder. At a hospital, Bickford told authorities that he had studied radical Islamic ideology and decided to wage jihad against U.S. officials.\n\nThe judge cited the 20-year-old Bickford\u00b4s age and history of mental illness as reasons for leniency from federal sentencing guidelines that recommended a life term. Prosecutors had requested a 50-year sentence while the defense recommended a 10-year term.\n\nHe also recounted how Bickford's mother had repeatedly sought help from police and hospitals as she saw her son's descent into mental illnesses that have been diagnosed to include schizoaffective bipolar disorder and major depression syndrome with symptoms of depression, mania and psychosis, including grandiosity and hallucinations.\n\nThe judge said Bickford told mental health professionals 20 days before the New Year's Eve attack that he had a plan for harming others, intended to act on the plan and wanted to commit a jihadist attack.\n\n\"I\u00b4m not a medical person, not here to judge the medical people who saw this and met with him, but it\u00b4s disturbing to read these records,\" Castel said. \"If his mother was listened to, her instincts were listened to, if the medical profession could look at things a little differently, this might not have happened.\"\n\nGiven a chance to speak, Bickford apologized to the officers he harmed and other witnesses to his crime.\n\n\"I understand that I left scars, physical and mental,\" he said. \"My mental illness took me down a dark path.\"\n\nHanna, the first officer to speak at the sentencing, recalled the attack, saying he had just ducked his head slightly when he \"saw a large blade swiping next to my head\" and spun around to see Bickford chasing him with a machete that contained a 13-inch blade.\n\n\"As he continued to approach, I took my firearm out and discharged one bullet, which immediately struck the defendant. He dropped to the ground,\" Hanna said.\n\nThe officer said his parents had immigrated from the Middle East two decades ago \"to escape this type of thing.\"\n\nOfficer Louis Lorio said he could barely remain conscious after a large cut to his scalp required seven stitches that night.\n\nNow, he said, he suffers migraine headaches several days a week and is likely to be forced into retirement after a decade-long police career as he copes with anxiety and depression that cause him to \"burst out crying for no reason\" or cripple him with waves of sadness. Therapy, though, has helped, he added.\n\nOfficer Paul Cozzolino, who had graduated from the police academy only a day before the attack, said some physical pain such as headaches will last forever. He choked up as he said the part he will \"cherish forever\" was when he went home to his family that night.\n\nDefense attorney Marisa Cabrera said her client, who is \"deeply remorseful,\" comes from a family with a \"strong and proud military background,\" including two grandparents who served in the U.S. Navy, a brother currently in the military and a younger brother who plans to join.\n\nBickford wanted to join the military too before psychological illnesses took over, she said.\n\nNow, she said, \"Bickford has returned to his old self with the aid of medication and treatment.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Kaylan Lasky, though, urged the judge to ignore Bickford's \"self-serving claims\" of rehabilitation, particularly because he could return to his former state of mind if he ever went off his medication.\n\nShe said he \"should not be given another opportunity to kill Americans\" after he \"injured, maimed and terrorized innocent New Yorkers.\"\n\nThe judge ordered that after Bickford gets out of prison, authorities monitor his internet usage and other facets of his existence for the rest of his life.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takbir", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Takbir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Kevin_Castel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P.

Kevin Castel listened to emotional statements from the three police officers who Bickford attacked about two hours before midnight on Dec. 21, 2022, as the officers screened New Year's revelers at the sole entrance to an otherwise closed-off Times Square.\n\nBickford shouted \"Allahu akbar\" -- the Arabic phrase for \"God is great\" -- before striking the officers in the head with the machete and trying to grab an officer's gun. One officer suffered a fractured skull.\n\nThe threat ended when Officer Michael Hanna shot Bickford in the shoulder. At a hospital, Bickford told authorities that he had studied radical Islamic ideology and decided to wage jihad against U.S. officials.\n\nThe judge cited the 20-year-old Bickford's age and history of mental illness as reasons for leniency from federal sentencing guidelines that recommended a life term. Prosecutors had requested a 50-year sentence while the defense recommended a 10-year term.\n\nHe also recounted how Bickford's mother had repeatedly sought help from police and hospitals as she saw her son's descent into mental illnesses that have been diagnosed to include schizoaffective bipolar disorder and major depression syndrome with symptoms of depression, mania and psychosis, including grandiosity and hallucinations.\n\nThe judge said Bickford told mental health professionals 20 days before the New Year's Eve attack that he had a plan for harming others, intended to act on the plan and wanted to commit a jihadist attack.\n\n\"I'm not a medical person, not here to judge the medical people who saw this and met with him, but it's disturbing to read these records,\" Castel said. \"If his mother was listened to, her instincts were listened to, if the medical profession could look at things a little differently, this might not have happened.\"\n\nGiven a chance to speak, Bickford apologized to the officers he harmed and other witnesses to his crime.\n\n\"I understand that I left scars, physical and mental,\" he said. \"My mental illness took me down a dark path.\"\n\nHanna, the first officer to speak at the sentencing, recalled the attack, saying he had just ducked his head slightly when he \"saw a large blade swiping next to my head\" and spun around to see Bickford chasing him with a machete that contained a 13-inch blade.\n\n\"As he continued to approach, I took my firearm out and discharged one bullet, which immediately struck the defendant. He dropped to the ground,\" Hanna said.\n\nThe officer said his parents had immigrated from the Middle East two decades ago \"to escape this type of thing.\"\n\nOfficer Louis Lorio said he could barely remain conscious after a large cut to his scalp required seven stitches that night.\n\nNow, he said, he suffers migraine headaches several days a week and is likely to be forced into retirement after a decade-long police career as he copes with anxiety and depression that cause him to \"burst out crying for no reason\" or cripple him with waves of sadness. Therapy, though, has helped, he added.\n\nOfficer Paul Cozzolino, who had graduated from the police academy only a day before the attack, said some physical pain such as headaches will last forever. He choked up as he said the part he will \"cherish forever\" was when he went home to his family that night.\n\nDefense attorney Marisa Cabrera said her client, who is \"deeply remorseful,\" comes from a family with a \"strong and proud military background,\" including two grandparents who served in the U.S. Navy, a brother currently in the military and a younger brother who plans to join.\n\nBickford wanted to join the military too before psychological illnesses took over, she said.\n\nNow, she said, \"Bickford has returned to his old self with the aid of medication and treatment.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Kaylan Lasky, though, urged the judge to ignore Bickford's \"self-serving claims\" of rehabilitation, particularly because he could return to his former state of mind if he ever went off his medication.\n\nShe said he \"should not be given another opportunity to kill Americans\" after he \"injured, maimed and terrorized innocent New Yorkers.\"\n\nThe judge ordered that after Bickford gets out of prison, authorities monitor his internet usage and other facets of his existence for the rest of his life.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bickford's_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bickford's Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takbir", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Takbir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Kevin_Castel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P.

They said Bickford \"left his victims -- including those he forced to witness and live through a terrorist attack -- traumatized.\"\n\nOne officer, who was working his first day after graduating from the NYPD academy, suffered a skull fracture and laceration to the back of his head that required more than a dozen stitches.

He has not been able to return to work. He said \"everything\" in his life has changed and the assault may end his career,\" prosecutors wrote in court documents.\n\nBut Bickford's family pleaded in letters they sent to Castel to take a step back and consider Bickford's troubling signs of untreated mental illness in the months leading up to the attack.\n\nIn court records, they described psychotic symptoms that first began in spring 2022 -- hallucinations of shadowy figures out of the corner of his eye, tingling in his hands and lips, the feeling of a leech on his face and popping noises that told him if he was making the right decisions.\n\nHis family said they were troubled when Bickford began obsessively watching YouTube videos about Islam, praying for six hours a day and planning to go to the Middle East to join the Taliban. It was out of character for a young man who had excelled in school and athletics and had never demonstrated an interest in Islam before.\n\nHigh school friends said they later learned Bickford had been living in fear of an abusive father who was hyper-fixated on Bickford's participation in wrestling. Bickford began to spiral after his father died in 2018 of an accidental overdose, they wrote, before the hallucinations began and he was prompted to explore different religions.\n\nWeeks before the Times Square attack, Bickford told his mother he was a prophet and needed to travel to the Middle East. She took him to the hospital, concerned by his psychotic behavior, but he was soon discharged with a referral to outpatient treatment, according to a letter she submitted to the judge in which she urged him to have mercy on her son.\n\nHis lawyers in letters to the judge cited experts in terrorism-related cases who found that Bickford's attack was \"not the result of radicalization or extremism, but a product of ongoing auditory, tactile and visual hallucinations.\"\n\nSince Bickford's arrest, he is now receiving treatment and says he is ashamed of his actions.\n\nIn his own letter to Castel, Bickford said he takes responsibility for what he did.\n\n\"I didn't know it then, but I was sick. I was hearing voices and noises that weren't there, but to me, they felt real,\" Bickford wrote. \"By the time I attacked the officers, I had become someone else.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

He said \"everything\" in his life has changed and the assault may end his career,\" prosecutors wrote in court documents.\n\nBut Bickford's family pleaded in letters they sent to Castel to take a step back and consider Bickford's troubling signs of untreated mental illness in the months leading up to the attack.\n\nIn court records, they described psychotic symptoms that first began in spring 2022 -- hallucinations of shadowy figures out of the corner of his eye, tingling in his hands and lips, the feeling of a leech on his face and popping noises that told him if he was making the right decisions.\n\nHis family said they were troubled when Bickford began obsessively watching YouTube videos about Islam, praying for six hours a day and planning to go to the Middle East to join the Taliban. It was out of character for a young man who had excelled in school and athletics and had never demonstrated an interest in Islam before.\n\nHigh school friends said they later learned Bickford had been living in fear of an abusive father who was hyper-fixated on Bickford's participation in wrestling. Bickford began to spiral after his father died in 2018 of an accidental overdose, they wrote, before the hallucinations began and he was prompted to explore different religions.\n\nWeeks before the Times Square attack, Bickford told his mother he was a prophet and needed to travel to the Middle East. She took him to the hospital, concerned by his psychotic behavior, but he was soon discharged with a referral to outpatient treatment, according to a letter she submitted to the judge in which she urged him to have mercy on her son.\n\nHis lawyers in letters to the judge cited experts in terrorism-related cases who found that Bickford's attack was \"not the result of radicalization or extremism, but a product of ongoing auditory, tactile and visual hallucinations.\"\n\nSince Bickford's arrest, he is now receiving treatment and says he is ashamed of his actions.\n\nIn his own letter to Castel, Bickford said he takes responsibility for what he did.\n\n\"I didn't know it then, but I was sick. I was hearing voices and noises that weren't there, but to me, they felt real,\" Bickford wrote. \"By the time I attacked the officers, I had become someone else.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

All of the officers survived.\n\nAfter the attack, Bickford admitted he was trying to take out as many military-aged men as possible so he could become a martyr and inspire other Islamic extremists, the feds say.\n\nThe teenager became radicalized in the summer of 2022 after he consumed Islamic and al Qaeda propaganda.\n\nThe FBI had a few weeks warning about Bickford after his mom flagged to local cops that her son had become obsessed with the religion. The feds were notified by police on Dec. 10.\n\nManhattan US Attorney Damian Williams lauded the message such a serious sentence sends to others contemplating terrorist acts.\n\n\"Bickford's conviction and sentence demonstrate that cowardly acts of terrorism will be met with law enforcement's unwavering resolve to protect New York City, our country, and our core values of freedom and democracy,\" Williams said.\n\nBickford pleaded guilty to three counts of attempted murder of officers and employees of the US government and persons assisting them and three counts of assault of officers and employees of the US government and persons assisting them.\n\nHe still faces a separate case for the same incident in state court.

This decision emerged from the 22nd Annual Bilateral Summit in Moscow, where Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated their commitment to a \"special and privileged strategic partnership.\"\n\nThe two sides agreed on nine key areas of cooperations that spanned trade, trade settlement using national currencies, increased cargo turnover through new routes such as the North-South Transport Corridor, raising volume of trade in agri products, food and fertiliser, deepening cooperation in the energy sector, including nuclear energy, strengthening interaction for infrastructure development, promotion of investments and joint projects across digital economy, collaborating on supply of medicines and development of humanitarian cooperation.\n\nThe leaders agreed to aspire \"for elimination of non-tariff trade barriers related to bilateral trade between India and Russia\" and continue \"dialogue in the field of liberalisation of bilateral trade, including the possibility of the establishment of the EAEU-India Free Trade Area\".\n\nIn the joint statement following the summit, both leaders expressed their intention to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and continue discussions on trade liberalization, including the possibility of establishing an EAEU-India Free Trade Area. They also committed to achieving a mutually agreed trade volume of more than USD 100 billion by 2030. This includes increased supplies of goods from India to balance bilateral trade and invigorating investment activities within special investment regimes.\n\nA major aspect of the agreement is developing a bilateral settlement system using national currencies. This arrangement allows India to pay for Russian imports, such as crude oil, in Indian rupees. Russia can then use these rupees to pay for Indian exports. The same system applies vice versa with Russian rubles. \"Development of a bilateral settlement system using national currencies\" is a key part of the joint statement.\n\nThe leaders agreed to increase cargo turnover by launching new routes like the North-South International Transport Corridor, the Northern Sea Route, and the Chennai-Vladivostok Sea Line. They also discussed optimizing customs procedures through intelligent digital systems to facilitate barrier-free movement of goods. \"Increase of cargo turnover with India through the launch of new routes... and optimization of customs procedures\" was emphasized in their statement.\n\nThe agreement includes plans to raise the volume of bilateral trade in agricultural products, food, and fertilizers. Both sides aim to maintain an intensive dialogue to remove veterinary, sanitary, and phytosanitary restrictions and prohibitions. In the energy sector, they agreed to cooperate in nuclear energy, oil refining, and petrochemicals, and to expand forms of cooperation and partnership in energy infrastructure, technologies, and equipment. \"Development of cooperation in key energy sectors, including nuclear energy... and expanded forms of cooperation and partnership in the field of energy infrastructure\" was highlighted.\n\nBoth countries will strengthen interactions in infrastructure development, transport engineering, automobile production, shipbuilding, space, and other industrial sectors. They plan to facilitate the entry of Indian and Russian companies into each other's markets by creating subsidiaries and industrial clusters. \"Strengthening of interaction in the fields of infrastructure development... and facilitation of entry of Indian and Russian companies in each other's markets\" were key points.\n\nThe leaders committed to promoting investments and joint projects across various sectors of the digital economy, science, and research, including educational exchanges and internships for employees of high-tech companies. They also agreed to promote systematic cooperation in the development and supply of medicines and advanced medical equipment, and to explore opening branches of Indian medical institutions in Russia. \"Promotion of investments and joint projects across various sectors of digital economy\" and \"promotion of systematic cooperation in the development and supply of medicines\" were notable aspects.\n\nThe summit also emphasized expanding humanitarian cooperation in education, science and technology, culture, tourism, sports, healthcare, and other areas. Both sides instructed the Russian-Indian Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technical, and Cultural Cooperation to study these priority areas and assess progress at its next meeting. \"Development of humanitarian cooperation, consistent expansion of interaction in the fields of education, science and technology, culture, tourism, sports, healthcare, and other areas\" was part of the joint statement.\n\nThe 22nd Annual Bilateral Summit between India and Russia took place in Moscow on July 8-9, 2024. President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed current issues of bilateral cooperation and the development of their strategic partnership. They focused on mutual respect, equality, and the sovereign development of both countries on a long-term, mutually beneficial basis. The summit resulted in a comprehensive joint statement detailing nine key areas of cooperation, aiming to enhance trade, economic ties, and humanitarian collaboration between the two nations.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bilateral trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_barrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade barrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_route", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade route"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Sea_Route", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Sea Route"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian ruble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111613577,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-6924,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718891", "eventUri": "eng-9718891", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 5630, "textEnd": 5636}], "sentiment": 0.7098039215686274, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

This decision emerged from the 22nd Annual Bilateral Summit in Moscow, where Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated their commitment to a \"special and privileged strategic partnership.\"\n\nThe two sides agreed on nine key areas of cooperations that spanned trade, trade settlement using national currencies, increased cargo turnover through new routes such as the North-South Transport Corridor, raising volume of trade in agri products, food and fertiliser, deepening cooperation in the energy sector, including nuclear energy, strengthening interaction for infrastructure development, promotion of investments and joint projects across digital economy, collaborating on supply of medicines and development of humanitarian cooperation.\n\nThe leaders agreed to aspire \"for elimination of non-tariff trade barriers related to bilateral trade between India and Russia\" and continue \"dialogue in the field of liberalisation of bilateral trade, including the possibility of the establishment of the EAEU-India Free Trade Area\".\n\nKey Points of Agreement Elimination of Trade Barriers: Focus on reducing non-tariff barriers and exploring an EAEU-India Free Trade Area. Currency Settlement System: Implementing national currencies for trade to simplify transactions. New Trade Routes: Enhancing cargo turnover with new routes like the North-South Corridor and Chennai-Vladivostok Sea Line. Agricultural and Energy Cooperation: Increasing trade in agricultural products and collaborating in nuclear energy and oil refining. Infrastructure Development: Strengthening ties in transport engineering, shipbuilding, and space sectors. Digital Economy and Medical Advancements: Promoting joint projects in the digital economy and enhancing medical cooperation. Humanitarian Collaboration: Expanding ties in education, culture, tourism, and healthcare.\n\nExpanding Trade and Economic Cooperation\n\nIn the joint statement following the summit, both leaders expressed their intention to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and continue discussions on trade liberalization, including the possibility of establishing an EAEU-India Free Trade Area. They also committed to achieving a mutually agreed trade volume of more than USD 100 billion by 2030. This includes increased supplies of goods from India to balance bilateral trade and invigorating investment activities within special investment regimes.\n\nUtilizing National Currencies\n\nA major aspect of the agreement is developing a bilateral settlement system using national currencies. This arrangement allows India to pay for Russian imports, such as crude oil, in Indian rupees. Russia can then use these rupees to pay for Indian exports. The same system applies vice versa with Russian rubles. \"Development of a bilateral settlement system using national currencies\" is a key part of the joint statement.\n\nEnhancing Trade Routes and Customs Procedures\n\nThe leaders agreed to increase cargo turnover by launching new routes like the North-South International Transport Corridor, the Northern Sea Route, and the Chennai-Vladivostok Sea Line. They also discussed optimizing customs procedures through intelligent digital systems to facilitate barrier-free movement of goods. \"Increase of cargo turnover with India through the launch of new routes... and optimization of customs procedures\" was emphasized in their statement.\n\nBoosting Agricultural and Energy Trade\n\nThe agreement includes plans to raise the volume of bilateral trade in agricultural products, food, and fertilizers. Both sides aim to maintain an intensive dialogue to remove veterinary, sanitary, and phytosanitary restrictions and prohibitions. In the energy sector, they agreed to cooperate in nuclear energy, oil refining, and petrochemicals, and to expand forms of cooperation and partnership in energy infrastructure, technologies, and equipment. \"Development of cooperation in key energy sectors, including nuclear energy... and expanded forms of cooperation and partnership in the field of energy infrastructure\" was highlighted.\n\nInfrastructure and Industrial Collaboration\n\nBoth countries will strengthen interactions in infrastructure development, transport engineering, automobile production, shipbuilding, space, and other industrial sectors.

Greater cooperation in key energy sectors, including nuclear energy, oil refining, and petrochemicals also found mention in the document, with a focus on \"facilitation of mutual and international energy security, taking into account the prospects of global energy transition\".\n\nWith exports to Russia only at $4.2 billion, both sides stressed the need for increasing the volume of trade in agricultural products, food and fertilizers. In 2023-24, India's trade deficit with Russia stood at $57 billion.\n\nOptimisation of Customs procedures through the application of intelligent digital systems for barrier-free movement of goods.\n\nA lot of this trade is expected to take place through key global routes like the North-South International Transport Corridor, the Northern Sea Route and the Chennai-Vladivostok Sea Line, the two sides said.\n\nA trade agreement between Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) -- comprising Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia -- was also discussed. \"The two leaders also spoke about the need to move forward on the India Eurasian Economic Union trade goods agreement. We had one round of discussions between the two countries and it is expected that this would be expedited in the months ahead,\" Kwatra said.\n\nThe statement has also called for the facilitation of entry of Indian and Russian companies in each other's markets by creating subsidiaries and industrial clusters. Similarly, both have called for creating new joint (subsidiary) companies by providing them with favourable fiscal regimes.\n\nPromotion of investments and joint projects across various sectors of digital economy, science and research, educational exchanges and internships for employees of high-tech companies have also been targeted.\n\nUkraine war\n\nIn his televised opening remarks at summit talks with Putin at the Kremlin, the PM said the killing of innocent children is heart-wrenching and very painful, a day after a suspected Russian missile struck a children's hospital in Kyiv triggering global outrage. \"Every person who believes in humanity is pained when there is a loss of lives. But when innocent children are killed it causes deep pain. I have spoken to you at length about this,\" Modi told Putin.\n\nThe prime minister's remarks that appeared to be critical of Russia came hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticised Modi for hugging Putin. \"It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day,\" Zelenskyy posted on X.\n\nIn his remarks, Modi also referred to his extensive discussions on the Ukraine conflict with Putin during a private meeting on Monday evening and said dialogue is the only way to find a solution. \"For a bright future for the future generations, peace is most essential. No solution is possible on the battlefield. Solutions and peace talks are not successful in the midst of bombs, guns and bullets and we have to find the path to peace through dialogue,\" he said.\n\n\"For restoration of peace, India is ready to cooperate in all possible ways,\" Modi said, as he appreciated the attention Putin paid to the most pressing issues, \"including your efforts to find ways to resolve the Ukraine crisis, primarily through peaceful means.\"\n\nModi's first international visit after he took charge as Prime Minister for the third time, the trip to Russia has been closely watched owing to its geopolitical implications. In the run up to the trip, the Kremlin had claimed the West was jealous of the visit while the US State Department said it has made quite clear directly with India its concerns about India's relationship with Russia.\n\nDuring the day, both leaders were also shown a permanent working model of the VVER-1000 reactor used at Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu, manufactured by the Russian Atomic Agency Rosatom.\n\nThe Prime Minister also interacted with the Indian community in Russia, where he announced the government has decided to open two new Indian Consulates in Kazan and Ekaterinburg. The two-day trip also saw the PM pay his respects at Moscow's tomb of the unknown soldier, dedicated to the Soviet soldiers who lost their lives during World War II.\n\nIn the evening, the PM left in Vienna. It will be the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Austria in over 40 years, the last being of Indira Gandhi in 1983.", "source": {"uri": "bilaterals.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Narendra Modi paid an official visit to the Russian Federation on July 8-9, 2024 at the invitation of President of the Russian Federation H.E. Mr. Vladimir Putin for the 22nd India - Russia Annual Summit. During the visit, H.E. Mr. President Vladimir Putin conferred Russia's highest civilian honour the \"Order of Saint Andrew the Apostle\" on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his distinguished contribution to the development of Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia and friendly ties between the peoples of the two countries.\n\nAccording to a press release, the Leaders noted the continued strengthening and deepening of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia. The Leaders highly appreciated the special nature of this time-tested relationship which is based on trust, mutual understanding and strategic convergence. Regular bilateral engagement at all levels, including during India's Chairship of SCO and G20 in 2023 and under Russia's Chairship of BRICS in 2024, helped in further deepening and expansion of the growing bilateral partnership. The Leaders positively assessed the multi-faceted mutually beneficial India-Russia relations that span all possible areas of cooperation including political and strategic, military and security, trade and investment, energy, science and technology, nuclear, space, cultural, education and humanitarian cooperation. It was noted with satisfaction that both Sides are actively exploring new avenues for cooperation while further strengthening cooperation in the traditional areas. The Sides underlined that India-Russia ties have remained resilient in the backdrop of the prevailing complex, challenging and uncertain geopolitical situation. Both Sides have strived to forge a contemporary, balanced, mutually beneficial, sustainable and long-term partnership. Development of the India-Russia relations over the entire spectrum of cooperation areas is a shared foreign policy priority. The Leaders agreed to make all efforts to unlock the full potential of the strategic partnership.\n\nThe Leaders appreciated the close cooperation between the Foreign Ministries and frequent meetings and exchanges between the Foreign Ministers for nurturing and steering the bilateral partnership through the constantly evolving and complex geopolitical scenario and adapting it to the changing circumstances. The regular close engagement has also helped in a deeper understanding and appreciation of each other's core interests, positions on international issues and in various international and multilateral organizations. The Leaders welcomed the Protocol on Foreign Office Consultations for the period 2024-28 signed in December 2023 between the Ministry of External Affairs of India and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation which lays down the foundation for exchanges and dialogue on most pressing bilateral, global and regional issues. They noted with satisfaction the regular holding of Foreign Office Consultations on bilateral, UN related, Counter-Terrorism, Consular and Property matters as well as regional and global issues of mutual interest.\n\nThe two sides agreed on nine key cooperation areas, including trade, trade settlement using national currencies, increased cargo turnover through new routes like the North-South Transport Corridor, boosting trade volume in agricultural products, food, and fertilizer, enhancing cooperation in the energy sector, including nuclear energy, strengthening infrastructure development, promoting investments and joint projects in the digital economy, collaborating on medicine supply, and developing humanitarian cooperation.\n\nThe leaders expressed their aim to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers between India and Russia and continue discussions on liberalizing bilateral trade, including the possibility of establishing the EAEU-India Free Trade Area.

Bilateral trade ballooned to $65.7 billion in 2023-24, largely because of India's uptake of discounted Russian crude after the imposition of Western sanctions, but concerns have grown in New Delhi about the trade being skewed as Indian exports are worth less than $5 billion.\n\nIn his opening remarks at the annual bilateral summit, Modi said Indian citizens faced no difficulties with the supply of petrol and diesel amid a global fuel crisis because of Putin's cooperation. Putin noted in his remarks that two-way trade had grown 66% in 2023 and by another 20% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi wraps up high-profile Russia visit, heads to Austria\n\n\"The world will have to acknowledge that the agreement between India and Russia on fuel played an indirect role in giving market stability...to the world,\" Modi said, speaking in Hindi and referring to India's increased purchases of Russian energy after the start of the Ukraine conflict.\n\nRussia has emerged as an important partner in meeting India's energy needs, supplying more than 80 million metric tons of crude last year. Indian officials said securing affordable energy supplies to keep inflation and price rise under check was an important part of the discussions in Moscow.\n\nModi also said that at a time when the world was passing through a crisis of food, fuel and fertilisers, he was able to address the concerns of Indian farmers over the supply of fertilisers because of Russia's cooperation. \"We are committed to protect the interests of farmers in the coming times too, and we want our cooperation with Russia to increase even more for the interests of the farmers,\" he said.\n\nAlso Read | Vladimir Putin awards PM Modi Russia's highest civilian honour for 'outstanding service'\n\nRussia remains a key supplier of fertilisers, providing more than 4.8 million tonnes of the commodity last year. This supply is crucial, especially during the ongoing Kharif season and the Ravi season starting in October, officials said. The two sides agreed to continue cooperation on the sustainable supply of fertilisers to India through company-to-company long-term contracts.\n\nThe two sides discussed a range of measures aimed at both growing bilateral trade and making it more balanced, especially in view of trade being currently skewed in Russia's favour. Foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra told a media briefing after the summit that the economic agenda had dominated the discussions between the two leaders, who discussed in detail the challenges to the trade and investment partnership.\n\nModi raised the need to broaden India's trade basket and sought greater market access for Indian agricultural and industrial goods. The discussions also centred round making India's trade basket more sustainable, Kwatra said.\n\nModi also noted Putin's public support for the \"Make in India\" initiative and for manufacturing in India, saying these steps had created many new employment opportunities for the country's youth.\n\nA joint statement on developing strategic areas of Russia-India economic cooperation up to 2030 outline nine key areas for cooperation, including elimination of non-tariff trade barriers and dialogue for liberalisation of bilateral trade, including the establishment of a Eurasian Economic Union-India free trade area.\n\nAs part of the trade target of $100 billion by 2030, the two sides will cooperate to increase the supplies of Indian goods to achieve balanced trade and reinvigorate investment activities within the framework of special investment regimes. They will also develop a bilateral settlement system using national currencies and introduce digital financial instruments into mutual settlements, the joint statement said.\n\nRussia will work to increase cargo turnover with India through the launch of new routes of the North-South International Transport Corridor, Northern Sea Route and Chennai-Vladivostok sea line. Customs procedures will be optimised by using intelligent digital systems for barrier-free movement of goods, the joint statement added.\n\nIn an apparent move to overcome the impact of Western sanctions, a separate joint statement issued after the 22nd India-Russia Summit said the two sides will continue consultations for \"interoperability of their financial messaging systems\". The two sides also \"noted the importance of finding mutually acceptable solutions for issues of insurance and reinsurance\" to further enhance bilateral trade.\n\nIn the field of civil nuclear cooperation, the two sides agreed to adhere to the schedule, including the timelines for delivery of supplies, for building the four remaining reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant. Kwatra said cooperation on fuel supplies for these four reactors was part of the discussions. \"We hope to move forward on fuel supplies quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"Both sides noted the importance of further discussion on the second site in India [for a nuclear power plant] in accordance with earlier signed agreements. The sides agreed to continue technical discussions on the VVER 1200 of the Russian design, localisation of equipment and joint manufacturing of NPP components as well as on cooperation in third countries,\" the joint statement said.\n\nThe two sides also confirmed their intention to broaden cooperation in nuclear power, including fuel cycle, life cycle support for operating the Kudankulum nuclear power plant.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type":

It was also his first trip to the country since the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine in 2022.\n\nEfforts for peace\n\nWhile the bilateral talks were focused mainly on economic cooperation between the two nations, the leaders had a \"frank\" conversation about the Ukraine conflict and geopolitical situation globally. Ahead of closed-door talks at the Kremlin, and a day after spending several hours at Russian President Vladimir Putin's official residence in Moscow's suburbs, Modi stated that the solution to any conflict \"cannot be found on the battlefield\" and that the death of civilians, particularly children, \"makes the heart explode.\"\n\nThe Russian leader thanked Modi for the attention he is paying to the world's \"most pressing problems, including trying to find some ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis.\"\n\nThe Indian prime minister noted that Putin was \"very open in expressing his opinions\" on the Ukraine conflict and stated that \"very interesting ideas\" and \"completely new views\" emerged from their talks. \"And I can say that after listening to President Putin, I have hope,\" Modi added.\n\nThe friendly interactions between the two leaders during the course of Modi's stay in the Russian capital annoyed Kiev and Washington, with the latter making repeated comments on \"concerns\" it has over New Delhi's close ties with Moscow.\n\nBilateral trade\n\nRussia and India have set a goal of reaching $100 billion in bilateral trade by 2030. Previously, the leaders had a target of $30 billion by 2025, which was surpassed by a significant margin during the last financial year.\n\nIn 2023, bilateral trade stood at $65 billion, having been driven by a surge in oil purchases. However, Indian exports to Russia stood at less than $5 billion, and both countries emphasized the importance of diversifying trade to make it more sustainable going forward.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Putin's top economic adviser Maksim Oreshkin, suitable payment mechanisms also featured in the leaders' discussions. Secure infrastructure for ensuring sustainable trade and investments \"is one of the important issues\" for the two nations, he said.\n\nAccording to Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra, the $100 billion target for bilateral trade is \"first of all, an expression by the two leaders of the ambition that they have set for the larger economic relationship.\" It is also a \"very clear direction to the two systems\" to boost efforts to diversify the trade basket.\n\nEnergy cooperation\n\nRussia has emerged as India's key supplier of oil after the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022, despite open criticism from New Delhi's Western partners.\n\nCheaper crude oil from Russia has also facilitated India's value-added petroleum product exports, contributing to a 54.78% increase in exports of petroleum products during April-January FY23. Countries such as Brazil, Israel, the Netherlands, and South Africa have witnessed substantial growth in consumption of Indian exports, with petroleum products playing a crucial role. In their joint statement, the two countries said they had \"agreed to explore new long term contracts.\"\n\nThe two sides also agreed to explore the possibility for further increasing the supply of coking coal and the opportunities for exporting anthracite coal from Russia to India.\n\nCommenting on the energy cooperation talks, Kwatra noted that India's oil imports from Russia are not just an important feature of bilateral ties, but also \"a very crucial segment when it comes to the energy security of India.\"\n\nIndia has not only imported Russian crude, but invested in the Russian energy ecosystem, including the Sakhalin-1 oil project. \"The two leaders, when they spoke of cooperation in this sector, they did focus on how exactly to strengthen that partnership. In the similar way, how exactly India, including in particular through the government-to-government route, could also build partnership with Rosneft and other energy entities,\" the Indian diplomat said.\n\nNuclear power\n\nMoscow and New Delhi also discussed expanding cooperation in the nuclear energy field. Russia has so far been the only foreign country involved in constructing nuclear power generating capacity in India.\n\nRussian nuclear technology has been instrumental in the construction of the 6000 MW Kudankulam NPP in the southern part of the country. The plant's first two units, each with a capacity of 1000 MW, entered service in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Two more units are nearing completion, and the construction of two others began in 2021. The project was extensively discussed by the leaders.\n\nThe joint statement also notes that the two sides agreed to continue technical discussions on a potential new nuclear power plant of Russian design with a more advanced VVER-1200 reactor (this model of water-cooled power reactor is supplied to nuclear power plants in China, Bangladesh, Belarus and other countries).\n\nMoscow and New Delhi also discussed localizing manufacturing and joint production of nuclear power plant components, as well as operating projects in third countries. India is already participating in Rosatom's project for construction of a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.\n\nDuring a tour of the Atom Pavilion in Moscow, the two leaders saw details of a range of different nuclear energy technologies and projects, including nuclear-powered ice breakers and floating nuclear power plants. Such plants, according to Putin, could eventually \"replace the oil produced around the world.\" Rosatom Director General Alexei Likhachev told Modi that Russia could offer small nuclear power stations to India with \"very deep localization,\" TASS reported.\n\nDefence\n\nThe joint statement underscores that military-technical cooperation between the two countries has traditionally been the central pillar of ties. The two sides agreed to hold the next round of talks by the Intergovernmental Commission on Military and Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) which oversees strategic and defense engagement in Moscow, in the second half of this year.\n\nNotably, the statement mentions the changing nature of defense cooperation - in what seems like a \"response\" to allegations that India has been \"drifting away\" from Russia as its largest defense partner in terms of volumes of supplies. \"Responding to India's quest for self-sufficiency, the partnership is reorienting presently to joint research and development, co-development and joint production of advanced defence technology and systems,\" the statement says, adding that both nations pledge to \"maintain the momentum\" of joint military cooperation activities.\n\nAhead of the summit, Rosoboronexport, Russia's defense-export agency and part of state-owned Rostec defense corporation, announced setting up the production of 3VBM17 'Mango' rounds in the South Asian country under the 'Make In India' initiative. The 125-mm projectiles are designed for firing from the main gun of the T-72 and T-90 tanks deployed by India's military.\n\nRostec also announced that another Indo-Russian joint venture produced and delivered 35,000 AK-203 Kalashnikov rifles to the Indian Ministry of Defense. The joint venture was set up in Korwa Ordnance Factory in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, in 2019.\n\nRussia remains the largest defense supplier to India, though the South Asian nation has been diversifying its sources of military imports and technological partnerships, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). BrahMos missiles, co-developed by India and Russia, have emerged as a mainstay in the Indian Armed Forces, as well as a key military export item for New Delhi.\n\nEarly this year, a batch of BrahMos missiles worth $375 million was supplied to the Philippines. Other nations - including Thailand, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia - have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring the supersonic cruise missiles.\n\nRussia has also recently approved the draft of the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement. It is a mutual defense logistics pact that will ensure joint inter-operability between the Russian and Indian armed forces during military exercises, as well as in case of deployment for humanitarian and disaster relief missions.\n\nREAD MORE: India not abandoning Russian weaponry - envoy\n\n\"Agreements of this kind expand the geographic opportunities for peacetime operations for all participating parties. Currently, this is less relevant for Russia since its main efforts are focused on the military operation in Ukraine, but after the conflict ends, this agreement will be useful,\" Alexey Kupriyanov, head of the Center of the Indo-Pacific Region of the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO), told RT.\n\n\"It is possible that the provisions of this agreement will apply in the case of joint exercises in Arctic territories and waters of the Arctic Ocean. From the perspective of Indian military elites and the expert community, this is important because Delhi is concerned about increased Chinese activity in polar regions,\" the expert added.\n\nConnectivity\n\nThe two countries also discussed the progress achieved in opening up two vital routes that could boost trade and economic engagement by reducing time and the cost of logistics and providing a secure alternative to existing maritime routes such as the Suez Canal. The two countries are working on implementing the Chennai-Vladivostok (Eastern Maritime) Corridor and the International North-South Transport Corridor via Iran, as well as using the potential of the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic.\n\n\"The Sides share approaches on building a new architecture of stable and efficient transport corridors, and pay close attention to the development of promising production and marketing chains in Eurasia, including for the purpose of implementing the idea of a Greater Eurasian space,\" the statement noted.\n\nIt emphasized, in what seems to be a veiled reference to the Chinese Road and Belt Initiative rejected by India, that the new routes will be developed following several principles - \"transparency, broad participation, local priorities, financial sustainability and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.\"\n\nLogistics and payment settlement issues remain the key obstacles for exporters in both countries. However, the new trade routes will not only boost bilateral commerce between India and Russia, but also provide New Delhi with greater access to the markets of Central Asia, Europe, and the vital Arctic Region, where Indian interests are growing.", "source": {"uri": "indiagazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was also his first trip to the country since the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine in 2022.\n\nWhile the bilateral talks were focused mainly on economic cooperation between the two nations, the leaders had a \"frank\" conversation about the Ukraine conflict and geopolitical situation globally. Ahead of closed-door talks at the Kremlin, and a day after spending several hours at Russian President Vladimir Putin's official residence in Moscow's suburbs, Modi stated that the solution to any conflict \"cannot be found on the battlefield\" and that the death of civilians, particularly children, \"makes the heart explode.\"\n\nThe Russian leader thanked Modi for the attention he is paying to the world's \"most pressing problems, including trying to find some ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis.\"\n\nThe Indian prime minister noted that Putin was \"very open in expressing his opinions\" on the Ukraine conflict and stated that \"very interesting ideas\" and \"completely new views\" emerged from their talks. \"And I can say that after listening to President Putin, I have hope,\" Modi added.\n\nThe friendly interactions between the two leaders during the course of Modi's stay in the Russian capital annoyed Kiev and Washington, with the latter making repeated comments on \"concerns\" it has over New Delhi's close ties with Moscow.\n\nRussia and India have set a goal of reaching $100 billion in bilateral trade by 2030. Previously, the leaders had a target of $30 billion by 2025, which was surpassed by a significant margin during the last financial year.\n\nIn 2023, bilateral trade stood at $65 billion, having been driven by a surge in oil purchases. However, Indian exports to Russia stood at less than $5 billion, and both countries emphasized the importance of diversifying trade to make it more sustainable going forward.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Putin's top economic adviser Maksim Oreshkin, suitable payment mechanisms also featured in the leaders' discussions. Secureinfrastructure for ensuring sustainable trade and investments \"is one of the important issues\" for the two nations, he said.\n\nAccording to Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra, the $100 billion target for bilateral trade is \"first of all, an expression by the two leaders of the ambition that they have set for the larger economic relationship.\" It is also a \"very clear direction to the two systems\" to boost efforts to diversify the trade basket.\n\nRussia has emerged as India's key supplier of oil after the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022, despite open criticism from New Delhi's Western partners.\n\nCheaper crude oil from Russia has also facilitated India's value-added petroleum product exports, contributing to a 54.78% increase in exports of petroleum products during April-January FY23. Countries such as Brazil, Israel, the Netherlands, and South Africa have witnessed substantial growth in consumption of Indian exports, with petroleum products playing a crucial role. In their joint statement, the two countries said they had \"agreed to explore new long term contracts.\"\n\nThe two sides also agreed to explore the possibility for further increasing the supply of coking coal and the opportunities for exporting anthracite coal from Russia to India.\n\nCommenting on the energy cooperation talks, Kwatra noted that India's oil imports from Russia are not just an important feature of bilateral ties, but also \"a very crucial segment when it comes to the energy security of India.\"\n\nIndia has not only imported Russian crude, but invested in the Russian energy ecosystem, including the Sakhalin-1 oil project. \"The two leaders, when they spoke of cooperation in this sector, they did focus on how exactly to strengthen that partnership. In the similar way, how exactly India, including in particular through the government-to-government route, could also build partnership with Rosneft and other energy entities,\" the Indian diplomat said.\n\nMoscow and New Delhi also discussed expanding cooperation in the nuclear energy field. Russia has so far been the only foreign country involved in constructing nuclear power generating capacity in India.\n\nRussian nuclear technology has been instrumental in the construction of the 6000 MW Kudankulam NPP in the southern part of the country. The plant's first two units, each with a capacity of 1000 MW, entered service in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Two more units are nearing completion, and the construction of two others began in 2021. The project was extensively discussed by the leaders.\n\nThe joint statement also notes that the two sides agreed to continue technical discussions on a potential new nuclear power plant of Russian design with a more advanced VVER-1200 reactor (this model of water-cooled power reactor is supplied to nuclear power plants in China, Bangladesh, Belarus and other countries).\n\nMoscow and New Delhi also discussed localizing manufacturing and joint production of nuclear power plant components, as well as operating projects in third countries. India is already participating in Rosatom's project for construction of a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.\n\nDuring a tour of the Atom Pavilion in Moscow, the two leaders saw details of a range of different nuclear energy technologies and projects, including nuclear-powered ice breakers and floating nuclear power plants. Such plants, according to Putin, could eventually \"replace the oil produced around the world.\" Rosatom Director General Alexei Likhachev told Modi that Russia could offer small nuclear power stations to India with \"very deep localization,\" TASS reported.\n\nThe joint statement underscores that military-technical cooperation between the two countries has traditionally been the central pillar of ties. The two sides agreed to hold the next round of talks by the Intergovernmental Commission on Military and Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) which oversees strategic and defense engagement in Moscow, in the second half of this year.\n\nNotably, the statement mentions the changing nature of defense cooperation - in what seems like a \"response\" to allegations that India has been \"drifting away\" from Russia as its largest defense partner in terms of volumes of supplies. \"Responding to India's quest for self-sufficiency, the partnership is reorienting presently to joint research and development, co-development and joint production of advanced defence technology and systems,\" the statement says, adding that both nations pledge to \"maintain the momentum\" of joint military cooperation activities.\n\nAhead of the summit, Rosoboronexport, Russia's defense-export agency and part of state-owned Rostec defense corporation, announced setting up the production of 3VBM17 'Mango' rounds in the South Asian country under the 'Make In India' initiative. The 125-mm projectiles are designed for firing from the main gun of the T-72 and T-90 tanks deployed by India's military.\n\nRostec also announced that another Indo-Russian joint venture produced and delivered 35,000 AK-203 Kalashnikov rifles to the Indian Ministry of Defense. The joint venture was set up in Korwa Ordnance Factory in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, in 2019.\n\nRussia remains the largest defense supplier to India, though the South Asian nation has been diversifying its sources of military imports and technological partnerships, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). BrahMos missiles, co-developed by India and Russia, have emerged as a mainstay in the Indian Armed Forces, as well as a key military export item for New Delhi.\n\nEarly this year, a batch of BrahMos missiles worth $375 million was supplied to the Philippines. Other nations - including Thailand, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia - have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring the supersonic cruise missiles.\n\nRussia has also recently approved the draft of the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement. It is a mutual defense logistics pact that will ensure joint inter-operability between the Russian and Indian armed forces during military exercises, as well as in case of deployment for humanitarian and disaster relief missions.\n\n\"Agreements of this kind expand the geographic opportunities for peacetime operations for all participating parties. Currently, this is less relevant for Russia since its main efforts are focused on the military operation in Ukraine, but after the conflict ends, this agreement will be useful,\" Alexey Kupriyanov, head of the Center of the Indo-Pacific Region of the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO), told RT.\n\n\"It is possible that the provisions of this agreement will apply in the case of joint exercises in Arctic territories and waters of the Arctic Ocean. From the perspective of Indian military elites and the expert community, this is important because Delhi is concerned about increased Chinese activity in polar regions,\" the expert added.\n\nThe two countries also discussed the progress achieved in opening up two vital routes that could boost trade and economic engagement by reducing time and the cost of logistics and providing a secure alternative to existing maritime routes such as the Suez Canal. The two countries are working on implementing the Chennai-Vladivostok (Eastern Maritime) Corridor and the International North-South Transport Corridor via Iran, as well as using the potential of the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic.\n\n\"The Sides share approaches on building a new architecture of stable and efficient transport corridors, and pay close attention to the development of promising production and marketing chains in Eurasia, including for the purpose of implementing the idea of a Greater Eurasian space,\" the statement noted.\n\nIt emphasized, in what seems to be a veiled reference to the Chinese Road and Belt Initiative rejected by India, that the new routes will be developed following several principles - \"transparency, broad participation, local priorities, financial sustainability and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.\"\n\nLogistics and payment settlement issues remain the key obstacles for exporters in both countries. However, the new trade routes will not only boost bilateral commerce between India and Russia, but also provide New Delhi with greater access to the markets of Central Asia, Europe, and the vital Arctic Region, where Indian interests are growing.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi",

Putin showed that Russia is not isolated from the global majority. The significance of Indo-Russian ties increases as the international system is in transition from a unipolar one with the dominance of one superpower to a multipolar one where many countries of differing capacity and status have a say and a way in international politics. Both India and Russia are invested in the multipolar system. India is a beneficiary of this current conjuncture with strategic relations with Russia on one side and the Western countries on other, that it can leverage with both sides and play a facilitator to peace in these combative times.\n\nGiven the context of the Russia-Ukraine war, PM Modi's famous 2022 line \"this is not an era for war\" resonates further when he mentioned \"the Global South's expectation for peace and stability\" to Putin. This is echoed in the joint statement on the imperative for peace and solution through negotiations based on international law and the United Nations (UN) Charter and the joint condemnation of terrorism suffered by both sides. The Indo-Russian engagement is demonstrated in multilateral institutions like the UN, the BRICS and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\n\nThis bilateral engaged with trade and connectivity issues and had more on the plate than the traditional defence agenda. The Russia-Ukraine war put pressure on global food, fuel, and fertiliser prices that spiralled up. India has been able to circumvent this crisis because of its special relationship with Russia, a fact pointed out by PM Modi: India's imports from Russia in 2023-24 were about $66 billion and increased by another $20 billion in the first quarter of 2024, primarily because of oil and gas imports. This is because of the concessional rates India negotiated on account of western sanctions, which analysts have shown, saved Indian refiners at least $10.5 billion in foreign exchange between April 2022 and May 2024.\n\nIndian exports to Russia stand below par at about $4 billion, which means a significant trade imbalance that concerns both sides who are looking for correction. So, PM Modi has called for a broadening of the basket of Indian exports to every sector including agriculture, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and services. Trade targets have been set at $100 billion by 2030, which seals the vision for economic cooperation. Importantly, as Interfax has shown, 70% of Russian-Indian trade is carried out in their national currencies.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India's system of Vostro accounts that countries can operate in India facilitates the development of a bilateral settlement system using national currencies like the rupee and rouble, saving foreign exchange. It is in this context that the two leaders agreed to move ahead on an India-Eurasia Economic Union Trade and Goods Agreement and processes are being put in place to facilitate Russian investment in India.\n\nGiven the focus on connectivity, this visit also stepped up the process of vitalising various transport links like the International North-South Trade and Transport Corridor that links Russian cities from St Petersburg to Mumbai via ports in Iran. This route, now operational, cuts down transport costs and time significantly. The Chennai-Vladivostok maritime route, the North Sea route were also discussed at this highest level opening up Russia-India maritime links.\n\nDefence cooperation between the two countries involves Indian imports of Russian defence systems, platforms and equipment, transfer of technologies, joint production and export to third countries. India has been diversifying its defence imports and also seeking indigenous defence manufacturing. Defence imports from Russia have declined over the last decade from 62% to about 45% currently.\n\nRussia's cooperation with India on nuclear power is set to increase as two new nuclear plants will be added to the existing four. Space cooperation will continue as before as bulk is added to scientific and technical cooperation between the two. Several memorandums of understanding in areas like new joint projects in the Russian Far East where India has already invested in an oilfield earlier; work on elimination of non-tariff barriers; ironing out customs procedures; furthering infrastructure development and investment promotion only deepen economic cooperation and show the diversification and institutionalisation of a long and historic relationship between the two.\n\nThe argument that Russia's ties with China come in the way of India-Russia relations is largely untrue as both are mature and seasoned international players who know how to balance their relations without harming any third party -- just as India's strategic partnerships with the West do not stand in the way of Russia-India relations. Similarly, the US expressing \"concerns\" on Russia-India cooperation is an unwarranted warning.\n\nThe July 8-9 Moscow bilateral showed the camaraderie between the two countries at different levels as PM Modi was honoured with Russia's highest award, the Order of St. Andrew. Gestures like President Putin's commitment to send back some Indian nationals who had mistakenly joined the Russian war are signs of the interpersonal level of relationship that Indian and Russian leaders enjoy. The words of the two leaders for this cooperation as \"special and privileged strategic partnership\" and PM Modi saying Russia is India's \"all-weather friend\" have deep meaning.", "source": {"uri":

This surge marks a 60 per cent growth from previous years, underscoring the robust nature of the bilateral relationship.\n\nExpressing optimism about the future of Russo-Indian relations, particularly in trade and economic cooperation, he highlighted India's pivotal role in Russia's foreign policy strategy, affirming a commitment to enhance bilateral ties across various sectors on mutually beneficial terms.\n\n\"Today Russia-India relations have the nature of a special privileged strategic partnership. It is being confirmed by the numbers: following the results of 2023 the trade turnover between our countries grew by 60 per cent and reached 57 billion US Dollars, and in January-April this year it has already added another 23 per cent and got close to 18 billion US Dollars,\" Manturov stated, attributing the growth in trade to mutual interests and shared economic goals.\n\nHe pointed to the new Concept of Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation, adopted recently, which prioritises strengthening ties with India across all fronts.\n\n\"India holds an important place in the new Concept of Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation, adopted last year. In this document it is directly stated that we will further continue building up partnership with India, increasing the level and expanding cooperation in all areas on a mutually beneficial basis. We are planning to put special attention to increasing the volume of bilateral trade, strengthening investment and technological ties, ensuring their resistance to destructive actions of unfriendly countries,\" he added, emphasising resilience against external pressures.\n\nThe interview delved into the diversification of trade and the transition towards transactions in national currencies between Russia and India. Manturov outlined a broad spectrum of collaborative efforts in industries such as industrial sectors, fuel and energy complexes, information technologies, communications, and transport. He highlighted the modernisation of financial mechanisms to facilitate smoother bilateral trade, including advancements in banking and insurance sectors.\n\nLooking ahead, Manturov projected a continued acceleration of bilateral cooperation, driven by untapped potentials in sectors like shipbuilding, aircraft engineering, metallurgy, and digital technologies. He emphasised the importance of the Intergovernmental Russia-India Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technical, and Cultural Cooperation in steering these efforts forward. The upcoming session of the Commission, slated for the second half of the year, is anticipated to catalyse further collaborative ventures.\n\nResponding to concerns about trade imbalances, Manturov underscored ongoing efforts to bolster imports from India. \"High levels of political engagement and dynamic economic growth provide a strong foundation,\" he remarked, outlining initiatives such as the Free Trade Agreement between the Eurasian Economic Union and India. He also highlighted the development of viable financial instruments and support mechanisms for large-scale investment projects.\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister emphasised the importance of infrastructure development in enhancing trade links between the two nations. He cited the International North-South Transport Corridor and increased connectivity through direct cargo flights and regular sailings between Russian and Indian ports as critical initiatives. These efforts aim to streamline logistics, reduce costs, and expedite cargo deliveries.\n\nBeyond economic ties, Manturov emphasised the significance of cultural and humanitarian exchanges. He noted the growing number of Indian students in Russian universities, particularly in medical programs, and highlighted expanding cultural collaborations between museums and libraries of both countries. The mutual tourist flow, he mentioned, holds potential for substantial growth, supported by enhanced bilateral relations.\n\nThese remarks by the Russian First Deputy Prime Minister come on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia.\n\nUpon arrival in Russia's Moscow, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was accorded Guard of Honour at VNUKOVO-II International Airport. Russia's First Deputy PM Denis Manturov received PM Modi at the airport. Manturov and PM Modi shook hands and greeted each other.\n\nPM Modi was also ceremoniously presented with the Order of St Andrew the Apostle the First, called Russia's highest civilian honour by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Prime Minister was presented with this award for his distinguished contribution to the development of a privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India and friendly ties between the two countries.

On the one hand, Modi delivered a blunt message to Putin that a solution to any conflict cannot be found on the battlefield while on the other, he emphasised the robust and time-tested friendship with Russia and spoke about further deepening the bilateral economic and trade relations. The Prime Minister's remark that peace talks do not succeed amid bombs, guns and bullets was meant to be a clear message to Putin to stop the war in Ukraine. Making it clear that it was on the side of peace, India offered to contribute to ending the conflict in Ukraine. A joint statement, issued after the bilateral talks, said the two sides highlighted the imperative of a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, including engagement between both parties. Modi's sharp formulation this time goes beyond what he had told Putin at their previous bilateral meeting in Uzbekistan's Samarkand, on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, about two years ago. He had then told the Russian strongman that \"this is not the era of war\" -- a line that was later used in the G20's Bali declaration that November, and by Western leaders to press Russia to end the war.\n\nThe Joint Statement on the development of strategic areas of Russia-India economic cooperation set a new bilateral trade target of $100 billion by 2030. Last year, trade between the two countries grew by 66% and added another 20% in the first quarter of 2024. The two countries agreed to cooperate in key energy sectors, including nuclear energy, oil refining and petrochemicals and expanded forms of cooperation and partnership in the field of energy infrastructure, technologies and equipment. They also agreed to facilitate mutual and international energy security, taking into account the prospects of global energy transition. India's relationship with Russia has weathered many a global storm and remained resilient. Defence is the strongest pillar of the strategic partnership by far, with nuclear and space cooperation also occupying an important place. The Soviet union was India's main supplier of defence equipment during the decades of the Cold War, and even now, between 60% and 70% of India's defence equipment is estimated to be of Russian origin. The defence cooperation has evolved from a buyer-seller framework to one involving joint R&D, co-development and joint production. For India, the Ukraine war has been posing a daunting diplomatic challenge as it needs to take a nuanced position to protect its national interests without succumbing to the pressures of the West.", "source": {"uri": "telanganatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Telangana Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "telangana_today@telanganatoday.com", "name": "Telangana Today", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samarkand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Samarkand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrochemical", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petrochemical"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Modi-Putin-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718891", "eventUri": "eng-9718891", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

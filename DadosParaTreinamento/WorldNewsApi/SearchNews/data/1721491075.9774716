{"id": 237079322, "title": "Again, NCC warns subscribers against buying pre-registered SIM cards", "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission has again issued a stern warning to mobile phone subscribers against purchasing pre-registered SIM cards, highlighting the significant risks they pose to individuals, national security, and adherence to telecommunications regulations. In an advisory posted recently on its website, the telecom regulator emphasized that pre-registered SIM cards are often fraudulently activated using stolen or fake identity information, effectively bypassing the mandatory registration process. This illegal practice facilitates anonymity for criminals and leads to a myriad of issues including regulatory non-compliance, lack of accountability, reputational damage, service disruptions, increased operational costs, trust issues, and unwanted surveillance. \u201cImagine walking into a store to buy a new phone number, only to find out it\u2019s already been activated under someone else\u2019s name, and they have no idea! That\u2019s exactly what a pre-registered SIM card is. These cards have been fraudulently activated by someone else, often with stolen or fake identity information. This bypasses the entire registration process, creating a whole host of problems,\u201d the NCC stated. The regulatory body urged subscribers to ensure they register their SIM cards personally, remain cautious of dubious offers, and report any suspicious activity. \u201cThe NCC is committed to creating a reliable and secure telecommunication network for all Nigerians. However, this goal can\u2019t be achieved without your participation. By rejecting pre-registered SIM cards and registering your SIM cards properly, you become an active player in safeguarding yourself, your loved ones, and the nation as a whole. Remember, responsible registration practices pave the way for a secure and thriving digital future for everyone,\u201d the statement added. The commission reiterated that strict regulations require SIM cards to be registered to the actual user for security and accountability purposes. Using a pre-registered SIM card can lead to fines or penalties for non-compliance with telecommunications regulations, it noted. The regulator highlighted the potential impact on business operations. Organizations that use pre-registered SIM cards for official purposes face operational risks when these SIM cards are deactivated or flagged due to non-compliance, which can disrupt business communications and operations. \u201cStakeholders\u2019 discovery of organizations using pre-registered SIM cards can harm the organization\u2019s reputation. Stakeholders will regard the business as untrustworthy or unethical, leading to a loss of confidence and potential business opportunities,\u201d the advisory concluded.", "summary": "<p>The Nigerian Communications Commission has again issued a stern warning to mobile phone subscribers against purchasing pre-registered SIM cards, highlighting the significant risks they pose to individuals, national security, and adherence to telecommunications regulations.

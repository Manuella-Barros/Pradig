But we are not looking too far ahead, as we will be celebrating this win now. We need to let this sink in first,\" an emotional Padma told PTI.\n\n\"Feeling extremely happy with his performance and achievement. It's an ode to all the hard work that he has done throughout. Winning the Candidates was one of his dreams, and it's a huge feeling.\" While Tamil Nadu has produced top Grandmasters such as Viswanathan Anand, R Praggnanandhaa and Aravindh Chithambaram, it was Anand's World Championship clash against Magnus Carlsen here in 2013, which inspired him to take up the sport.\n\n\"While he was seven years old, he began playing the sport by seeing some family members play. The same year, he saw the World Championship contest between Vishwanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen, and it was then that he became inspired by Vishi to take up the sport,\" she remembered.\n\n\"The sport quickly became his passion, and we allowed him to follow it up. It turned out to be a good decision, as he has attained every small achievement step-by-step.\" Gukesh's journey wasn't easy as his family dug into their savings and also turned to crowd-funding to fuel his dream.\n\nPadma said that it was only after he became a GM in 2019 that the financial problems were taken care of.\n\n\"Financially, there were a few hardships. But that was sorted after he became a GM. While he continues to work hard, we are doing the same to be able to support him in whatever way we can,\" she added.\n\nBesides finances, Gukesh also stopped attending school full-time after class IV to focus on chess.\n\nAlthough it was a hard call to take, Padma thanked his school (Velammal Vidyalaya School in Chennai) for being one of his biggest backers.\n\n\"The biggest challenge was to decide between his studies and chess. We had to sacrifice (his academics), and it was a hard decision to make,\" she said.\n\n\"His school is the biggest supporter. Whenever he wanted to go to a tournament, they gave him home duty. Till now, whatever academics he has had, whenever he was free, he used to write the exams.\n\n\"In the middle, we had even thought of him pursuing his studies alongside playing chess. But from hereon, I believe it's full-time chess for him.\" However, the most significant sacrifice was made by his father, Dr Rajinikanth, who gave up his career as an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon to help his son realise his dream.\n\nRajinikanth had to stop his practice as the father-son duo travelled worldwide on a shoestring budget when Gukesh chased the final GM norm. Meanwhile, his mother became the primary breadwinner, taking care of the household expenses.\n\nPadma was also emotional about Gukesh's father giving up his career and hailed him as the one who helped the boy rise to this level.\n\n\"He is the one who has helped him reach this level, starting from the very small steps.

Padma Kumari found herself rushing to the Chennai International Airport in the wee hours of Thursday. Her son, chess grandmaster D. Gukesh, was back after a triumphant campaign in the FIDE Candidates, after spending close to a month away from home. His flight landed close to 30 minutes before the scheduled arrival time, leaving his family racing against time to see him emerge from the arrival tunnel.\n\nWhat she did not factor in was the crowd that was going to compete with her for time near Gukesh. Scores of camerapersons from local media, 100-odd students from Velammal Vidyalaya (Gukesh's alma mater) and a few chess aficionados sprinkled here and there.\n\n\"I was so happy to see Gukesh. I was searching for him in the crowd. He spotted me and broke through the gathering and came to see us. It was an emotional moment for us,\" Padma told Sportstar.\n\nGukesh's victory, which saw him become the youngest winner in the tournament's history, saw life coming full circle for this family.\n\nA few months ago, a few unsavoury results put his qualification chances in jeopardy. It was a setback that thrust Gukesh into a bit of a pit.\n\nWhen he secured qualification by virtue of winning the Chennai Grand Masters, the nerves settled for Padma. So, when someone like Norwegian former World Champion Magnus Carlsen (while appreciative of Gukesh's talent) did not show much confidence in the 17-year-old doing well in Toronto, Padma remained unfazed.\n\n\"Yeah we saw what Magnus said. To be honest, I never cared because we saw that a few weeks before the Candidates tournament. But our confidence was solidified the day he qualified. So this did not matter.\"\n\nAlso read | Of a hero's welcome, overnight stardom and a whizz kid's longing for his mother\n\nOn April 22, when a draw between Fabiano Caruana and Ian Nepomniachtchi's drawn game secured Gukesh's victory, Padma was not in the know. She prefers not to watch the matches live and waits for action to end to check out the score.\n\n\"Usually, I don't follow the games live. I wake up in the morning and see the results. That day, I thought if something good happens, my husband would call and tell me. I thought since the call hadn't come, maybe Gukesh had drawn and the tournament had progressed to tiebreaks. By 6am, my husband called. I immediately knew something good had happened. We spent a few emotional moments on the call taking it all in.\"\n\nA microbiologist working in a hospital in the city, the suggestion that a cause for celebration could derail her workday sounds absurd to Padma.\n\n\"His win was going on in my mind but I can't deviate from the tasks of the day. After I came back home for the day, I watched all his interviews and all the videos from there and I was really happy.\"\n\nGukesh's routine has moved from a chess-obsessed schedule to one that aims to find the right balance between work and play. He takes tennis classes, throws in some yoga and meditation to keep calm, watches some Netflix and makes time for his friends. | Photo Credit: Walusza Fotografia\n\nGukesh's routine has moved from a chess-obsessed schedule to one that aims to find the right balance between work and play. He takes tennis classes, throws in some yoga and meditation to keep calm, watches some Netflix and makes time for his friends. | Photo Credit: Walusza Fotografia\n\nPadma revealed Gukesh calls her twice a day usually when he's competing, once before the game and once after. Losses would drive Gukesh to ask his mother to spend some more time speaking to him and Padma is armed with inspirational stories of athletes and personalities from across the spectrum to help lift her son's spirits. Usain Bolt, Padma said, is one such source of motivation for her son.\n\nThese tales came in handy in two particularly delicate moments over the past few months. Once during the lull before Gukesh qualified for Candidates, where poor results had dented his confidence, and the other after his loss to Alireza Firouzja in the seventh round in Toronto. What also helps, she said, is an evolving level of maturity.\n\n\"When he was younger, if he lost a match, his performance would drop. He would be going through the motions of a tournament and a single loss would derail him. Now, there's an element of maturity that's come into his method. He has a process. He does a lot of meditation, yoga - all that is also helping him. We see the change in him as parents. He has learnt to recover from a loss quickly and he is coming back stronger too.\n\n\"When he was a beginner in chess, he would finish with a mono syllable - yes or no, one word answers. He's not really an introvert, but he's not used to socialising so much. Now, he is evolving in every manner. He's also started giving his interviews in a calm, mature and often eloquent way. That's something we are incredibly happy about.\"\n\nPadma sent Gukesh to Toronto with an incredible amount of confidence in her son returning with that world championship berth, a positivity even her husband found it hard to buy into sometimes.\n\nAlso read | Gukesh triumphs in 2024 Candidates Tournament with Calm and Steady Performance - Anand writes in 'En Passant'\n\n\"Something told me and Gukesh also firmly believed that (he would win). When he was struggling to make it to the Candidates, something told me that he would make it and do something big. He puts in an enormous amount of hardwork. There was a phase when he was so low when he had poor results and his Candidates qualification was still uncertain. At that point, he was determined to just make it to the Candidates. He knew if he'd come here, he'd work hard and make something of it. There was confidence in his eyes. I know my son by every inch and I saw that spark in him which made me confident about him winning.\"\n\nGukesh's routine has moved from a chess-obsessed schedule to one that aims to find the right balance between work and play. He takes tennis classes, throws in some yoga and meditation to keep calm, watches some Netflix and makes time for his friends. He has also learnt to be disciplined about rest and sleep, something that's made a big difference ahead of his Candidates campaign.\n\nGukesh is a 'clean slate' kind of guy. He isn't someone who needs a care package from home when he travels. He has opened himself up to the culture and ways of the places he travels to for competitions but relishes the chance to return home to his family.\n\nWhile interviews, sponsor commitments and other appearances are set to eat into the time he gets at home, Padma is planning a get-together for family and friends in the 10 days she has with her son at home before he flies out to Poland.\n\nCompeting in Warsaw in the first pitstop of the Grand Chess Tour will kick start Gukesh's preparation for that all-important clash against Ding Liren. There's much talk about the fixture being hosted by India, with Chennai emerging as a potential venue.\n\nThese conversations are a few steps too far for Gukesh and his family. For now, the unit will soak in their son's success, dive into the stories of his Canadian sojourn and the adulation that's coming with it before it's time to get back to life on tour once more.\n\nLatest on SportstarSRH vs RCB, IPL 2024: Royal Challengers Bengaluru thumps Sunrisers Hyderabad to end losing streakV.

Gukesh, 17, scripted history by winning the Candidates Chess Tournament in Toronto recently to become the youngest ever challenger to the world title, bettering a record created by the legendary Garry Kasparov 40 years ago. The triumph entitles Gukesh a clash against reigning world champion Ding Liren of China in the last quarter of the year.\n\nThe Chennai-based teen bettered Kasparov's record by quite a distance as the Russian great was 22 when he qualified in 1984 to clash with compatriot Anatoly Karpov.\n\nGukesh, on his return after winning the Candidates, told PTI, \"I think the way Dhoni and tennis great Novak Djokovic handle themselves under immense pressure, they are big-game players and always come out on top and bring out their best whenever needed. That is why I am attracted to them.\" While Dhoni, the former India and Chennai Super Kings skipper, led India to twin World Cup successes and five IPL titles, Serbia's Djokovic has won a record 24 Grand Slam titles, and has enough in the tank to win a few more.\n\nNorwegian chess great Magnus Carlsen, the five-time world champion who forfeited his qualification spot for 2024 citing the lack of motivation in playing the longer version of the game in the existing tournament structure, has been a motivation for several youngsters and Gukesh is one of them.\n\n\"There are a lot of things you can learn from him (Carlsen). Not just chess, but also the mental attitude. He has one of the best mentalities in the world in any sport, I would say.\" The champion Grandmaster added that all chess players would have felt nervous during their careers but, with experience, they learn to handle it.\n\n\"We all get nervous, and with experience, we all learn how to deal with it. Yeah, I guess some maturity and practice.\" Gukesh is looking forward to the challenge from reigning world champion Ding Liren and says his preparations will for the summit clash will start soon. The All India Chess Federation (AICF) is exploring the possibility of hosting the world title contest in the country.\n\n\"My training for the final will start soon, and I hope it will be very enjoyable.\n\nThe legendary Kasparov lauded Gukesh's feat in ther Candidates, saying the teenaged GM was \"the Indian earthquake in Toronto\".\n\n\"Kasparov is one of my heroes and one of the greatest chess players of all time, and to get a huge compliment and notice from him, it really means a lot,\" he said.\n\nOn cricket, Gukesh said he hadn't been following cricket lately but he was an avid sports lover.\n\n\"Recently, I haven't followed cricket a lot.

{"id": 231225904, "title": "Ex-gymnastics doc Larry Nassar allegedly pays gangbangers for protection with 'sexual favors'", "text": "Child molester and disgraced sports doctor Larry Nassar relied on gangbangers for protection \u2014 paying them in cash and \u201csexual favors\u201d \u2014 while he rotted inside a Florida federal prison, an inmate claimed. Around June 2021, Nassar, 60, was seen going into a cell at the federal penitentiary in Sumter County, Fla., with Mexican gang members, according to Grace Pinson, an inmate who did time with Nassar at the high-security prison. The cell had its door shut and windows covered while the men were inside, which is done either when inmates are having sex or doing drugs, Pinson told The Post in a telephone interview from Allenwood, Pa. where the now-transgender inmate is currently incarcerated. In Nassar\u2019s case, \u201cit was definitely not for drugs,\u201d she contended. \u201cLarry Nassar has decided . . . sucking d\u2013k is a better way . . . of staying alive,\u201d said Pinson, who was sentenced to 20 years in the clink for sending a threatening letter to then-President George W. Bush in 2005. The jailbird described Nassar, who sexually abused hundreds of gymnasts including Olympians Simone Biles and Gabby Douglas, as a \u201cscared little church mouse\u201d who only left his housing unit in the prison to visit the chapel. There, she would chat with him, including about his hired muscle. \u201cHe wished he didn\u2019t need those guys,\u201d she recalled Nassar telling her. \u201cIn some ways what they expected of him was worse than the idea of being stabbed and killed.\u201d During his five years in Coleman, Nassar allegedly paid \u201ca couple hundred dollars a month\u201d to the Mexican gang members for protection, Pinson claimed. The inmate insisted she learned about Nassar\u2019s hired protection from the gang members she hung out with in the prison. She claimed she also viewed a phone her cellmate had that was used by the gangsters to handle drug transactions and discuss other business. Pinson believes they were forcing Nassar to do \u201csexual favors\u201d as payback for violating little girls \u2014 \u201cto humiliate and degrade Larry Nassar.\u201d \u201cMaking Larry Nassar suck your d\u2013k in prison \u2014 it\u2019s a twisted way of paying him back for what he did to those women.\u201d The paid protection, however, wasn\u2019t enough to keep Nassar safe from a near-fatal attack last year, when fellow inmate Shane McMillan repeatedly stabbed the serial sexual abuser in his cell in July after Nassar reportedly said he wanted to ogle female tennis players at Wimbledon. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to risk your life for Larry Nassar for a couple of hundred bucks,\u201d Pinson quipped about the dirty doc\u2019s hired guards. The wicked doctor has since transferred to a federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa. Bureau of Prisons spokesman Scott Taylor declined to comment on Pinson\u2019s claims about Nassar. Nassar declined an interview request. Jose Rojas, the former president for the Coleman prison officers\u2019 union who retired in December, questioned Pinson\u2019s jailhouse tale, claiming that Nassar was held in a \u201cdropout\u201d unit that is considered safer than general population. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those places if you\u2019re an inmate, you want to go into that unit because everything is quiet,\u201d Rojas said, adding that believes he would have heard from inmates about gangbangers leaning on Nassar. For decades, the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports physician sexually abused more than 250 girls and women under the guise of providing medical treatment. A slew of prominent athletes, including Olympians Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, helped bring down the deranged doctor by coming forward with their harrowing allegations of sexual abuse. Nassar was sentenced to hundreds of years in prison after pleading guilty to sexually abusing young athletes and possessing child porn across a trio of trials.", "summary": "Child molester Larry Nassar was allegedly raped by gangbangers he hired for protection while locked up in a Florida federal prison, an inmate claimed.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/larry-nassar-allegedly-pays-gangbangers-with-sexual-favors/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/u-s-olympic-gymnasts-aly-81557024.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:40:31", "author": "Matthew Sedacca", "authors": ["Matthew Sedacca"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.249}

It also calls on Beijing to resume dialogue with the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.\n\nAlso Read | Same-Sex Marriage in Thailand: Senate Passes Landmark Bill, To Become First Country in Southeast Asia To Recognise LGBTQ Marriages.\n\n\"The President is going to do what he thinks is best on behalf of the American people, that's what I can tell you,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference on Tuesday when asked about China's warning.\n\nThe Resolve Tibet Act is a bipartisan bill to enhance US support for Tibet and promote dialogue between the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama toward a peaceful resolution of the long-standing dispute between Tibet and China.\n\nAlso Read | Juneteenth 2024 Travel Guide: From Texas to New York City, 7 Places To Visit To Celebrate and Experience the True Spirit of the US Federal Holiday.\n\nThe Act enhances US support for Tibet - empowering State Department officials to actively and directly counter disinformation about Tibet from the Chinese government, reject false claims that Tibet has been part of China since \"ancient times\", push for negotiations without preconditions between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives or the democratically elected leaders of the Tibetan community, and affirm the State Department's responsibility to coordinate with other governments in multilateral efforts toward the goal of a negotiated agreement on Tibet.\n\nChina is opposed to the Act and has asked Biden not to sign it.\n\n\"Anyone or any force who attempts to destabilise Xizang to contain or suppress China will not succeed,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday. \"The US should not sign the bill. China will take resolute measures to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" he said.\n\nChina officially refers to Tibet as Xizang.\n\nChina in April this year said it would talk only with the representatives of the Dalai Lama and not the officials of the Tibetan government in exile based in India.\n\nAt the same time, China ruled out dialogue on the Dalai Lama's long-pending demand for autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland.\n\nIn its talks with China between 2002 and 2010, the Tibetan side pitched genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people in line with the middle-way policy as proposed by the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has said he does not seek political independence for Tibet but seeks autonomy for all Tibetan areas which include Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces besides the current official Tibet Autonomous Region, a truncated version of Tibet before it was annexed by China.\n\nAfter a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and came to India where he set up the government-in-exile.\n\nRelations between the two sides strained further due to protests against China in Tibetan areas in 2008.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Relations deteriorated even more following the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising military tensions in the South China Sea and in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe high-level delegation, led by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul and including Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived Tuesday at the hillside town, which the Nobel Peace Prize laureate has made his headquarters since fleeing from Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.\n\nAlso read | China urges Biden not to sign Tibet Bill; expresses concern over US Congressional delegation visit to meet Dalai Lama\n\nThere, they met with officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet. Beijing doesn't recognize the exiled administration and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.\n\nAfter meeting the spiritual leader on Wednesday, the seven US lawmakers addressed hundreds who had gathered at a monastery just outside the 88-year-old Dalai Lama's residence, waving American and Tibetan flags. They told the crowd that a key focus of their visit was to underscore the Resolve Tibet Act, passed by the US Congress last week, and aims to encourage dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials with the hopes of finding a peaceful resolution between Tibet and Beijing.\n\nThe bill should now be sent to the White House to be signed into law by President Joe Biden. The bill is \"a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi said, eliciting applause.\n\nMcCaul, the Republican representative, said the bill reaffirms American support for the Tibetan right to self-determination. \"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here... but we did not let the CCP intimidate us for we are here today,\" he said as people cheered.\n\nHowever, the visit and newly passed bill have triggered swift backlash from Beijing. Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged Washington on Tuesday not to support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or China will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what these measures may be. \"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added, urging the US side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nAlso read | US Congress team to visit India to boost ties, meet Dalai Lama\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.

But you, the President of China, will be gone and no one will give you credit for anything,\" she said during the public felicitation program at Tsuglagkhang complex in Dharamshala.\n\nChina considers the Dalai Lama's spiritual leader a separatist because of his demand for autonomy for Tibet, occupied by Beijing in the 1950s.\n\nDuring her speech, Pelosi said the Dalai Lama would not approve of her comments against China. \"When I criticize the Chinese government,\" he (the Dalai Lama) said, \"let's pray that Nancy rids her of her negative attitudes.

Former Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi is part of the delegation that arrived in Dharamsala on Tuesday.\n\nDharamsala has been the seat of power of the Tibetan government in exile since the Dalai Lama arrived in India sixty years ago. Last Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 391-26 to approve the Tibet-China Dispute Promotion and Resolution Act, which the Senate passed. The bill would allocate funds to combat what it calls Beijing's \"misinformation\" about Tibet's history, people and institutions.\n\nChina on Tuesday urged US President Joe Biden not to sign the Tibet policy bill. \"The 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the guise of religion,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said. He also said Beijing was gravely concerned and urged the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Lama group and honor the commitments the US has made to China on Xizang-related issues. , a Chinese name for Tibet. Jian also urged the United States to have no contact with the Dalai Lama group in any form.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House said Biden was going to make a decision he believed was in the best interests of the United States. \"The president is going to do what he thinks is best on behalf of the American people, that's what I can tell you,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters when asked about China's warning.\n\nReferring to the legislation, Pelosi said the passage of this bill (Resolve Tibet Act) is a message to the Chinese government that the United States has clear thinking and understanding on this issue of Tibet's freedom. \"The listening to the head of our delegation and the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee was masterful not only in terms of the policy, but also in the process of getting it passed in the most bipartisan way.\"\n\nThe Resolve Tibet Act is a bipartisan bill aimed at strengthening U.S. support for Tibet and promoting dialogue between the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama toward a peaceful resolution of the long-standing dispute between Tibet and China. China. The law strengthens U.S. support for Tibet, empowering State Department officials to actively and directly counter Chinese government misinformation about Tibet and reject false claims that Tibet has been part of China since \" ancient times.\"\n\nThe bill also encourages officials to promote negotiations without preconditions between Beijing and the Dalai Lama or his representatives and to coordinate with other governments in multilateral efforts to reach a negotiated agreement on Tibet.\n\nHowever, Beijing opposes the law and has asked Biden not to sign it. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said anyone or any force attempting to destabilize Xizang to contain or suppress China would not succeed. \"The United States should not sign the bill. China will take resolute measures to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" Jian said.\n\nChina, which officially refers to Tibet as Xizang, said earlier this year that it would only talk with representatives of the Dalai Lama and not officials of the Tibetan government in exile. At the same time, China has ruled out any dialogue on the Dalai Lamas' long-standing demand for autonomy for their distant Himalayan homeland.\n\nDuring its negotiations with China between 2002 and 2010, the Tibetan side proposed true autonomy for the Tibetan people, in accordance with the middle ground policy proposed by the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan spiritual leader said he did not seek political independence for Tibet but sought autonomy for all Tibetan regions which include the provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan, in addition to the current official autonomous region of Tibet, a truncated version of Tibet before its annexation by China. .\n\nAfter the failure of the anti-Chinese uprising in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and came to India.

United States is with Tibet and human rights still matter. This is a message not only for Tibet but anybody who is aspiring for human rights and for freedom...\" Dolma Tsering Teykhang told ANI.\n\n\"All those who are suffering under the intimidation of China and the expansionist mentality of Xi Jinping, I think this is a very big message for them...\" the Deputy Speaker of Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile said.\n\nDecrying China's authoritarian approach, she said that Beijing is \"annoyed\" with anyone who supports Tibet.\n\n\"China is annoyed with anything who supports Tibet. We are here not to annoy or humiliate China...representatives and senators are here to support just the cause. So, when there is truth, you have a supporter and if there is any truth or when they rectify the wrong politics they are practicing in Tibet, they will also get a lot of support...\" she said.\n\nEarlier this week, the US Congress passed a bill urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed the bill 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', also known as the 'Resolve Tibet Act', and it now heads to President Joe Biden for a signature to become law, Radio Free Asia reported.\n\nThe legislation rejects Beijing's stance that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times and urges China to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nIt also urged China to begin talks with the Dalai Lama, who is the spiritual leader of Tibet, and other Tibetan leaders about how Tibet is governed. No formal talks between two sides have taken place since 2010.\n\nUpon her arrival in Dharamshala, former US House Speaker Pelosi said \"It's very exciting to be here.\" Incidentally, Pelosi had in the year 2022 visited Taiwan which resulted in ties between US and China entering a frosty phase.\n\nMcCaul affirmed President Joe Biden's intention to sign the 'Resolve Tibet Act', which was passed last week by Congress. The Resolve Tibet Act urges Beijing to re-engage with Tibetan leaders for a peaceful resolution of their governance dispute with China.\n\nThe US Representative expressed enthusiasm about the upcoming meeting with the Dalai Lama, emphasizing the significance of the bill passed by Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, China said on Tuesday that Beijing is \"gravely concerned\" over the visit of the US delegation to Dharamshala.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian addressing a regular press conference yesterday asked the US to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Group and to \"stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.\n\n\"We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honour the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. China calls Tibet by the name Xizang.\n\nThe visiting US delegation visited the Tibetan Parliament in exile and the Tibet Museum Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Gangchen Kyisjong in Dharamshala on Tuesday.

Michael McCaul and including Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived a day before in the hillside town, which the Nobel Peace Prize laureate has made his headquarters since fleeing from Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. India considers Tibet to be part of China, though it hosts Tibetan exiles.\n\nThe meeting with the spiritual leader is expected to focus on the Resolve Tibet Act, recently passed by the U.S. Congress, aimed at encouraging dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials that could result in a peaceful resolution to the dispute between Tibet and Beijing. The bill will now go to the White House for President Joe Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe visit comes as the U.S. and China have increased talks in recent months, in a bid to normalize strained ties. But news of the visit and the subject of the bill triggered swift backlash from China.\n\nAfter arrival Tuesday, the U.S. delegation met with officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet.\n\nHundreds of people on Wednesday gathered at a monastery just outside the 88-year-old Dalai Lama's residence, where the meeting took place, waving American and Tibetan flags in support.\n\nChina doesn't recognize the Tibetan government-in-exile and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, McCaul highlighted the importance of the bill, which he said demonstrates that \"the United States of America stands with the people of Tibet.\"\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged Washington to not support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or Beijing will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what these measures may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added on Tuesday, urging the U.S. side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has a history of engaging with U.S. officials, he has met with all recent American presidents -- from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama -- except for Donald Trump and he is yet to meet Biden.\n\nBeijing, meanwhile, has repeatedly asked the U.S. not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the U.S. on Thursday for medical treatment on his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.\n\nAP writers Krutika Pathi in New Delhi and Didi Tang in Washington contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com",

As US Delegation Goes To Meet Dalai Lama, Spotlight Again On China's Control", "body": "Dharamshala: As the Resolve Tibet Bill advances closer to becoming law to enhance American support for Tibet, a high-level US congressional delegation, led by Michael McCaul and comprising former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, reached Dalai Lama's Temple at Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday to meet Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and interact with representatives of Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), also known as the Tibetan government in exile.\n\nCTA believes the significant meeting highlights bipartisan US support for Tibetan autonomy and promotes dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama's envoys. The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in March 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, believes in a 'middle-way' approach, meaning greater autonomy for Tibet rather than outright independence.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian urged US President Biden to not sign the Resolve Tibet Act into law and accused the Dalai Lama of being an 'anti-China separatist' acting under the cloak of religion.\n\nDalai Lama, the 88-year-old Tibetan monk lives in exile in McLeodganj, a small and quaint hill station in the suburbs of Dharamsala in the northern Indian Himalayas. US lawmakers last week passed a bipartisan bill to enhance support for Tibet and promote dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama towards a peaceful resolution of the long-standing dispute between Tibet and China.\n\nIt now goes to President Joe Biden, who is expected to sign it into law. The visiting lawmakers, including Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, will have an audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, on Wednesday morning, a CTA spokesperson said.\n\nCTA officials believe the Resolve Tibet Act, once signed, is a powerful reaffirmation of the United States' steadfast commitment to the people of Tibet. Visiting House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman McCaul is an original sponsor of the bill. Supporting the bill, McCaul had said, \"The United States has never accepted that Tibet was part of China since ancient times as the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) falsely claims. This legislation clarifies US policy and highlights the unique language, religion, and culture of the Tibetan people. It directs US diplomacy to push back against CCP propaganda. In addition, it ensures Tibetans have a say in their own future.\"\n\n\"This bill stresses the need for dialogue between the CCP and other democratically elected leaders of Tibet. Any resolution must include the wishes and voice of the Tibetan people...Passing this bill demonstrates America's resolve that the CCP's status quo in Tibet is not acceptable and I can think of no greater message or gift to the Dalai Lama and the people of Tibet than the swift passage of this bill to get to the President's desk as soon as possible to help put the people of Tibet in charge of their own future,\" he said.\n\nThe US delegation visit comes two days ahead of a planned trip by the Dalai Lama to the US to undergo medical treatment for his knees. However, his office said there will be no public engagement, including public audiences, of His Holiness during the visit.\n\nEn route to the US, the 14th Dalai Lama will briefly halt in Zurich, Switzerland on June 22. As per the schedule, the visiting delegation will be briefed on the evolution, composition, and functioning of the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile.\n\nThe previous crucial meeting of the spiritual leader with the US high-level delegation led by Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues Under Secretary Uzra Zeya was held here on May 18, 2022. That was the sixth visitation of the successive Special Coordinators to Dharamsala. As per the CTA, in January 2000 Assistant Secretary Julia Taft became the first Special Coordinator to visit Dharamsala. In November 2006, Undersecretary Paula J. Dobriansky visited. In 2009, Undersecretary Maria Otero (then designated to serve as Special Coordinator), accompanied Valerie Jarrett, Senior Advisor to President Barack Obama, on a trip to Dharamsala. Undersecretary Sarah Sewall visited Dharamsala in 2014 and 2016.\n\nChina vs US debate on Tibet\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden is going to take a decision that he thinks is in the best interest of the United States, the White House has said, after China warned of \"resolute measures\" if the Tibet policy bill is signed into law.\n\nThe US Congress, which passed this month the legislation, also calls on Beijing to resume dialogue with the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.\n\n\"The President is going to do what he thinks is best on behalf of the American people, that's what I can tell you,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference on Tuesday when asked about China's warning.\n\nThe Act enhances US support for Tibet empowering State Department officials to actively and directly counter disinformation about Tibet from the Chinese government, reject false claims that Tibet has been part of China since \"ancient times\", push for negotiations without preconditions between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives or the democratically elected leaders of the Tibetan community, and affirm the State Department's responsibility to coordinate with other governments in multilateral efforts toward the goal of a negotiated agreement on Tibet.\n\nChina officially refers to Tibet as Xizang. China in April this year said it would talk only with the representatives of the Dalai Lama and not the officials of the Tibetan government in exile based in India.\n\nAt the same time, China ruled out dialogue on the Dalai Lama's long-pending demand for autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland. In its talks with China between 2002 and 2010, the Tibetan side pitched genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people in line with the middle-way policy as proposed by the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has said he does not seek political independence for Tibet but seeks autonomy for all Tibetan areas which include Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces besides the current official Tibet Autonomous Region, a truncated version of Tibet before it was annexed by China. After a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and came to India where he set up the government-in-exile.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news",

No formal talks between two sides have taken place since 2010.\n\nUpon her arrival in Dharamshala, former US House Speaker Pelosi said \"It's very exciting to be here.\" Incidentally, Pelosi had in the year 2022 visited Taiwan which resulted in ties between US and China entering a frosty phase.\n\nMcCaul affirmed President Joe Biden's intention to sign the 'Resolve Tibet Act', which was passed last week by Congress. The Resolve Tibet Act urges Beijing to re-engage with Tibetan leaders for a peaceful resolution of their governance dispute with China.\n\nThe US Representative expressed enthusiasm about the upcoming meeting with the Dalai Lama, emphasizing the significance of the bill passed by Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, China said on Tuesday that Beijing is \"gravely concerned\" over the visit of the US delegation to Dharamshala.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian addressing a regular press conference yesterday asked the US to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Group and to \"stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.\n\n\"We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honour the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.

Relations at the time deteriorated even more following the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising military tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe high-level delegation, led by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul and including Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived Tuesday at the hillside town, which the Nobel Peace Prize laureate has made his headquarters since fleeing from Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. There, they met with officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet.\n\nBeijing doesn't recognize said administration and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.\n\nAfter meeting the spiritual leader on Wednesday, the seven U.S. lawmakers addressed hundreds who had gathered at a monastery just outside the 88-year-old Dalai Lama's residence, waving American and Tibetan flags.\n\nThey told the crowd that a key focus of their visit was to underscore the Resolve Tibet Act, passed by the U.S. Congress last week, and aims to encourage dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials with the hopes of finding a peaceful resolution between Tibet and Beijing. The bill should now be sent to the White House for President Biden to sign into a law.\n\nPelosi said the bill is \"a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" eliciting applause.\n\nMcCaul, the Republican representative, said it reaffirmed American support for the Tibetan right to self-determination. \"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here... but we did not let the CCP intimidate us for we are here today,\" he said as people cheered.\n\nHowever, the visit and newly passed bill have triggered swift backlash from Beijing.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged Washington on Tuesday not to support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or China will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what they may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added, urging the U.S. side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has a history of engaging with U.S. officials, including American presidents - from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama - except for Donald Trump. He has yet to meet Biden since he took office in 2021.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the U.S. on Thursday for medical treatment for his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly asked the U.S. not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nWhile India considers Tibet to be part of China, it hosts Tibetan exiles.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"},

Relations deteriorated even more following the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising military tensions in the South China Sea and in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe high-level delegation, led by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul and including Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived Tuesday at the hillside town, which the Nobel Peace Prize laureate has made his headquarters since fleeing from Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. There, they met with officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet.\n\nBeijing doesn't recognize the exiled administration and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.\n\nAfter meeting the spiritual leader on Wednesday, the seven US lawmakers addressed hundreds who had gathered at a monastery just outside the 88-year-old Dalai Lama's residence, waving American and Tibetan flags.\n\nThey told the crowd that a key focus of their visit was to underscore the Resolve Tibet Act, passed by the US Congress last week, and aims to encourage dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials with the hopes of finding a peaceful resolution between Tibet and Beijing. The bill should now be sent to the White House to be signed into law by President Joe Biden.\n\nThe bill is \"a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi said, eliciting applause.\n\nMcCaul, the Republican representative, said the bill reaffirms American support for the Tibetan right to self-determination. \"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here... but we did not let the CCP intimidate us for we are here today,\" he said as people cheered.\n\nHowever, the visit and newly passed bill have triggered swift backlash from Beijing.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged Washington on Tuesday not to support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or China will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what these measures may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added, urging the US side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has a history of engaging with US officials, including meeting American presidents -- from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama -- except for Donald Trump. He has yet to meet Biden since he took office in 2021.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the US on Thursday for medical treatment on his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly asked the US not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nWhile India considers Tibet to be part of China, it hosts Tibetan exiles.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

No formal talks between two sides have taken place since 2010.\n\nUpon her arrival in Dharamshala, former US House Speaker Pelosi said \"It's very exciting to be here.\" Incidentally, Pelosi had in the year 2022 visited Taiwan which resulted in ties between US and China entering a frosty phase.\n\nMcCaul affirmed President Joe Biden's intention to sign the 'Resolve Tibet Act', which was passed last week by Congress. The Resolve Tibet Act urges Beijing to re-engage with Tibetan leaders for a peaceful resolution of their governance dispute with China.\n\nThe US Representative expressed enthusiasm about the upcoming meeting with the Dalai Lama, emphasizing the significance of the bill passed by Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, China said on Tuesday that Beijing is \"gravely concerned\" over the visit of the US delegation to Dharamshala.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian addressing a regular press conference yesterday asked the US to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Group and to \"stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.\n\n\"We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honour the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.

Michael McCaul and including Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived a day before in the hillside town, which the Nobel Peace Prize laureate has made his headquarters since fleeing from Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. India considers Tibet to be part of China, though it hosts Tibetan exiles.\n\nThe meeting with the spiritual leader is expected to focus on the Resolve Tibet Act, recently passed by the U.S. Congress, aimed at encouraging dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials that could result in a peaceful resolution to the dispute between Tibet and Beijing. The bill will now go to the White House for President Joe Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe visit comes as the U.S. and China have increased talks in recent months, in a bid to normalize strained ties. But news of the visit and the subject of the bill triggered swift backlash from China.\n\nAfter arrival Tuesday, the U.S. delegation met with officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet.\n\nHundreds of people on Wednesday gathered at a monastery just outside the 88-year-old Dalai Lama's residence, where the meeting took place, waving American and Tibetan flags in support.\n\nChina doesn't recognize the Tibetan government-in-exile and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, McCaul highlighted the importance of the bill, which he said demonstrates that \"the United States of America stands with the people of Tibet.\"\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged Washington to not support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or Beijing will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what these measures may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added on Tuesday, urging the U.S. side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has a history of engaging with U.S. officials, he has met with all recent American presidents -- from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama -- except for Donald Trump and he is yet to meet Biden.\n\nBeijing, meanwhile, has repeatedly asked the U.S. not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the U.S. on Thursday for medical treatment on his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Krutika Pathi in New Delhi and Didi Tang in Washington contributed reporting.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(PTI)\n\nA day after a bipartisan United States congressional delegation met with the Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamshala, the Tibetan spiritual leader is set to travel to the US on Thursday for medical treatment for his knees. It remains unclear if he will meet any US officials during his stay in the country. The visit poses questions about why former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers travelled to India to meet with the Dalai Lama, just a day before his scheduled visit to the US.\n\nPelosi after meeting the Tibetan spiritual leader on Wednesday said that the legacy of the Dalai Lama \"will live forever\" and nobody will give Chinese President Xi Jinping any credit.\n\nThe delegation is led by US House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul and has members including Pelosi, who is now Speaker Emerita, and prominent US Congressional members -- Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern, and Ami Bera.\n\nThe Resolve Tibet Act\n\nThe US Congress passed this month a legislation, the Resolve Tibet Act, calling for a peaceful resolution of the dispute over the status and governance of Tibet. It also calls on Beijing to resume dialogue with the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Resolve Tibet Act is a bipartisan bill to enhance US support for Tibet and promote dialogue between the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama toward a peaceful resolution of the long-standing dispute between Tibet and China.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is going to take a decision that he thinks is in the best interest of the United States, the White House has said, after China warned of \"resolute measures\" if the Tibet policy bill is signed into law.\n\nThe Act enhances US support for Tibet empowering State Department officials to actively and directly counter disinformation about Tibet from the Chinese government, reject false claims that Tibet has been part of China since \"ancient times\", push for negotiations without preconditions between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives or the democratically elected leaders of the Tibetan community, and affirm the State Department's responsibility to coordinate with other governments in multilateral efforts toward the goal of a negotiated agreement on Tibet. China officially refers to Tibet as Xizang.\n\nChina in April this year said it would talk only with the representatives of the Dalai Lama and not the officials of the Tibetan government in exile based in India.\n\nAt the same time, China ruled out dialogue on the Dalai Lama's long-pending demand for autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland.\n\nIn its talks with China between 2002 and 2010, the Tibetan side pitched genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people in line with the middle-way policy as proposed by the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has said he did not seek political independence for Tibet but seeks autonomy for all Tibetan areas which include Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces besides the current official Tibet Autonomous Region, a truncated version of Tibet before it was annexed by China.\n\nAfter a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and came to India where he set up the government-in-exile. Relations between the two sides strained further due to protests against China in Tibetan areas in 2008.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [],

Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and also included former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., arrived Tuesday in Dharamshala, a Himalayan town in northern India where the Dalai Lama, 88, has lived in exile since fleeing China in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul said after the meeting, according to Reuters.\n\nMcCaul said Tuesday that Biden would soon sign a bill passed by Congress last week that presses Beijing to resume negotiations with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders that have been frozen since 2010, and to address Tibetan people's concerns about their cultural, religious and linguistic autonomy.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" Reuters quoted Pelosi, whose 2022 visit to the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan prompted China to encircle the island with live-fire military drills after she left, as saying Wednesday.\n\nThe lawmakers' meeting with the Dalai Lama is likely to irritate Beijing at a time when the U.S. and China are trying to improve relations. Beijing views the 1989 Nobel Peace laureate as an anti-China \"separatist,\" which he denies, and opposes any contact with him by foreign officials.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that affairs related to Tibet were an internal Chinese matter and that China would take \"resolute measures\" to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\n\n\"We urge the U.S. side to adhere to its commitments of recognizing Tibet as part of China and not supporting 'Tibet independence,'\" spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular news briefing in Beijing. \"The U.S. must not sign the bill into law.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama is traveling to the United States this month for medical treatment on his knees, his office earlier announced. It is unclear whether he will meet with any U.S. officials during the trip.\n\nUntil the presidency of Donald Trump, the Dalai Lama had met with every sitting U.S. president since George H.W. Bush. Biden, who criticized Trump during the 2020 campaign over his failure to meet with the Tibetan spiritual leader, has not met with the Dalai Lama since taking office in 2021.\n\nThe lawmakers' meeting with the Dalai Lama \"seeks to compensate for the Biden administration's reluctance to speak up on Tibet,\" said Brahma Chellaney, a professor emeritus of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research, a think tank in New Delhi.\n\n\"The U.S. and India need to work together, including countering China's disinformation on Tibet and foiling its plan to install a puppet as the next Dalai Lama,\" he told NBC News in an email.\n\nLike the U.S., India recognizes Tibet as part of China, even as it hosts the Tibetan exiles.\n\nMcCaul said Wednesday that the U.S. would not allow China to interfere in the process of naming a successor to the Dalai Lama, who is believed to be a reincarnation of the Buddha, upon his death.\n\nThere is already a dispute over who is the rightful Panchen Lama, the second-most important figure in Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama and the officially atheist Chinese government identified two different people as reincarnations in 1995.\n\nActivists say the Dalai Lama's choice, a 6-year-old child, was kidnapped by the Chinese government days after being named and has been forcibly detained ever since.\n\nChina says Tibet has prospered and modernized under Communist Party rule, pointing to the construction of highways, high-speed railways and other infrastructure and the promotion of tourism.\n\nCritics argue that has come at the cost of the erasure of Tibetan culture, language and religion as Beijing \"Sinicizes\" the remote, mountainous region, which it annexed in the 1950s.\n\n\"Such infliction of suffering and oppression on the Tibetan people by the Chinese Communist Party authorities is unparalleled and unprecedented,\" Tenpa Tsering, president of the Tibetan government-in-exile, said last year.", "source": {"uri":

The trip comes days after the U.S. Congress passed a bill with bipartisan support that urges China to begin a dialogue with Tibetan leaders to find a solution to the long-running conflict.\n\nMs. Pelosi was quoted by the media as saying: The Dalai Lama will live a long time and his legacy will live forever, but you, the President (Mr. Xi), will be gone and no one will give you credit for anything. .The Dalai Lama will not approve of me saying this... criticizing the Chinese government. But I hope it will allow me today to say that change is on the way. As our colleagues have said, hope brings a certain faith and the faith of the Tibetan people, in the goodness of others, will make all the difference...\n\nMs. Pelosi also reportedly said that bipartisan approval of the Resolve Tibet Act sends a message to China that Washington has clear thinking on this issue.\n\nThis bill says to the Chinese government: Things have changed now, prepare for this, she reportedly said as she applauded Tibetans at an event Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe Resolve Tibet Act, which will pressure China to resume 14-year-frozen negotiations with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders, now needs only President Joe Biden's signature, according to media reports to become law. Reports from Beijing claim that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian has urged the US president not to sign the bipartisan Tibet policy bill passed by both the US Senate and by the House of Representatives.\n\nAt a public reception Wednesday after the meeting with the Dalai Lama, Mr. McCaul reportedly said that Chinese officials had sent the delegation a letter warning us not to come to Dharamsala. He said the United States stood with Tibet in what he called its right to self-determination.\n\nAmerica, beautiful, will support Tibet to remain a powerful force as always, the media was quoted as saying.\n\nIt is worth noting that historically the Dalai Lama, considered for centuries the supreme spiritual leader of Tibet, has always been chosen through a procedure rooted in the belief in reincarnation. The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, born in 1935 in Tibet and recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama, fled to India as a young man in 1959, following the failure of a revolt in Tibet against domination Chinese.\n\nBased in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, his current health condition is said to be worrying. It is for this reason that the choice of the next Dalai Lama is ultimately seen as a potential flashpoint between Beijing and the current supporters of the Dalai Lamas exiled in India, who had formed the Central Tibetan Administration, commonly known as of Tibetan government in China. exiled based in Dharamsala several decades ago.\n\nAttacking the Dalai Lama, Beijing, which refers to Tibet under the Chinese name Xizang, said on Tuesday: \"Everyone knows that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in separatist activities anti-Chinese. under the guise of religion. We urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Lama group, honor the commitments the US has made to China on Xizang-related issues, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world... Xizang's business is purely Chinese. internal affairs and no external interference will ever be allowed...China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development

Relations deteriorated even more following the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising military tensions in the South China Sea and in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe high-level delegation, led by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul and including Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived Tuesday at the hillside town, which the Nobel Peace Prize laureate has made his headquarters since fleeing from Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. There, they met with officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet.\n\nBeijing doesn't recognize the exiled administration and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.\n\nAfter meeting the spiritual leader on Wednesday, the seven U.S. lawmakers addressed hundreds who had gathered at a monastery just outside the 88-year-old Dalai Lama's residence, waving American and Tibetan flags.\n\nThey told the crowd that a key focus of their visit was to underscore the Resolve Tibet Act, passed by the U.S. Congress last week, and aims to encourage dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials with the hopes of finding a peaceful resolution between Tibet and Beijing. The bill should now be sent to the White House to be signed into law by President Joe Biden.\n\nThe bill is \"a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi said, eliciting applause.\n\nMcCaul, the Republican representative, said the bill reaffirms American support for the Tibetan right to self-determination. \"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here... but we did not let the CCP intimidate us for we are here today,\" he said as people cheered.\n\nHowever, the visit and newly passed bill have triggered swift backlash from Beijing.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged Washington on Tuesday not to support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or China will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what these measures may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added, urging the U.S. side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has a history of engaging with U.S. officials, including meeting American presidents -- from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama -- except for Donald Trump. He has yet to meet Biden since he took office in 2021.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the U.S. on Thursday for medical treatment on his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly asked the U.S. not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nWhile India considers Tibet to be part of China, it hosts Tibetan exiles.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Didi Tang in Washington contributed to this report.

This is a message not only for Tibet but anybody who is aspiring for human rights and for freedom...\" Dolma Tsering Teykhang told ANI.\n\n\"All those who are suffering under the intimidation of China and the expansionist mentality of Xi Jinping, I think this is a very big message for them...\" the Deputy Speaker of Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile said.\n\nDecrying China's authoritarian approach, she said that Beijing is \"annoyed\" with anyone who supports Tibet.\n\n\"China is annoyed with anything who supports Tibet. We are here not to annoy or humiliate China...representatives and senators are here to support just the cause. So, when there is truth, you have a supporter and if there is any truth or when they rectify the wrong politics they are practicing in Tibet, they will also get a lot of support...\" she said.\n\nEarlier this week, the US Congress passed a bill urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed the bill 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', also known as the 'Resolve Tibet Act', and it now heads to President Joe Biden for a signature to become law, Radio Free Asia reported.\n\nThe legislation rejects Beijing's stance that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times and urges China to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nIt also urged China to begin talks with the Dalai Lama, who is the spiritual leader of Tibet, and other Tibetan leaders about how Tibet is governed. No formal talks between two sides have taken place since 2010.\n\nUpon her arrival in Dharamshala, former US House Speaker Pelosi said \"It's very exciting to be here.\" Incidentally, Pelosi had in the year 2022 visited Taiwan which resulted in ties between US and China entering a frosty phase.\n\nMcCaul affirmed President Joe Biden's intention to sign the 'Resolve Tibet Act', which was passed last week by Congress. The Resolve Tibet Act urges Beijing to re-engage with Tibetan leaders for a peaceful resolution of their governance dispute with China.\n\nThe US Representative expressed enthusiasm about the upcoming meeting with the Dalai Lama, emphasizing the significance of the bill passed by Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, China said on Tuesday that Beijing is \"gravely concerned\" over the visit of the US delegation to Dharamshala.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian addressing a regular press conference yesterday asked the US to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Group and to \"stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.\n\n\"We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honour the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. China calls Tibet by the name Xizang.\n\nThe visiting US delegation visited the Tibetan Parliament in exile and the Tibet Museum Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Gangchen Kyisjong in Dharamshala on Tuesday.\n\nThis report is auto-generated from a syndicated feed\n\nComments", "source": {"uri": "indiandefensenews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "indiandefensenews.in"}, "authors":

Relations at the time deteriorated even more following the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising military tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe high-level delegation, led by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul and including Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived Tuesday at the hillside town, which the Nobel Peace Prize laureate has made his headquarters since fleeing from Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. There, they met with officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet.\n\nBeijing doesn't recognize said administration and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.\n\nAfter meeting the spiritual leader on Wednesday, the seven U.S. lawmakers addressed hundreds who had gathered at a monastery just outside the 88-year-old Dalai Lama's residence, waving American and Tibetan flags.\n\nThey told the crowd that a key focus of their visit was to underscore the Resolve Tibet Act, passed by the U.S. Congress last week, and aims to encourage dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials with the hopes of finding a peaceful resolution between Tibet and Beijing. The bill should now be sent to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into a law.\n\nPelosi said the bill is \"a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" eliciting applause.\n\n\"It says to the Chinese government: 'Things have changed now, get ready for that\", she added.\n\nAhead of the visit, China's embassy in New Delhi criticised the meeting, saying the Dalai Lama was \"not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\".\n\nMcCaul, the Republican representative, said it reaffirmed American support for the Tibetan right to self-determination. \"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here... but we did not let the CCP intimidate us for we are here today,\" he said as people cheered.\n\nHowever, the visit and newly passed bill have triggered swift backlash from Beijing.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged Washington on Tuesday not to support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or China will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what they may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added, urging the U.S. side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has a history of engaging with U.S. officials, including American presidents -- from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama -- except for Donald Trump. He has yet to meet Biden since he took office in 2021.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the U.S. on Thursday for medical treatment for his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly asked the U.S. not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The trip comes days after the US Congress passed a bill with bipartisan support that urged China to start dialogue with Tibetan leaders to find a solution to the longstanding conflict.\n\nMs Pelosi was quoted by media reports saying, \"The Dalai Lama will live a long time and his legacy will live forever, but you, the President (Mr Xi), will be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything... The Dalai Lama will not approve of my saying this...that I am criticising the Chinese government... But I hope he will indulge me today in saying change is on the way. As our colleagues have said, hope brings some faith and the faith of the Tibetan people, in the goodness of others, is going to make all the difference...\"\n\nMs Pelosi also reportedly said that bipartisan approval for the Resolve Tibet Act sends a message to China that Washington is clear in its thinking on this issue.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government -- things have changed now, get ready for that,\" she was quoted as saying to cheering Tibetans at an event on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAccording to media reports, the Resolve Tibet Act, which will put pressure on China to resume negotiations frozen for 14 years with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders, now only needs President Joe Biden's signature to become law. Reports from Beijing claim that Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian has urged the US President not to sign the bipartisan Tibet Policy Bill adopted by both the US Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nAt a public function on Wednesday after the meeting with the Dalai Lama, Mr McCaul reportedly said that the Chinese officials had sent the delegation a letter \"warning us not to come to Dharamsala\". He said the United States stands with Tibet in what he called its right to self-determination.\n\n\"America, the beautiful, will support Tibet to remain a powerful force as always,\" he was quoted by the media.\n\nIt may be noted that historically, the Dalai Lama, regarded for centuries as the supreme Tibetan spiritual leader, has always been chosen through a procedure rooted in the belief of reincarnation. The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, born in 1935 in Tibet and recognised as the 14th Dalai Lama, had fled to India as a young man way back in 1959 following a failed revolt in Tibet against Chinese rule.\n\nBased in Dharamsala, in Himachal Pradesh, his current health has reportedly been a cause for concern. It is due to this that the selection of the next Dalai Lama eventually is being seen as a potential flashpoint between Beijing and the current Dalai Lama's exiled followers in India, who had formed the Central Tibetan Administration, popularly known as the Tibetan government-in-exile based out of Dharamsala decades ago.\n\nAttacking the Dalai Lama, Beijing, which refers to Tibet by the Chinese name Xizang, had earlier on Tuesday said, \"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion.

political views", "body": "The Chinese foreign ministry says the Dalai Lama -- the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism -- must \"thoroughly correct\" his political views as a condition for contact with China's central government to resume.\n\nFormal talks between China and the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, and his representatives have been stalled since 2010.\n\n\"With regard to contact and negotiations between the central government of China and the 14th Dalai Lama, our policy has been consistent and clear,\" said Lin Jian, a spokesman at China's foreign ministry.\n\n\"The key is that the 14th Dalai Lama must fundamentally reflect on and thoroughly correct his political views,\" Mr Lin said at a regular ministry news conference.\n\nThe Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognise and views as a violation of China's constitution.\n\nYet China continues to chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries, including former US presidents, even though the Dalai Lama says he is not seeking independence for Tibet.\n\nThe 88-year-old, whom China sees as a dangerous separatist in a monk's robes, remains the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.\n\nUS politicians are currently asking President Joe Biden to sign the Resolve Tibet Act, a bill passed by the US congress last week and aimed at pressing China to secure a negotiated and peaceful agreement on Tibet.\n\nA group of US politicians, who met the Dalai Lama in India on Wednesday, said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor.\n\nWhile Washington recognises Tibet as a part of China, the bill appears to question that position, analysts say.\n\nThe high-level delegation, led by Republican Representative Michael McCaul and including Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday at the hillside town the Dalai Lama has made his headquarters since fleeing from Tibet.\n\nThere, they met with officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet.\n\nBeijing doesn't recognise the said administration and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.\n\nMr McCaul, the Republican representative, said the bill reaffirmed American support for the Tibetan right to self-determination.\n\n\"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here ... but we did not let the CCP intimidate us for we are here today,\" he said.\n\nThe visit and newly passed bill have triggered swift backlash from Beijing.\n\nLin Jian urged Washington on Tuesday not to support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law\", or China will take \"resolute measures\", without elaborating on what they may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Mr Lin added, urging the US side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world\".\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The bill should now be sent to the White House to be signed into law by President Joe Biden.\n\nThe bill is \"a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi said, eliciting applause.\n\nMcCaul, the Republican representative, said the bill reaffirms American support for the Tibetan right to self-determination. \"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here... but we did not let the CCP intimidate us for we are here today,\" he said as people cheered.\n\nHowever, the visit and newly passed bill have triggered swift backlash from Beijing.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged Washington on Tuesday not to support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or China will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what these measures may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added, urging the US side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThe Associated Press writer Didi Tang in Washington contributed to this report. Pathi reported from New Delhi.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has a history of engaging with US officials, including meeting American presidents -- from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama -- except for Donald Trump. He has yet to meet Biden since he took office in 2021.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the US on Thursday for medical treatment on his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly asked the US not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nWhile India considers Tibet to be part of China, it hosts Tibetan exiles.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [],

They are attempting something we cannot let them get away with,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"His Holiness Dalai Lama, with his message of knowledge, tradition, compassion, purity of soul and love, will live a long time and his legacy will live forever. But you, the President of China, you'll be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything,\" the senior US lawmaker said in a comment pointedly about Xi.\n\nPelosi and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers, led by Republican chairman of the House committee on foreign affairs Michael McCaul, held an hour-long meeting with the Dalai Lama at his residence in McLeodganj and also met senior officials from Tibet's government-in-exile.\n\nThe visit comes days after the US Congress passed a bill urging China to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to resolve the dispute over the status of Tibet. The talks have been frozen since 2010.\n\nThe bill, a copy of which was presented to the Dalai Lama by the delegation, rejects China's contention that Tibet has been part of the country since ancient times and urges Beijing to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama\".\n\nAddressing a group of Tibetans after the meeting, Pelosi said the legislation passed last week sends a clear message to the Chinese government.\n\n\"We have clarity in our thinking and understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet...We know that the Chinese government is up to. They must get the message, and this legislation sends that message and it will be soon signed by President Biden,\" she said.\n\nMcCaul said, \"This bill makes it clear that the US believes that Tibet has its own unique language, religion and culture. It has a right to self-determination. The bill also requires the state department to aggressively challenge Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda about Tibet.\"\n\nThe remarks come as Washington and Beijing seek to steady rocky ties, while India is engaged in a dragging military standoff with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has taken bilateral relations to a six-decade low.\n\nOfficials from the Tibetan government-in-exile earlier said the US visit and legislation will put pressure on China to engage with them as they seek autonomy for the region.\n\nCongressional approval of the bill is a significant breakthrough, said its leader Penpa Tsering, saying it would put pressure on Beijing to negotiate. But the Dalai Lama had always sought \"autonomy or a middle way, not independence\" for Tibet, he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beijing expressed serious concerns over the visit and urged US to \"fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group.\"\n\nIt also warned the US against signing the bill into law, saying \"China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\"\n\nMcCaul said the delegation, including Pelosi, had also received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning them against coming to Dharamshala.\n\n\"They repeated their false claim that Tibet has been a part of China since the 13th century but we did not let the CCP intimidate us, for we are here today. The Dalai Lama knows that this is not true, that Tibet is a part of China and the people of Tibet know that is not true. The US also knows that it is not true,\" he said, adding \"That is why we are here today, in defiance of that warning.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, and also including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, arrived Tuesday in Dharamshala, a Himalayan town in northern India where the Dalai Lama, 88, has lived in exile since fleeing China in 1959 after the failure of the Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule.\n\nI still hope that one day the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace, McCaul said after the meeting, according to Reuters.\n\nMcCaul said Tuesday that Biden would soon sign a bill passed by Congress last week that presses Beijing to resume negotiations with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders, frozen since 2010, and address the Tibetan people's concerns over their cultural, religious and linguistic autonomy. .\n\nA US congressional delegation met with the Dalai Lama on Wednesday. Leslie Shedd / AP\n\nThis bill says to the Chinese government: Things have changed now, prepare for this, cited Pelosi, whose 2022 visit to the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan prompted China to encircle the island with live-fire military exercises after his departure, as he said on Wednesday.\n\nThe lawmakers' meeting with the Dalai Lama risks angering Beijing at a time when the United States and China are trying to improve relations. Beijing considers the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner to be an anti-China separatist, which he denies, and opposes any contact with him by foreign officials.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Tibet-related affairs are China's internal affairs and China will take resolute measures to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\n\nWe urge the US side to stick to its commitments to recognize Tibet as part of China and not support Tibetan independence, spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing in Beijing. The United States should not sign the bill.\n\nThe Dalai Lama will travel to the United States this month to receive medical treatment for his knees, his office announced earlier. It is not yet clear whether he will meet with U.S. officials during his trip.\n\nUntil the presidency of Donald Trump, the Dalai Lama had met every sitting American president since George HW Bush. Biden, who criticized Trump during the 2020 campaign for his failure to meet with the Tibetan spiritual leader, has not met with the Dalai Lama since taking office in 2021.\n\nThe lawmakers' meeting with the Dalai Lama is aimed at making up for the Biden administration's reluctance to speak out on Tibet, said Brahma Chellaney, professor emeritus of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research, a New Delhi think tank .\n\nThe United States and India must work together, including to counter China's misinformation about Tibet and thwart its plans to install a puppet as the next Dalai Lama, he said in an email to NBC News .\n\nLike the United States, India recognizes Tibet as part of China, although it hosts Tibetan exiles.\n\nMcCaul said Wednesday that the United States would not allow China to interfere in the process of appointing a successor to the Dalai Lama, considered a reincarnation of the Buddha, after his death.\n\nThere is already a dispute over who is the legitimate Panchen Lama, the second most important figure in Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama and China's officially atheist government identified two different people as reincarnations in 1995.\n\nActivists say the Dalai Lamas' choice, a 6-year-old child, was kidnapped by the Chinese government days after being named and has been forcibly detained ever since.\n\nChina says Tibet has prospered and modernized under Communist Party rule, pointing to the construction of highways, high-speed railways and other infrastructure as well as the promotion of tourism.\n\nCritics say this has come at the cost of erasing Tibetan culture, language and religion, as Beijing Sinicizes the remote, mountainous region it annexed in the 1950s.\n\nSuch suffering and oppression inflicted on the Tibetan people by the Chinese Communist Party authorities is unprecedented and unprecedented, Penpa Tsering, chairman of the Tibetan government in exile, said last year.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA bipartisan United States congressional delegation met with the Dalai Lama Wednesday at his residence in India's Dharamshala, sparking anger from China which views the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism as a dangerous separatist.\n\nThis comes as Washington and Beijing have recently restarted talks after several years of turmoil that began after the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods under the Trump administration. Relations at the time deteriorated even more following the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising military tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\n\nDALAI LAMA SAYS HE WAS BEING 'INNOCENT AND PLAYFUL' WHEN ASKING YOUNG BOY TO 'SUCK MY TONGUE'\n\nThe high-level delegation, led by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul and including Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived Tuesday at the hillside town, which the Nobel Peace Prize laureate has made his headquarters since fleeing from Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. There, they met with officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet.\n\nBeijing doesn't recognize said administration and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.\n\nAfter meeting the spiritual leader on Wednesday, the seven U.S. lawmakers addressed hundreds who had gathered at a monastery just outside the 88-year-old Dalai Lama's residence, waving American and Tibetan flags.\n\nThey told the crowd that a key focus of their visit was to underscore the Resolve Tibet Act, passed by the U.S. Congress last week, and aims to encourage dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials with the hopes of finding a peaceful resolution between Tibet and Beijing. The bill should now be sent to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into a law.\n\nPelosi said the bill is \"a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" eliciting applause.\n\nMcCaul, the Republican representative, said it reaffirmed American support for the Tibetan right to self-determination. \"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here... but we did not let the CCP intimidate us for we are here today,\" he said as people cheered.\n\nHowever, the visit and newly passed bill have triggered swift backlash from Beijing.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, urged Washington on Tuesday not to support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or China will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what they may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added, urging the U.S. side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has a history of engaging with U.S. officials, including American presidents -- from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama -- except for Donald Trump. He has yet to meet Biden since he took office in 2021.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the U.S. on Thursday for medical treatment for his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly asked the U.S. not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nWhile India considers Tibet to be part of China, it hosts Tibetan exiles.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news",

The Oracle Nechung is a major figure in Tibet and is Dalai Lama's advisor.\n\nFormer US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, top Republican Michael McCaul and other members of the US congressional delegation arrived at the Dalai Lama Temple to meet with the Tibetan spiritual leader on Wednesday.\n\nThe bipartisan US delegation, led by Michael McCaul, the Republican Chair of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, was welcomed by officials of the Central Tibetan Administration at Kangra Airport in Himachal Pradesh on Tuesday.\n\nPeople familiar with the developments said that the US delegation was taking part in rituals inside the Dalai Lama Temple. The Oracle Nechung also made sermons at ritual.\n\nThe Oracle Nechung, also known as the State Oracle of Tibet, is a significant spiritual figure in Tibetan Buddhism. The Nechung Oracle serves as the chief state oracle and advisor to the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile.\n\n\"It's very exciting to be here,\" Pelosi said, greeted by Tibetan schoolchildren and officials of the government-in-exile. In 2022, Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan strained relations between the US and China.\n\nThe oracle's prophecies and advice have historically influenced significant decisions within the Tibetan government. The current Nechung Oracle, Thupten Ngodup, has served in this role since 1987.\n\n\"They are here to experience a different way of culture that Tibetans have...we are going to have the official get-together in the meeting...It sends (the message) that Tibet is not alone. The United States is with Tibet and human rights still matter. This is a message not only for Tibet but anybody who is aspiring for human rights and for freedom,\" the deputy speaker of Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile, Dolma Tsering Teykhang, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.\n\n\"All those who are suffering under the intimidation of China and the expansionist mentality of Xi Jinping, I think this is a very big message for them,\" Teykhang further added.\n\nEarlier this week, the US Congress approved a bill urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to resolve their dispute over Tibet peacefully.\n\nThe bill, called the 'Resolve Tibet Act,' passed in the US House of Representatives and now awaits President Joe Biden's signature to become law. McCaul confirmed that President Joe Biden intends to sign the 'Resolve Tibet Act', which was passed by Congress last week.\n\nAccording to a report by Radio Free Asia, the legislation rejects China's claim that Tibet has always been a part of China and calls on Beijing to stop spreading misinformation about Tibetan history, its people, and institutions, including the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe bill also urged China to start discussions with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, and other Tibetan leaders about Tibet's governance. There have been no formal talks between the two sides since 2010.\n\nThe Chinese government, while reacting to the visit, termed the 'Dalai Group' as 'anti-China separatist'. Its foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian while addressing a regular press conference on Tuesday said: \"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\".\n\n\"Stop sending the wrong signal to the world. We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honour the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" Jian said, using the China-given name, Xizang, for Tibet.", "source":

He would say, 'Let's pray that Nancy rids her of her negative attitudes.' But I hope it will allow me today to say that change is on the way. As our colleagues have said, hope brings a little faith and the faith of the Tibetan people, in the goodness of others,. will make all the difference...\" Ms. Pelosi said.\n\nShe also said that bipartisan approval of the Resolve Tibet Act sends a message to China that Washington has clear thinking on this issue. \"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, prepare for this,\" she told Tibetans at an event this afternoon.\n\nThe act - which will put pressure on China to resume 14-year-frozen negotiations with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders - is now just a few days away. needs President Joe Biden's signature to become law.\n\nMr Biden, unlike every American president since George HW Bush, has never met the Dalai Lama.\n\nTibetan officials, particularly the Central Tibetan Administration, or CTA, believe that the Resolve Tibet Act, once signed, will be a powerful reaffirmation of the United States' commitment to the Tibetan people.\n\nThe United States has long supported the Tibetan people's right to practice their religion and culture and accuses China of human rights abuses in the remote Himalayan region that borders India.\n\nBut confusingly, the United States also considers the Tibet Autonomous Region to be a part of China.\n\nMs Pelosi's stunning offensive not only strengthens India's position against China, it also comes as US President Joe Biden prepares to sign a bill pressing Beijing to resolve the Tibet conflict and highlights Washington's intention to prevent Beijing from intervening in the selection of the next Dalai Lama. Lama.\n\nTradition has it that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death and the current leader - who turns 89 next month - has said his successor could be found in India. However, China insists that officially atheist communist leaders will appoint the next Dalai Lama, in keeping with a legacy of the past.\n\nThe US delegation - led by Congressman Gregory Meeks (D-NY) - arrived in India on Tuesday and met with Tibetan officials, Buddhist monks and nuns and schoolchildren at Kangra Airport in the Himachal Pradesh. The visit comes before the Dalai Lama's visit for treatment of a knee disease.\n\nTheir visit is significant because it comes as Washington and Beijing strive to improve relations between two of the world's economic and military giants. China has already expressed its irritation.\n\nBeijing considers the Dalai Lama, Nobel Peace Prize winner, a dangerous separatist and said it was \"seriously concerned\" by the visit of the American delegation and the bill which will be signed by Mr Biden.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Tibet-related matters were an internal matter and that Beijing would take \"resolute measures\" to defend its sovereignty. \"We urge the American side to adhere to its commitments to recognize Tibet as part of China...\" a spokesperson told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nThe American delegation, however, remained unmoved. Mr Meeks said: \"China can express its displeasure (but) we will stand up for what is right... to ensure that Tibetans have freedom, (that they) can return to their homeland and retain their culture and their history. That's what's important...\"\n\nBorn in 1935 as Lhamo Thondup, the Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two and was enthroned in 1940 as the 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.\n\nHe fled Tibet in 1959 and has since lived in McLeodganj, a small town near Dharamsala.\n\nHe believes in a \"middle\" approach, that is, greater autonomy versus independence.\n\nWith the contribution of agencies", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "14th Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Tibetan_Administration", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Tibetan Administration"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

He has yet to meet Mr Biden since he took office in 2021.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the US on Thursday for medical treatment on his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while he is there.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly asked the US not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nWhile India considers Tibet to be part of China, it hosts Tibetan exiles.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"},

The Act urges Beijing to engage with Tibetan leaders and resume talks, which have been halted since 2010, to resolve their governance disagreement with China peacefully.\n\nPelosi said, \"...His Holiness Dalai Lama, with his message of knowledge, tradition, compassion, purity of soul and love, will live a long time and his legacy will live forever. But you, the President of China, you'll be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything.\"\n\n\"Dalai Lama would not approve of my saying that.... when I criticise the Chinese government, he says, let's pray for Nancy to rid her of her negative attitudes. I hope he will indulge me today to say that change is on the way. As our colleagues have said hope brings some faith and the faith of the Tibetan people in the goodness of others is what is going to make all the difference,\" Pelosi said.\n\nMeanwhile, China urged US President Joe Biden not to sign the Tibet policy bill, warning of \"resolute measures\", as it expressed \"strong concern\" over the visit of delegation to Dharamshala.\n\nBeijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, said it was seriously concerned about the visit and the bill.\n\nIt urged the U.S. lawmakers not to make contact with what it calls the \"Dalai clique\".\n\nThe Dalai Lama, an 88-year-old Nobel peace laureate, fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet. Since then, the Dalai Lama has been living a life in exile in India. Chinese officials, however, object to at any interaction he has with officials of other countries.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has met U.S. officials, including presidents, during previous visits to the United States, but Biden has not met him since taking office in 2021.\n\nHe is due to fly to the U.S. this week for medical treatment, but it is unclear if he will have any engagements there during his stay there.

She stated the Tibetan spiritual leader's legacy will endure while Xi's time in power will be short-lived. Pelosi's remarks come after the US Congress passed a bill supporting the Dalai Lama and Tibet's freedom. China expressed concern over the US delegation's visit, urging the US to recognize the Dalai Group's separatist nature.Former US House Speaker Nancy Peolsi who is part of a US bipartisan delegation, which met with the Dalai Lama on Wednesday launched a broadside against Xi Jinping, stating that while the legacy of the Tibetan spiritual leader will live forever, the Chinese President will be gone in a few years.\n\nPelosi who is on a two-day visit to India said \"no one will give credit\" Xi for anything.\n\n\"His Holiness Dalai Lama, with his message of knowledge, tradition, compassion, purity of soul and love, will live a long time and his legacy will live forever. But you, the President of China, you'll be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything,\" said the former US House Speaker.\n\nPelosi said that the Dalai Lama would not approve of her comment against the Chinese. \"When I criticize the Chinese government, he says, let's pray for Nancy to rid her of her negative attitudes,\" Pelosi said during the public felicitation programme at Tsuglagkhang Complex in Dharamshala.\n\nThe bipartisan Congressional delegation arrived in India on Tuesday and was received by officials of the Central Tibetan Administration at Himachal Pradesh's Kangra Airport the same day.\n\nLast week, the US Congress passed a bill urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed the bill 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', also known as the 'Resolve Tibet Act,' and it now heads to President Joe Biden for a signature to become law, Radio Free Asia reported.\n\n\"You heard our colleagues talk about this legislation that was passed last week. We had been fighting this for a long time and in the spirituality of His Holiness, with manoeuvring inside the Congress, we made progress. But it's different now with the passage of this bill (Resolve Tibet Act) because this bill is a message to the Chinese Government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi further recalled the visit of the Chinese President to Washington, DC where she told him that the US is \"objecting\" to what China is doing to the culture of Tibet.\n\nIn response, Xi said, \"You know what you're talking about, you should go there and see for yourself all the improvements that China is making in Tibet,\" Pelosi recalled.\n\n\"They are trying to erase the culture by reducing the use of the language. They are trying something that we cannot let them get away with. I'll be gracious to the Chinese people, I don't know that they're up to this, but we do know that the Chinese government is, and we do know that they must get the message. This legislation sends the message, the House and the Senate and soon to be signed by Joe Biden, the president of the United States...\" the former US House Speaker added.\n\nUS Representative Congressman Gregory Meeks who is heading the American delegation's visit to India too gave a strong response to Beijing's criticism of their visit, and said that the US is going to stand for what is right.\n\n\"China can express unhappiness if it wants. We are going to stand for what is right. What is right is to make sure that Tibetans have freedom. They are able to return to their native land and they are able to keep their culture & history...That's what is important,\" he said.\n\nSikyong Penpa Tsering of the Central Tibetan Administration said \"no one can really make China happy.\"\n\n\"The meeting went on for about an hour. His Holiness (Dalai Lama) speaks about the larger interest of the society...He appreciated the US Congress people for passing the legislation,\" Penpa Tsering said on the meeting of the American delegation to Dharamshala.\n\nHe further said, \"Who can make China happy? They have to look at the reality and the situation and understand it from a better perspective.\"\n\nThe US legislation, notably rejects Beijing's stance that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times and urges China to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nIt also urged China to begin talks with the Dalai Lama, who is the spiritual leader of Tibet, and other Tibetan leaders about how Tibet is governed. No formal talks between the two sides have taken place since 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, China said on Tuesday that Beijing is \"gravely concerned\" over the visit of the US delegation to Dharamshala.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian addressing a regular press conference yesterday asked the US to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Group and to \"stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

by US lawmakers to India upset China?", "body": "NEW DELHI: A delegation of United States lawmakers met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday (June 19) in India's northern town of Dharamsala.\n\nThe meeting annoyed Beijing, which urged the United States on Tuesday to \"fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique\" and refrain from \"any form of contact with it\".\n\nWhy is the delegation in India?\n\nThe bipartisan seven-member group of American lawmakers is visiting India to meet the Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe United States has long supported the rights of the Tibetan people to practice their religion and culture, and has accused China of human rights violations in the remote Himalayan region that borders India.\n\nA bipartisan bill passed this month by the U.S. House of Representatives aims seeks to push Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to secure a negotiated agreement on Tibet and spur China to tackle Tibetan aspirations on historical, cultural, religious and linguistic identity.\n\nAmong the delegation are the two authors of the act, titled 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act' or the Resolve Tibet Act, along with Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe delegation also met officials of Tibet's government in exile, which functions from India.\n\nWho is the Dalai Lama?\n\nBorn in 1935 as Lhamo Thondup, the Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two, and enthroned in 1940 as the 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.\n\nBeijing invaded Tibet in 1950, and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against its rule, since when he has lived in exile in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala.\n\nIt has riled China at a time when Beijing and Washington are struggling to improve ties, and India's relations with China have also been strained since a military standoff on their Himalayan frontier killed 24 soldiers in 2020.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is expected to sign the Resolve Tibet Act soon, in a bid to find a resolution for the dispute, although Washington considers the Tibetan Autonomous Region to be a part of China.\n\n\"This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the US Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" the chief of the US delegation, and one author of the bill, Michael McCaul, said ahead of his departure from Washington on Friday.\n\nWhat are China's objections?\n\nChina accuses the Dalai Lama of being a \"splittist\" or a separatist, but he says he wants genuine autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland.\n\nWhile Beijing has always objected to his meetings with foreign leaders, this has not prevented the Dalai Lama from meeting them, including US presidents, although Biden has not met him yet.\n\nHowever, the most contentious issue is the task of appointing his successor.\n\nWhile Beijing has said it has the right to approve a successor, in a move set to strengthen its control over Tibet, the Dalai Lama says only the Tibetan people can make that call, and his successor could be found in India. - Reuters", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Beijing criticized the visit, urging the US to recognize the \"separatist nature\" of the Dalai Lama. The visit underscores Washington's support for Tibetan rights amid strained US-China relations. The Dalai Lama, in exile since 1959, seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet. The visit is part of ongoing efforts to address Tibetan aspirations through dialogue.A group of seven US lawmakers visited Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, to meet the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, on Wednesday. This visit has drawn sharp criticism from China, which views the Dalai Lama as a separatist.\n\nChina's Reaction to the Visit\n\nChina responded to the meeting by urging the United States to recognize the Dalai Lama's \"anti-China and separatist nature\" and avoid any form of contact with him. Beijing's reaction highlights the sensitive nature of the Tibet issue in China-US relations.\n\nPurpose of the US Delegation's Visit\n\nThe American lawmakers' visit to India was part of a broader effort to support Tibetan rights. They met the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, in Dharamshala. The visit aligns with Washington's long-standing support for Tibetans and their cultural and religious practices, which have faced repression in China.\n\nThe Resolve Tibet Act\n\nThe US House of Representatives recently passed the Resolve Tibet Act, which aims to pressure China into resuming dialogue with Tibetan leaders. This dialogue has been stalled since 2010. The bill seeks a negotiated agreement on Tibet's future, addressing aspirations related to its historical, cultural, religious, and linguistic identity.\n\nMeetings with Tibetan Exile Government\n\nThe delegation also met officials of Tibet's government in exile, which operates from India. Among the delegates were Nancy Pelosi, former US House Speaker, and the authors of the Resolve Tibet Act.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, born Lhamo Thondup in 1935, was recognized as the reincarnation of his predecessor at age two. He became the 14th Dalai Lama in 1940. Following China's invasion of Tibet in 1950 and a failed uprising in 1959, he fled to India and has lived in exile in Dharamshala since. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nControversy Surrounding the Visit\n\nThe US lawmakers' visit has further strained US-China relations, already at a low point. The visit comes as India and China navigate their own tense relations, particularly after the 2016 Doklam and 2020 Galwan standoffs.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is expected to sign the Resolve Tibet Act, which supports Tibetan self-determination. Although the US acknowledges Tibet as part of China, the Act advocates for Tibetans' right to decide their future.\n\nUS Lawmakers' Statements\n\n\"This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the US Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" said Michael McCaul, the head of the US delegation and one of the bill's authors, before departing from Washington.\n\nChina's Stance on the Dalai Lama\n\nChina considers the Dalai Lama a separatist. The Dalai Lama, however, seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet rather than independence. Beijing insists on approving the Dalai Lama's successor to strengthen its control over Tibet. In contrast, the Dalai Lama asserts that the Tibetan people should decide his successor, possibly from India.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com",

The delegation visited the Dalai Lama's residence in Himachal Pradesh's McLeod Ganj, with the head of the delegation, Michael McCaul, saying President Joe Biden would soon sign a bill that aims to press China to resolve the Tibet dispute.\n\nThe Resolve Tibet Act calls on Beijing to resume talks with Tibetan leaders, which have been halted since 2010, to resolve their governance disagreement with China peacefully. The bill aims for the two countries to reach a negotiated settlement regarding Tibet. It also urges China to address the desires of the Tibetan people concerning their historical, cultural, religious, and language identity.\n\nAhead of the meeting of the American delegation with the Dalai Lama, deputy Speaker of Tibetan Parliament-in-exile, Dolma Tsering Teykhang said the visit of the US lawmakers show \"Tibet is not alone.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of US representatives, including Nancy Pelosi, arrived at Kangra airport in Dharamshala. It also includes Rep Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Speaker Emerita, Rep Gregory Meeks, Rep Nicole Malliotakis, Rep Jim McGovern, and Rep Ami Bera.\n\nOfficials from the Central Tibetan Administration welcomed the American delegation upon their arrival.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, McCaul said, \"We are very excited to see His Holiness tomorrow to talk about many things, including the Bill we passed out of Congress, which basically says that the United States stands with the people of Tibet.\"\n\nOn being asked if Biden would sign the bill, she added, \"Yes, he will.\"\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed the Resolve Tibet Act, which is now awaiting Biden's signature to become law. This bill challenges Beijing's claim that Tibet has always been part of China and calls on China to stop spreading false information about Tibet's history, people, and institutions, including the Dalai Lama. Additionally, it urges China to initiate discussions with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders regarding Tibet's governance.\n\nUS politicians have frequently visited Dharamsala to support the Dalai Lama's efforts to gain international support for preserving the language and culture of Tibet, his homeland nestled in the mountains.\n\nThe Dalai Lama escaped to India in 1959 following an unsuccessful rebellion against Chinese control in Tibet. Chinese authorities oppose any meetings he holds with officials from other nations.\n\nBeijing, which views the Nobel peace laureate the Dalai Lama as a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, on Tuesday expressed strong concern about the visit and the bill anticipated to be signed by Biden.\n\nForeign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, \"We ... urge the US to fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique, abide by its commitments on Tibet-related issues, refrain from any form of contact with it, and stop sending erroneous messages. We urge the US side to honour its commitment of recognising Tibet as part of China and not supporting Tibetan independence, and not to sign the above-mentioned bill.\"\n\nBeijing stated that it would

Lawmakers Meeting Dalai Lama In India?", "body": "The bipartisan seven-member group of American lawmakers is visiting India to meet the Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, 88, has said his successor may be found in India (File).\n\nA delegation of US lawmakers met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, on Wednesday in Himachal Pradesh's Dharamshala.\n\nThe meeting annoyed Beijing, which urged the United States on Tuesday to \"fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique\" and refrain from \"any form of contact with it\".\n\nWhy Is The Delegation In India?\n\nThe bipartisan seven-member group of American lawmakers is visiting India to meet the Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe United States has long supported the rights of the Tibetan people to practice their religion and culture, and has accused China of human rights violations in the remote Himalayan region that borders India.\n\nA bipartisan bill passed this month by the US House of Representatives aims to push Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to secure a negotiated agreement on Tibet and spur China to tackle Tibetan aspirations on historical, cultural, religious and linguistic identity.\n\nREAD | \"Dalai Lama Legacy Will Live, You'll Be Gone\": Nancy Pelosi To Xi Jinping\n\nAmong the delegation are the two authors of the act, titled 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act' or the Resolve Tibet Act, along with Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe delegation also met officials of Tibet's government in exile, which functions from India.\n\nWho Is The Dalai Lama?\n\nBorn in 1935 as Lhamo Thondup, the Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two, and enthroned in 1940 as the 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.\n\nBeijing invaded Tibet in 1950, and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against its rule, since when he has lived in exile in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nWhy Is The Visit Controversial?\n\nIt has riled China at a time when Beijing and Washington are struggling to improve ties, and India's relations with China have also been strained since a military standoff on their Himalayan frontier killed 24 soldiers in 2020.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is expected to sign the Resolve Tibet Act soon, in a bid to find a resolution for the dispute, although Washington considers the Tibetan Autonomous Region to be a part of China.\n\n\"This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the US Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" the chief of the US delegation, and one author of the bill, Michael McCaul, said ahead of his departure from Washington on Friday.\n\nWhat Are China's Objections?\n\nChina accuses the Dalai Lama of being a \"splittist\" or a separatist, but he says he wants genuine autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland.\n\nWhile Beijing has always objected to his meetings with foreign leaders, this has not prevented the Dalai Lama from meeting them, including U.S. presidents, although Biden has not met him yet.\n\nHowever, the most contentious issue is the task of appointing his successor.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nWhile Beijing has said it has the right to approve a successor, in a move set to strengthen its control over Tibet, the Dalai Lama says only the Tibetan people can make that call, and his successor could be found in India.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This Bill makes it clear that the US believes that Tibet has its own unique language, religion and culture. It has a right to self-determination. The Bill also requires the state department to aggressively challenge Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda about Tibet.\"\n\nThe Bill rejects China's contention that Tibet has been part of the country since ancient times and urges Beijing to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nMcCaul said that they hope that one day the Dalai Lama and his people will return to their home in Tibet in peace. \"Decades later, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continues to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people. They have even attempted to insert themselves into the succession of the Dalai Lama. We will not let that happen. Even after the violence and forcible removal from his homeland, the Dalai Lama continues to preach tolerance, peace and forgiveness,\" he said.\n\nHe said the delegation, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, had received a letter from the CCP, warning them against coming to Dharamshala. \"Our delegation received a letter from the CCP, warning us not to come here. They repeated their false claim that Tibet has been a part of China since the 13th century but we did not let the CCP intimidate us, for we are here today. The Dalai Lama knows that this is not true that Tibet is a part of China and the people of Tibet know that is not true. The US also knows that it is not true,\" McCaul said.\n\nHe said that the Tibetan people should have a say in their own future. \"You should be able to freely practice your religion. That is why we are here today, in defiance of that warning,\" he said.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed a Bill on June 12 urging China to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to resolve the dispute over the status of Tibet.\n\nNancy Pelosi accuses China of erasing Tibetan culture\n\nPelosi, who described her meeting with the Dalai Lama as a blessing, said that the legislation passed last week sends a clear message to the Chinese government. \"We have clarity in our thinking and understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet. \"When we went to Tibet, we saw ourselves. We saw the Potala Palace and the room where His Holiness grew up, his bedroom, which remains there for his return. I can tell you this: They (Chinese government) are trying to erase the culture, reduce the use of the language. They are attempting something we cannot let them get away with,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that the Chinese government is up to. They must get the message, and this legislation sends that message and it will be soon signed by President Biden. In Tibet, they are trying to educate the children in the Chinese way to diminish their knowledge of the Tibetan language and have surveillance on everything families there do. We just cannot let this happen.\"\n\nSignificant breakthrough: Penpa Tsering\n\nCongressional approval of the Bill is a significant breakthrough, said Penpa Tsering, the political leader of the exiled Tibetan government, who believed it would put pressure on Beijing to negotiate.

He would say, 'Let's pray for Nancy to rid her of negative attitudes.' But I hope he will indulge me today in saying change is on the way. As our colleagues have said, hope brings some faith and the faith of the Tibetan people, in the goodness of others, is going to make all the difference...\" Ms Pelosi said.\n\nShe also said that bipartisan approval for the Resolve Tibet Act sends a message to China - that Washington is clear in its thinking on this issue. \"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" she said to cheering Tibetans at an event this afternoon.\n\nThe act - which will put pressure on China to resume negotiations, frozen for 14 years, with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders - now only needs President Joe Biden's signature to become law.\n\nMr Biden, unlike every US President since George HW Bush, has never met the Dalai Lama.\n\nTibetan officials, specifically the Central Tibetan Administration, or CTA, believe the Resolve Tibet Act, once signed, will stand as a powerful reaffirmation of the US' commitment to the people of Tibet.\n\nMs Pelosi's stunning broadside not only boosts to India's position against China, it also comes as US President Joe Biden is set to sign a bill pressing Beijing to resolve the Tibet dispute and underlines Washington's intention to stop Beijing from intervening in the selection of the next Dalai Lama.\n\nTradition dictates the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death and the current leader - who will turn 89 next month - has said his successor may be found in India. However, China insists officially atheist Communist leaders will name the next Dalai Lama, in line with a legacy from the past.\n\nThe current Dalai Lama is 88 years old (File).\n\nThe US delegation - led by Congressman Gregory Meeks (D-New York) - reached India Tuesday, and was met Tibetan officials, Buddhist monks and nun, and school children at Himachal Pradesh's Kangra airport. The visit comes before the Dalai Lama's visit for treatment for a knee condition.\n\nTheir visit is significant because it comes as Washington and Beijing work to improve relations between two of the world's economic and military giants. China has already expressed irritation.\n\nBeijing considers the Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace laureate, a dangerous separatist, and has said it is \"seriously concerned\" by the American delegation's visit and the bill to be signed by Mr Biden.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday affairs related to Tibet were an internal matter and that Beijing would take \"resolute measures\" to defend its sovereignty. \"We urge the US side to adhere to commitments of recognising Tibet as part of China...\" a spokesperson told press in Beijing Tuesday.\n\nThe US delegation, however, appeared unmoved. Mr Meeks said, \"China can express its unhappiness (but) we are going to stand for what is right... to make sure Tibetans have freedom, (that) they can return to their native land and keep their culture and history. That is what is important...\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959, believes in a 'middle-way' approach, meaning greater autonomy over independence. Since his exile, he lives in McLeodganj, a small town near Dharamsala.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nWith input from agencies\n\nNDTV is now available on WhatsApp channels.

EXPLAINED", "body": "A bipartisan US congressional delegation, led by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaulis, is visiting India to strengthen bilateral ties and to meet the 88-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader.\n\nA delegation of US lawmakers met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday in India's northern town of Dharamsala. The meeting annoyed Beijing, which urged the United States on Tuesday to \"fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique\" and refrain from \"any form of contact with it\".\n\nThe bipartisan seven-member group of American lawmakers is visiting India to meet the Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama. The United States has long supported the rights of the Tibetan people to practice their religion and culture, and has accused China of human rights violations in the remote Himalayan region that borders India. A bipartisan bill passed this month by the US House of Representatives aims to push Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to secure a negotiated agreement on Tibet and spur China to tackle Tibetan aspirations on historical, cultural, religious and linguistic identity. Among the delegation are the two authors of the act, titled 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act' or the Resolve Tibet Act, along with Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the US House of Representatives. The delegation also met officials of Tibet's government in exile, which functions from India.\n\nBorn in 1935 as Lhamo Thondup, the Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two, and enthroned in 1940 as the 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. Beijing invaded Tibet in 1950, and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against its rule, since when he has lived in exile in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nIt has riled China at a time when Beijing and Washington are struggling to improve ties, and India's relations with China have also been strained since a military standoff on their Himalayan frontier killed 24 soldiers in 2020. US President Joe Biden is expected to sign the Resolve Tibet Act soon, in a bid to find a resolution for the dispute, although Washington considers the Tibetan Autonomous Region to be a part of China.\n\n\"This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the US Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" the chief of the U.S. delegation, and one author of the bill, Michael McCaul, said ahead of his departure from Washington on Friday.\n\nChina accuses the Dalai Lama of being a \"splittist\" or a separatist, but he says he wants genuine autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland. While Beijing has always objected to his meetings with foreign leaders, this has not prevented the Dalai Lama from meeting them, including US presidents, although Biden has not met him yet. However, the most contentious issue is the task of appointing his successor. While Beijing has said it has the right to approve a successor, in a move set to strengthen its control over Tibet, the Dalai Lama says only the Tibetan people can make that call, and his successor could be found in India.\n\n(With inputs from agency)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajit_kumar@indiatvnews.com", "name":

He has yet to meet Mr Biden since he took office in 2021.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the US on Thursday for medical treatment on his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while he is there.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly asked the US not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic

It is not about a religious or political cause, but about the rights of the people to preserve their culture, language, and identity. The Tibetan struggle is a struggle for human rights and dignity.\"\n\nThe copy of the Resolve Tibet Act was presented by the Congressional delegation led by Chairman Michael McCaul, Nicole Malliotakis, Gregory W Meeks, Jim McGovern, Ami Bera, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, besides Pelosi, who were seen waving American and Tibetan flags.\n\nThe bipartisan delegation flew into Dharamsala on Tuesday to meet the 88-year-old Nobel peace laureate and other top officials of the Tibetan government-in-exile.\n\nCentral Tibetan Administration (CTA) President Penpa Tsering said, \"Grateful for your instrumental leadership in sponsoring and ensuring the passage of the Resolve Tibet Act in the US Congress. We are just one step away from this becoming a law, which will significantly add value to the middle-way policy advocated by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the CTA.\"\n\nAt the felicitation ceremony, Republican representative McCaul said the Bill reaffirms America's support for the Tibetan right to self-determination.\n\n\"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here... But we did not let the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) intimidate us for we are here today,\" McCaul said.\n\nBeijing, which considers the Dalai Lama a 'separatist', had said that it was seriously concerned about the visit of the US lawmakers to Dharamsala.\n\nThe US delegation visit came a day ahead of a planned trip by the Dalai Lama to the US to undergo medical treatment for his knees. However, his office told IANS that there will be no public engagement, including public audiences, of the Dalai Lama during the visit.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has been living in self-imposed exile in India

It urged the US to respect its stance on Tibet. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian emphasised the need for the Dalai Lama to reflect and correct his political views. The US Congressional delegation's visit to Dharamsala and meeting with the Dalai Lama prompted strong remarks questioning China's Tibet policy. China criticised the US for engaging with the Dalai Lama and urged other countries to refrain from supporting the Tibet government-in-exile. China on Thursday asked the Dalai Lama to thoroughly reflect and completely correct his political propositions for it to hold talks with him and asked the US to respect its sensitivity and importance to Tibet-related issues as Washington is set to pass a tough Tibet policy law. On the central government's contact and talks with the 14th Dalai Lama China's policy is consistent and clear, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a media briefing.\n\nThe key is that the 14th Dalai Lama must thoroughly reflect on and completely correct his political propositions, he said, without elaborating.\n\nChina watched warily the high-powered US Congressional delegation's visit to Dharamsala and its meeting with the 88-year-old Dalai Lama besides the strong remarks made by its leading members US House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Michael McCaul and former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioning China's policy towards Tibet and their call to Beijing to hold talks with the Dalai Lama.\n\nTheir visit came as US President Joe Biden was set to sign the Tibet policy bill adopted by both the US Senate and the House of Representatives. The bill awaits Biden's signature to make it into law.\n\nThe bill seeks to counter China's narrative about its control over Tibet and promote dialogue between the Chinese government and the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who is based in India since he fled the Himalayan region in 1959.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beijing urged Biden not to sign the Tibet policy bill, warning of \"resolute measures\".\n\nOn the US delegation's visit to Dharamsala and its talks with the Dalai Lama, Lin said, \"We urge the US to clearly see the sensitivity and importance of Xizang-related issues and earnestly respect China's core interests on its comments on Xizang, refrain from any forms with the Dalai group and stop sending out to the world wrong signals.\"\n\nHe also criticised the reported remarks by the Tibet government-in-exile that it is going to use the new Tibet legislation passed by the US Senate and Congress to try to force China to come to the negotiating table and urge other countries to put pressure on Beijing to hold talks with it.\n\n\"The so-called Tibet government-in-exile is an out-and-out separatist political group and an illegal organisation in total violation of China's constitution and laws. It is not recognised by any country,\" Lin said.\n\nAfter the US Congressional talks with the Dalai Lama, McCaul said on Wednesday that the Tibetans have the right to self-determination and should be allowed to practise their religion freely.\n\nAt a felicitation ceremony held after the seven US Congress members met the Tibetan leader, McCaul said the delegation had defied a warning from the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\"The Tibetan people possess a distant religion, culture and historic identity and they should have a say in their own future. You should be able to freely practise your religion and that is why we are here today in defiance of the CCP (Communist Party of China) warning,\" he said.\n\n\"Our delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here. They repeated their false claim that Tibet is part of China since the 13th century but we did not let the CCP intimidate us and we are here today,\" he said at the event organised by the Dharamsala-based Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).\n\nHe added that the Dalai Lama, the people of Tibet and the US know that Tibet is not part of China.\n\nThe US delegation included Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera.\n\nAt his residence, the Dalai Lama told them that he wanted the people of the world to be happy and peaceful.\n\nReferring to the Tibet policy bill, McCaul said at the later event that the timing of the visit could not be better. The bill also required aggressively challenging the CCP propaganda on Tibet, he added.\n\n\"I presented the Dalai Lama with a wind chime, which will remind him of our support,\" he said.\n\n\"Like many of you, I wish that this meeting was happening in your homeland of Tibet, but 65 years ago you were forced to flee after the Chinese Communist Party annexed Tibet and slaughtered tens of thousands of Tibetan people,\" he said.\n\nThe delegation leader claimed that the CCP was determined to eliminate Tibetan culture and forcibly bring the Tibetan people under its control.\n\nThanks to the kindness of the Indian people, the Tibetans who fled their homeland are able to live freely in this country and practise their religion without fear of persecution.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day His Holiness the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul said.\n\nHe said the CCP continued to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people decades later, and accused China of interfering with the process of finding a successor to the Dalai Lama.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [],

They also indicated that the U.S. would pressure China to resume talks with Tibetan leaders. This move could disrupt U.S.-China relations and potentially influence global policies on the Tibet issue.\n\nA group of U.S. lawmakers who met the Dalai Lama in India on Wednesday said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor, comments expected to anger Beijing, which calls the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader a separatist. The remarks come as Washington and Beijing seek to steady rocky ties while India pushes China to secure lasting peace on their disputed Himalayan frontier, four years after a military clash strained ties.\n\nThe lawmakers also signalled that Washington would pressure Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to resolve the Tibet issue, with a bill they said President Joe Biden would sign soon. Although Washington recognises Tibet as a part of China, the bill appears to question that position and any change would be a major shock to Beijing, analysts said. The bipartisan group of seven, led by Michael McCaul, a Republican representative from Texas, who also chairs the House foreign affairs committee, met the Nobel peace laureate at his monastery in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul told a public reception after the meeting. Beijing has even attempted to insert itself into choosing the successor of the Dalai Lama, he said, but added, \"We will not let that happen.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet. The 88-year-old, who has battled health problems for years, is set to fly to the United States this week for medical treatment. The question of the Dalai Lama's successor has been a thorny issue, which analysts say highlights the power and influence of the role, fuelling Beijing's tussle to control it.\n\nTibetan tradition holds that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death, and the current leader has said his successor may be found in India. Beijing has said the tradition must continue but its officially atheist Communist leaders have the right to approve the successor, as a legacy inherited from China's emperors.\n\nTIBETANS HAIL BREAKTHROUGH The U.S. group, which includes Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday for a two-day visit.\n\nPelosi said Congress approval of the legislation, titled \"Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act\", or the Resolve Tibet Act, sent a message to China that Washington was clear in its thinking on the issue of Tibet. \"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" she said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans at Wednesday's event.\n\nPhotographs on the Dalai Lama's website showed him holding a framed copy of the bill as the lawmakers stood alongside. Beijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, has said it was seriously concerned about the bill and the lawmakers' visit, urging them not to contact what it calls the \"Dalai clique\" and Biden not to sign the bill.\n\nThe Indian foreign ministry offered no immediate comment on the lawmakers' visit. Ties between the Asian rivals have been strained over their long mountainous border since army clashes in 2020 killed 20 Indian and four Chinese troops.\n\nAt the same time, concerns about China's growing might, among others, have nudged New Delhi and Washington closer in the last two decades. While Chinese officials chafe at any interactions of the Dalai Lama with officials of other countries, Biden has not met the Tibetan leader since taking office in 2021 and it is not clear if his treatment plans will allow time for engagements.\n\n\"Presidential assent for the bill would be far more concerning for China than whether Biden or any other leader meets the Dalai Lama,\" said Tibet specialist Robert Barnett of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). Congressional approval of the bill was a \"significant breakthrough\", Penpa Tsering, the political leader of the exiled Tibetan government, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nHe said he believed it would put pressure on Beijing to negotiate and that it could serve as a precedent for other nations to adopt similar policies to Washington. \"This will give us a tool to work with other governments,\" he said in his office in Dharamsala.\n\nBut the Dalai Lama had always sought \"autonomy or a middle way, not independence\" for Tibet, he added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

Beijing occupied Tibet in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Tibetan rule, where he lived in exile in the Himalayan city of Dharamsala.\n\nHe has angered China at a time when Beijing and Washington are struggling to improve their relationship. India's relationship with China has also been strained since 2020 when 24 soldiers were killed in a military attack along the Himalayan border.\n\nAlthough Washington considers the Tibet Autonomous Region part of China, US President Joe Biden is expected to soon sign the Tibet Settlement Act to resolve the dispute.\n\n\"This visit should underscore bipartisan support for the US Congress to have a say in shaping Tibet's own future,\" Michael McCall, head of the US delegation and one of the bill's authors, said before departing Washington on Friday.\n\nWhat are China's objections?\n\nChina accuses the Dalai Lama of being a \"separatist\" or separatist, but says he wants real autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland.\n\nWhile Beijing has always resisted meetings with foreign heads of state, that hasn't stopped the Dalai Lama from meeting with other US presidents, including US presidents, although Biden has yet to meet him.\n\nHowever, the task of appointing his successor is a highly contentious issue.\n\nWhile Beijing has said it has the right to appoint a successor to strengthen its control over Tibet, the Dalai Lama says only the Tibetan people can make that decision and that his successor can be found in India.", "source": {"uri": "thewestonforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aspetuck News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_lambert@thewestonforum.com", "name":

It is not about a religious or political cause, but about the rights of the people to preserve their culture, language, and identity. The Tibetan struggle is a struggle for human rights and dignity.\"\n\nThe copy of the Resolve Tibet Act was presented by the Congressional delegation led by Chairman Michael McCaul, Nicole Malliotakis, Gregory W Meeks, Jim McGovern, Ami Bera, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, besides Pelosi, who were seen waving American and Tibetan flags.\n\nThe bipartisan delegation flew into Dharamsala on Tuesday to meet the 88-year-old Nobel peace laureate and other top officials of the Tibetan government-in-exile.\n\nCentral Tibetan Administration (CTA) President Penpa Tsering said, \"Grateful for your instrumental leadership in sponsoring and ensuring the passage of the Resolve Tibet Act in the US Congress. We are just one step away from this becoming a law, which will significantly add value to the middle-way policy advocated by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the CTA.\"\n\nAt the felicitation ceremony, Republican representative McCaul said the Bill reaffirms America's support for the Tibetan right to self-determination.\n\n\"Just this week our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning us not to come here... But we did not let the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) intimidate us for we are here today,\" McCaul said.\n\nBeijing, which considers the Dalai Lama a 'separatist', had said that it was seriously concerned about the visit of the US lawmakers to Dharamsala.\n\nThe US delegation visit came a day ahead of a planned trip by the Dalai Lama to the US to undergo medical treatment for his knees. However, his office told VOICE that there will be no public engagement, including public audiences, of the Dalai Lama during the visit.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has been living in self-imposed exile in India

The bill awaits Biden's signature to make it into law.\n\nThe bill seeks to counter China's narrative about its control over Tibet and promote dialogue between the Chinese government and the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who is based in India since he fled the Himalayan region in 1959.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beijing urged Biden not to sign the Tibet policy bill, warning of \"resolute measures\".\n\nOn the US delegation's visit to Dharamsala and its talks with the Dalai Lama, Lin said, \"We urge the US to clearly see the sensitivity and importance of Xizang-related issues and earnestly respect China's core interests on its comments on Xizang, refrain from any forms with the Dalai group and stop sending out to the world wrong signals.\"\n\nHe also criticised the reported remarks by the Tibet government-in-exile that it is going to use the new Tibet legislation passed by the US Senate and Congress to try to force China to come to the negotiating table and urge other countries to put pressure on Beijing to hold talks with it.\n\n\"The so-called Tibet government-in-exile is an out-and-out separatist political group and an illegal organisation in total violation of China's constitution and laws. It is not recognised by any country,\" Lin said.\n\nAfter the US Congressional talks with the Dalai Lama, McCaul said on Wednesday that the Tibetans have the right to self-determination and should be allowed to practise their religion freely.\n\nAt a felicitation ceremony held after the seven US Congress members met the Tibetan leader, McCaul said the delegation had defied a warning from the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\"The Tibetan people possess a distant religion, culture and historic identity and they should have a say in their own future. You should be able to freely practise your religion and that is why we are here today in defiance of the CCP (Communist Party of China) warning,\" he said.\n\n\"Our delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here. They repeated their false claim that Tibet is part of China since the 13th century, but we did not let the CCP intimidate us and we are here today,\" he said at the event organised by the Dharamsala-based Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).\n\nHe added that the Dalai Lama, the people of Tibet and the US know that Tibet is not part of China.\n\nThe US delegation included Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera.\n\nAt his residence, the Dalai Lama told them that he wanted the people of the world to be happy and peaceful.\n\nReferring to the Tibet policy bill, McCaul said at the later event that the timing of the visit could not be better. The bill also required aggressively challenging the CCP propaganda on Tibet, he added.\n\n\"I presented the Dalai Lama with a wind chime, which will remind him of our support,\" he said.\n\n\"Like many of you, I wish that this meeting was happening in your homeland of Tibet, but 65 years ago you were forced to flee after the Chinese Communist Party annexed Tibet and slaughtered tens of thousands of Tibetan people,\" he said.\n\nThe delegation leader claimed that the CCP was determined to eliminate Tibetan culture and forcibly bring the Tibetan people under its control.\n\nThanks to the kindness of the Indian people, the Tibetans who fled their homeland are able to live freely in this country and practise their religion without fear of persecution.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day His Holiness the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul said.\n\nHe said the CCP continued to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people decades later and accused China of interfering with the process of finding a successor to the Dalai Lama.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Having suffered from health problems for years, the 88-year-old is set to fly to the United States this week for medical treatment.\n\nThe question of his successor has been a contentious and widely-debated issue.\n\nBeijing has said the tradition must continue and its officially atheist Communist leaders have the right to approve the successor, as a legacy inherited from China's emperors.\n\nTibetan tradition holds that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death, and the current leader has said his successor may be found in India.\n\nThe dispute indicates the power and influence attaching to the role and the tussle between Beijing and its rivals to control it, analysts say.\n\nThe U.S. group, which includes Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday to a warm reception from school children, Buddhist monks and nuns.\n\nPelosi said that approval by Congress for the legislation, titled the 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', or the Resolve Tibet Act, sends a message to China that Washington is clear in its thinking on the issue of Tibet.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" Pelosi said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans at Wednesday's event.\n\nBeijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, said it was seriously concerned about the visit of the lawmakers to Dharamsala and the bill.\n\nIt urged the lawmakers not to make contact with what it calls the \"Dalai clique\" and Biden not to sign the bill.\n\nChinese officials chafe at any interactions of the Dalai Lama with officials of other countries, though he has met U.S. officials, including presidents, on previous U.S. visits.\n\nBiden, however, has not met the Dalai Lama since taking office in 2021 and it is not clear if the Tibetan leader will have any engagements during this month's visit.", "source": {"uri": "thestandard.com.hk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Photograph: Leslie Shedd/US House Foreign Affairs Committee/X\n\nPelosi, who is on a two-day visit to India, said, \"No one will give credit\" to Xi for anything.\n\n\"His Holiness Dalai Lama, with his message of knowledge, tradition, compassion, purity of soul and love, will live a long time and his legacy will live forever. But you, the president of China, you'll be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything,\" said the former US House speaker.\n\nPelosi said that the Dalai Lama would not approve of her comment against the Chinese. \"When I criticise the Chinese government, he says let's pray for Nancy to rid her of her negative attitudes,\" Pelosi said during the public felicitation programme at the Tsuglagkhang complex in Dharamshala.\n\nThe bipartisan Congressional delegation arrived in India on Tuesday and was received by officials of the Central Tibetan Administration at Himachal Pradesh's Kangra airport the same day.\n\nLast week, the US Congress passed a bill urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed the bill 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', also known as the 'Resolve Tibet Act', and it now heads to President Joe Biden for a signature to become law, Radio Free Asia reported.\n\n\"You heard our colleagues talk about this legislation that was passed last week. We had been fighting this for a long time and in the spirituality of His Holiness, with manoeuvring inside the Congress, we made progress. But it's different now with the passage of this bill (Resolve Tibet Act) because this bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi further recalled the visit of the Chinese president to Washington, DC, where she told him that the US is \"objecting\" to what China is doing to the culture of Tibet.\n\nIn response, Xi said, \"You know what you're talking about, you should go there and see for yourself all the improvements that China is making in Tibet,\" Pelosi recalled.\n\n\"They are trying to erase the culture by reducing the use of the language. They are trying something that we cannot let them get away with. I'll be gracious to the Chinese people, I don't know that they're up to this, but we do know that the Chinese government is, and we do know that they must get the message. This legislation sends the message, the House and the Senate and soon to be signed by Joe Biden, the president of the United States...\" the former US House speaker added.\n\nUS Representative Congressman Gregory Meeks, who is heading the American delegation to India, too gave a strong response to Beijing's criticism of their visit, and said that the US is going to stand for what is right.\n\n\"China can express unhappiness if it wants. We are going to stand for what is right. What is right is to make sure that Tibetans have freedom. They are able to return to their native land and they are able to keep their culture & history...That's what is important...\" he said.\n\nSikyong Penpa Tsering of the Central Tibetan Administration said, \"No one can really make China happy.\"\n\n\"The meeting went on for about an hour. His Holiness (Dalai Lama) speaks about the larger interest of the society... He appreciated the US Congress people for passing the legislation,\" Penpa Tsering said about the American delegation's visit to Dharamshala.\n\nHe further said, \"Who can make China happy? They have to look at the reality and the situation and understand it from a better perspective...\"\n\nThe US legislation notably rejects Beijing's stance that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times and urges China to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nIt also urged China to begin talks with the Dalai Lama, who is the spiritual leader of Tibet, and other Tibetan leaders about how Tibet is governed. No formal talks between the two sides have taken place since 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, China said on Tuesday that Beijing is \"gravely concerned\" over the visit of the US delegation to Dharamshala.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, addressing a regular press conference on Tuesday, asked the US to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Group

Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the bipartisan delegation also visited the Central Tibetan Administration, or CTA, the Tibetan government-in-exile, which McCaul called \"the temple of democracy.\"\n\nTheir two-day trip comes a week after Congress passed legislation known as the Resolve Tibet Act urging Beijing to resolve the China-Tibet dispute through dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives - a bill they said President Joe Biden is expected to sign into law in coming days.\n\nThe bill \"is a major shift in U.S. policy towards Tibet on a road of self-determination,\" McCaul told members of the CTA. \"The United Nations talks about how every people and every country has a right to self-determination and we believe the people of Tibet have that right as well.\"\n\nNo formal talks with Beijing on how Tibet should be governed have happened since 2010.\n\nMcCaul said he was \"so proud of the people of Tibet for having this temple of democracy in exile and I hope that one day this temple of democracy will be back in Tibet itself.\"\n\nUpon receiving a framed copy of the U.S. legislation on Tibet, the Dalai Lama thanked the delegation and called the bill \"very important.\"\n\nBipartisan delegation\n\nThe congressional delegation included former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York who is his party's ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee; Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts who is also a member of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.\n\nIt also included Rep. Ami Bera, a Democrat from California, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, an Iowa Republican, and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican from New York.\n\n\"Our presence here today is also a symbol, a sign to Chinese leaders that America will never ever waver in our support for the Tibetan people,\" McGovern told the CTA.\n\nChina invaded the independent Himalayan country of Tibet in 1950 and has controlled the territory ever since. The Dalai Lama fled into exile in India amid a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.\n\nSince then, Beijing has sought to legitimize Chinese rule through the suppression of dissent and policies undermining Tibetan culture and language. More recently, China has also sought to control the reincarnation process of Tibetan religious leaders in an attempt to interfere in the selection of the Dalai Lama's reincarnation.\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party continues to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people, and they have even attempted to insert themselves into the succession of the Dalai Lama,\" McCaul said.\n\nEarlier this week, the delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party warning them not to visit Dharamsala, McCaul said.\n\n\"But we did not let the CCP intimidate us, for we are here today,\" he said.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Tuesday criticized the trip.\n\n\"We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the U.S. side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the U.S. has made to China on issues related to Xizang, have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" Lin Jian said at a media briefing, using a term that China has started to use to refer to Tibet.\n\nThe United States must not sign the bill into law and China will take steps to \"firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" he added.\n\nBeijing believes the Dalai Lama wants to split off the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Tibetan-populated areas in China's Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Gansu provinces from the rest of the country.\n\nHowever, the Dalai Lama does not advocate for independence but rather proposes what he calls a \"Middle Way\" that accepts Tibet's status as a part of China and urges greater cultural and religious freedoms, including strengthened language rights.\n\n\"We all are (the) same human being and we all have the same right. And this world belongs to humanity,\" he told the delegates at his residence.\n\n\"So we should take care of this world, irrespective of what religion or tradition (one belongs to). People of the world should be peaceful, happy,\" he said. \"That's our goal.\"\n\nGreeted warmly\n\nUpon their arrival Tuesday at Dharamsala's Gaggal Airport, the delegation was greeted by hundreds of cheering Tibetans who were waving American and Tibetan flags.\n\nLater that day and next, as the delegation visited the Central Tibetan Administration and the Tibet Museum, and participated in a public ceremony organized by the CTA.\n\n\"The Tibetan people possess a distinct religion, culture and historic identity and they should have a say in their own future. You should be able to freely practice your religion and that is why we are here today in defiance of CCP's warning,\" McCaul said at the ceremony.\n\nPelosi, the former House speaker, also underscored the importance of the Resolve Tibet Act.\n\n\"We had been fighting for this (bill) for a long time,\" she said.\n\n\"This bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThe legislation rejects Beijing's position that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times and calls on Beijing to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama.\"\n\n\"This message of the U.S. Congress should reach out to other governments,\" Sikyong Penpa Tsering, the democratically elected leader of the Central Tibetan Administration.\n\n\"I have also spoken with the State Department that once this becomes law then it's incumbent upon them to work with like-minded countries to make sure that similar resolutions or similar statements or similar laws are adopted in other nations,\" Tsering added.\n\nPelosi presented the Dalai Lama with a painting of the dome of the Capitol, which she said should serve as a constant reminder of the many friends he has there.", "source": {"uri":

The goal is to secure a negotiated agreement on Tibet and address Tibetan aspirations related to historical, cultural, religious, and linguistic identity.\n\nAmong the delegation supporting the bill are its two authors and Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the US House of Representatives. The act is titled 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act' or the Resolve Tibet Act.\n\nThe delegation also met officials of Tibet's government in exile, which functions from India.\n\nWho is Dalai Lama?\n\nLhamo Thondup, also known as Tenzin Gyatso, was born in 1935 and was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two. He was enthroned in 1940 as the 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.\n\nThe situation went haywire for the Tibetans and those who posed their faith in the 14th Dalai Lama after China invaded Tibet in 1950.\n\nThe Dalai Lama escaped to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against its rule. He has lived in exile in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala since then. In 1989, he was even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWhy has the visit become controversial?\n\nThe US lawmakers meeting Dalai Lama has infuriated China as the meeting comes at a time when Beijing and the US are struggling to improve its all-time low tie -- which is likely to descend deeper.\n\nMeanwhile, India and China are also having one of the frostiest phases in their bilateral relations ever since the 2016 Doklam and the 2020 Galwan standoffs.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is expected to sign the Resolve Tibet Act soon, aiming to address the ongoing dispute. Although Washington considers the Tibetan Autonomous Region to be part of China, the Act proposes that Tibetans have a say in their own future.\n\n\"This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" said Michael McCaul, the chief of the US delegation and one of the bill's authors, before departing from Washington on Friday.\n\nWhy China objects?\n\nChina sees Dalai Lama as a \"splittist\" or a separatist, which the Dalai Lama refuses, saying he only wants genuine autonomy for Tibet.\n\nBeijing says it will approve a successor to the current Dalai Lama -- a move which would strengthen its control over the Himalayan region. Whereas, the Dalai Lama asserts that only the Tibetan people can make that call, and his successor could be found in India.\n\n(With Reuters inputs)\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Michael McCaul of Texas, who led the delegation, added after the meeting.\n\nThe bill, passed by Congress last week, presses Beijing to resume negotiations with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders that have been frozen since 2010, and to address Tibetan people's concerns about their cultural, religious and linguistic autonomy.\n\nChina governs most of Tibet, which it claims has been part of the country since ancient times. Although the US recognizes Tibet as part of China, the Dalai Lama had met with every US president up until Donald Trump. Joe Biden has not met with the Dalai Lama.\n\nDuring the meeting, lawmakers presented the spiritual leader with a framed copy of the \"Resolve Tibet Act\" which condemns \"all oppression and coercion of Tibetans\" and affirms their right to self determination.\n\nWednesday's meeting came at a time when the US is trying to improve its relations with China following the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the move will anger China, which sees the Dalai Lama as an anti-China \"separatist\" - an accusation he denies. China also opposes any contact with the 1989 Nobel Peace laureate by foreign officials.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that affairs related to Tibet were an internal Chinese matter and that China would take \"resolute measures\" to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\n\nThe ministry also urged the US not to sign the bill into law. \"We urge the US side to adhere to its commitments of recognizing Tibet as part of China and not supporting 'Tibet independence,'\" spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular news briefing in Beijing. \"The US must not sign the bill into law.\"\n\nWashington's relations with Beijing first began to deteriorate when then-president Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nNancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022, prompting China to encircle the island with live-fire military drills after she left. Taiwan, a democracy with more than 20 million inhabitants, has been independent since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 but is claimed by the People's Republic of China.\n\nSince coming to power, Joe Biden has taken a more cautious approach to US-Chinese relations, making efforts to improve relations with Beijing.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has repeatedly asked the US not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and argues that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the United States on Thursday for medical treatment for his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [],

The bill awaits Biden's signature to make it into law.\n\nThe bill seeks to counter China's narrative about its control over Tibet and promote dialogue between the Chinese government and the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who is based in India since he fled the Himalayan region in 1959.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beijing urged Biden not to sign the Tibet policy bill, warning of \"resolute measures\".\n\nOn the US delegation's visit to Dharamsala and its talks with the Dalai Lama, Lin said, \"We urge the US to clearly see the sensitivity and importance of Xizang-related issues and earnestly respect China's core interests on its comments on Xizang, refrain from any forms with the Dalai group and stop sending out to the world wrong signals.\"\n\nHe also criticised the reported remarks by the Tibet government-in-exile that it is going to use the new Tibet legislation passed by the US Senate and Congress to try to force China to come to the negotiating table and urge other countries to put pressure on Beijing to hold talks with it.\n\n\"The so-called Tibet government-in-exile is an out-and-out separatist political group and an illegal organisation in total violation of China's constitution and laws. It is not recognised by any country,\" Lin said.\n\nAfter the US Congressional talks with the Dalai Lama, McCaul said on Wednesday that the Tibetans have the right to self-determination and should be allowed to practise their religion freely.\n\nAt a felicitation ceremony held after the seven US Congress members met the Tibetan leader, McCaul said the delegation had defied a warning from the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\"The Tibetan people possess a distant religion, culture and historic identity and they should have a say in their own future. You should be able to freely practise your religion and that is why we are here today in defiance of the CCP (Communist Party of China) warning,\" he said.\n\n\"Our delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here. They repeated their false claim that Tibet is part of China since the 13th century but we did not let the CCP intimidate us and we are here today,\" he said at the event organised by the Dharamsala-based Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).\n\nHe added that the Dalai Lama, the people of Tibet and the US know that Tibet is not part of China.\n\nThe US delegation included Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera.\n\nAt his residence, the Dalai Lama told them that he wanted the people of the world to be happy and peaceful.\n\nReferring to the Tibet policy bill, McCaul said at the later event that the timing of the visit could not be better. The bill also required aggressively challenging the CCP propaganda on Tibet, he added.\n\n\"I presented the Dalai Lama with a wind chime, which will remind him of our support,\" he said.\n\n\"Like many of you, I wish that this meeting was happening in your homeland of Tibet, but 65 years ago you were forced to flee after the Chinese Communist Party annexed Tibet and slaughtered tens of thousands of Tibetan people,\" he said.\n\nThe delegation leader claimed that the CCP was determined to eliminate Tibetan culture and forcibly bring the Tibetan people under its control.\n\nThanks to the kindness of the Indian people, the Tibetans who fled their homeland are able to live freely in this country and practise their religion without fear of persecution.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day His Holiness the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul said.\n\nHe said the CCP continued to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people decades later, and accused China of interfering with the process of finding a successor to the Dalai Lama.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The visit underscores U.S. bipartisan support for Tibetan rights and aims to push Beijing into talks over Tibet's autonomy. China sees the Dalai Lama as a separatist and objects to foreign engagements with him.\n\nA delegation of U.S. lawmakers met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday in India's northern town of Dharamsala.\n\nThe meeting annoyed Beijing, which urged the United States on Tuesday to \"fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique\" and refrain from \"any form of contact with it\". WHY IS THE DELEGATION IN INDIA?\n\nThe bipartisan seven-member group of American lawmakers is visiting India to meet the Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama. The United States has long supported the rights of the Tibetan people to practice their religion and culture, and has accused China of human rights violations in the remote Himalayan region that borders India.\n\nA bipartisan bill passed this month by the U.S. House of Representatives aims seeks to push Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to secure a negotiated agreement on Tibet and spur China to tackle Tibetan aspirations on historical, cultural, religious and linguistic identity. Among the delegation are the two authors of the act, titled 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act' or the Resolve Tibet Act, along with Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe delegation also met officials of Tibet's government in exile, which functions from India. WHO IS THE DALAI LAMA?\n\nBorn in 1935 as Lhamo Thondup, the Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two, and enthroned in 1940 as the 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. Beijing invaded Tibet in 1950, and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against its rule, since when he has lived in exile in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. WHY IS THE VISIT CONTROVERSIAL?\n\nIt has riled China at a time when Beijing and Washington are struggling to improve ties, and India's relations with China have also been strained since a military standoff on their Himalayan frontier killed 24 soldiers in 2020. U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the Resolve Tibet Act soon, in a bid to find a resolution for the dispute, although Washington considers the Tibetan Autonomous Region to be a part of China.\n\n\"This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" the chief of the U.S. delegation, and one author of the bill, Michael McCaul, said ahead of his departure from Washington on Friday. WHAT ARE CHINA'S OBJECTIONS?\n\nChina accuses the Dalai Lama of being a \"splittist\" or a separatist, but he says he wants genuine autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland. While Beijing has always objected to his meetings with foreign leaders, this has not prevented the Dalai Lama from meeting them, including U.S. presidents, although Biden has not met him yet.\n\nHowever, the most contentious issue is the task of appointing his successor. While Beijing has said it has the right to approve a successor, in a move set to strengthen its control over Tibet, the Dalai Lama says only the Tibetan people can make that call, and his successor could be found in India.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The 88-year-old, who has battled health problems for years, is set to fly to the United States this week for medical treatment.\n\nThe question of the Dalai Lama's successor has been a thorny issue, which analysts say highlights the power and influence of the role, fuelling Beijing's tussle to control it.\n\nTibetan tradition holds that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death, and the current leader has said his successor may be found in India.\n\nBeijing has said the tradition must continue but its officially atheist Communist leaders have the right to approve the successor, as a legacy inherited from China's emperors.\n\nTibetans hail breakthrough\n\nThe US group, which includes Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday for a two-day visit.\n\nPelosi said Congress approval of the legislation, titled the 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', or the Resolve Tibet Act, sent a message to China that Washington was clear in its thinking on the issue of Tibet.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" she said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans at Wednesday's event.\n\nPhotographs on the Dalai Lama's website showed him holding a framed copy of the bill as the lawmakers stood alongside.\n\nBeijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, has said it was seriously concerned about the bill and the lawmakers' visit, urging them not to contact what it calls the \"Dalai clique\" and Biden not to sign the bill.\n\nThe Indian foreign ministry offered no immediate comment on the lawmakers' visit.\n\nTies between the Asian rivals have been strained over their long mountainous border since army clashes in 2020 killed 20 Indian and four Chinese troops.\n\nAt the same time, concerns about China's growing might, among others, have nudged New Delhi and Washington closer in the last two decades.\n\nWhile Chinese officials chafe at any interactions of the Dalai Lama with officials of other countries, Biden has not met the Tibetan leader since taking office in 2021 and it is not clear if his treatment plans will allow time for engagements.\n\n\"Presidential assent for the bill would be far more concerning for China than whether Biden or any other leader meets the Dalai Lama,\" said Tibet specialist Robert Barnett of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).\n\nCongressional approval of the bill was a \"significant breakthrough,\" said Penpa Tsering, the political leader of the exiled Tibetan government, who believed it would put pressure on Beijing to negotiate.\n\nBut the Dalai Lama had always sought \"autonomy or a middle way, not independence\" for Tibet, he added. -- Reuters",

The remarks come as Washington and Beijing seek to steady rocky ties while India pushes China to secure lasting peace on their disputed Himalayan frontier, four years after a military clash strained ties.\n\nThe lawmakers also signalled that Washington would pressure Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to resolve the Tibet issue, with a bill they said President Joe Biden would sign soon. Although Washington recognises Tibet as a part of China, the bill appears to question that position and any change would be a major shock to Beijing, analysts said.\n\nThe bipartisan group of seven, led by Michael McCaul, a Republican representative from Texas, who also chairs the House foreign affairs committee, met the Nobel peace laureate at his monastery in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala. \"It is still my hope that one day the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul told a public reception after the meeting.\n\nBeijing has even attempted to insert itself into choosing the successor of the Dalai Lama, he said, but added, \"We will not let that happen.\" The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet. The 88-year-old, who has battled health problems for years, is set to fly to the United States this week for medical treatment.\n\nThe question of the Dalai Lama's successor has been a thorny issue, which analysts say highlights the power and influence of the role, fuelling Beijing's tussle to control it. Tibetan tradition holds that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death, and the current leader has said his successor may be found in India.\n\nBeijing has said the tradition must continue but its officially atheist Communist leaders have the right to approve the successor, as a legacy inherited from China's emperors. TIBETANS HAIL BREAKTHROUGH\n\nThe U.S. group, which includes Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday for a two-day visit. Pelosi said Congress approval of the legislation, titled the 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', or the Resolve Tibet Act, sent a message to China that Washington was clear in its thinking on the issue of Tibet.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" she said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans at Wednesday's event. Photographs on the Dalai Lama's website showed him holding a framed copy of the bill as the lawmakers stood alongside.\n\nBeijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, has said it was seriously concerned about the bill and the lawmakers' visit, urging them not to contact what it calls the \"Dalai clique\" and Biden not to sign the bill. The Indian foreign ministry offered no immediate comment on the lawmakers' visit.\n\nTies between the Asian rivals have been strained over their long mountainous border since army clashes in 2020 killed 20 Indian and four Chinese troops. At the same time, concerns about China's growing might, among others, have nudged New Delhi and Washington closer in the last two decades.\n\nWhile Chinese officials chafe at any interactions of the Dalai Lama with officials of other countries, Biden has not met the Tibetan leader since taking office in 2021 and it is not clear if his treatment plans will allow time for engagements. \"Presidential assent for the bill would be far more concerning for China than whether Biden or any other leader meets the Dalai Lama,\" said Tibet specialist Robert Barnett of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).\n\nCongressional approval of the bill was a \"significant breakthrough\", said Penpa Tsering, the political leader of the exiled Tibetan government, who believed it would put pressure on Beijing to negotiate. But the Dalai Lama had always sought \"autonomy or a middle way, not independence\" for Tibet, he added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

PTI\n\nIn a heavily worded message to China from across the border, former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday said that \"change is on the way\" after she met the Dalai Lama in Himachal Pradesh's Dharamshala.\n\n\"His Holiness Dalai Lama, with his message of knowledge, tradition, compassion, purity of soul and love, will live a long time and his legacy will live forever. But you, the President of China, you'll be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything,\" Pelosi said following her meeting with the exiled spiritual leader as part of a high-level US delegation visit to the town.\n\nShe added, \"Dalai Lama would not approve of my saying that when I criticize the Chinese government, he says, let's pray for Nancy to rid her of her negative attitudes. I hope he will indulge me today to say that change is on the way.\"\n\nThe visit comes as the US and China have increased talks in recent months, in a bid to normalize strained ties. But news of the visit and the subject of the bill triggered swift backlash from China.\n\nAfter their arrival on Tuesday, the delegation met officials from the Tibetan government-in-exile, which wants more autonomy for Tibet.\n\nResolve Tibet Act\n\nThe meeting between the Dalai Lama and Republican Rep. Michael McCaul-led delegation reportedly focused on the Resolve Tibet Act, recently passed by the US Congress, aimed at encouraging dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese officials that could result in a peaceful resolution to the dispute between Tibet and Beijing. The bill will now go to the White House for President Joe Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe former US House Speaker said, \"You heard our colleagues talk about this legislation passed last week. We had been fighting this for a long time and in the spirituality of His Holiness, with manoeuvring inside the Congress, we made progress. But it's different now with the passage of this bill (Resolve Tibet Act) because this bill is a message to the Chinese Government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet.\"\n\nPelosi also said that during one of her visits to Tibet, she found that the Chinese government is trying to erase the culture of the region by reducing the use of the language.\n\n\"We saw the room where His Holiness grew up&mldr; They are trying to erase the culture by reducing the use of the language. They are trying something that we cannot let them get away with,\" she said.\n\nVisit irks China\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing, who has repeatedly warned Washington not to interfere with Tibetan affairs, on Tuesday warned of \"resolute measures\" if the US signs the Resolve Tibet Act into law.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian said.\n\nHe added, \"We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They also signaled Washington's pressure on Beijing to resume talks with Tibetan leaders. Beijing's attempts to decide the successor have been contentious, with the Dalai Lama fleeing to India in 1959.\n\nA group of U.S. lawmakers who met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in India on Wednesday said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor, comments expected to anger Beijing which calls him a separatist. They also signalled that Washington would pressure Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to resolve the Tibet issue with a bill President Joe Biden is expected to sign soon.\n\nThe bipartisan group of seven, led by Michael McCaul, a Republican representative from Texas, who also chairs the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, met the Nobel peace laureate at his monastery in the northern town of Dharamsala. \"It is still my hope that one day the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul told a public reception after the meeting.\n\nBeijing has even attempted to insert itself into choosing the successor of the Dalai Lama, he said, but added, \"We will not let that happen.\" The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet. Having suffered from health problems for years, the 88-year-old is set to fly to the United States this week for medical treatment.\n\nThe question of his successor has been a contentious and widely-debated issue. Beijing has said the tradition must continue and its officially atheist Communist leaders have the right to approve the successor, as a legacy inherited from China's emperors.\n\nTibetan tradition holds that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death, and the current leader has said his successor may be found in India. The dispute indicates the power and influence attaching to the role and the tussle between Beijing and its rivals to control it, analysts say.\n\nThe U.S. group, which includes Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday to a warm reception from school children, Buddhist monks and nuns. Pelosi said that approval by Congress for the legislation, titled the 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', or the Resolve Tibet Act, sends a message to China that Washington is clear in its thinking on the issue of Tibet.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" Pelosi said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans at Wednesday's event. Beijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, said it was seriously concerned about the visit of the lawmakers to Dharamsala and the bill.\n\nIt urged the lawmakers not to make contact with what it calls the \"Dalai clique\" and Biden not to sign the bill. Chinese officials chafe at any interactions of the Dalai Lama with officials of other countries, though he has met U.S. officials, including presidents, on previous U.S. visits.\n\nBiden, however, has not met the Dalai Lama since taking office in 2021 and it is not clear if the Tibetan leader will have any engagements during this month's visit.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse

The bill awaits Biden's signature to make it into law.\n\nThe bill seeks to counter China's narrative about its control over Tibet and promote dialogue between the Chinese government and the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who is based in India since he fled the Himalayan region in 1959.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beijing urged Biden not to sign the Tibet policy bill, warning of \"resolute measures\".\n\nOn the US delegation's visit to Dharamsala and its talks with the Dalai Lama, Lin said, \"We urge the US to clearly see the sensitivity and importance of Xizang-related issues and earnestly respect China's core interests on its comments on Xizang, refrain from any forms with the Dalai group and stop sending out to the world wrong signals.\" He also criticised the reported remarks by the Tibet government-in-exile that it is going to use the new Tibet legislation passed by the US Senate and Congress to try to force China to come to the negotiating table and urge other countries to put pressure on Beijing to hold talks with it.\n\n\"The so-called Tibet government-in-exile is an out-and-out separatist political group and an illegal organisation in total violation of China's constitution and laws. It is not recognised by any country,\" Lin said.\n\nAfter the US Congressional talks with the Dalai Lama, McCaul said on Wednesday that the Tibetans have the right to self-determination and should be allowed to practise their religion freely.\n\nAt a felicitation ceremony held after the seven US Congress members met the Tibetan leader, McCaul said the delegation had defied a warning from the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\"The Tibetan people possess a distant religion, culture and historic identity and they should have a say in their own future. You should be able to freely practise your religion and that is why we are here today in defiance of the CCP (Communist Party of China) warning,\" he said.\n\n\"Our delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here. They repeated their false claim that Tibet is part of China since the 13th century but we did not let the CCP intimidate us and we are here today,\" he said at the event organised by the Dharamsala-based Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).\n\nHe added that the Dalai Lama, the people of Tibet and the US know that Tibet is not part of China.\n\nThe US delegation included Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera.\n\nAt his residence, the Dalai Lama told them that he wanted the people of the world to be happy and peaceful.\n\nReferring to the Tibet policy bill, McCaul said at the later event that the timing of the visit could not be better. The bill also required aggressively challenging the CCP propaganda on Tibet, he added.\n\n\"I presented the Dalai Lama with a wind chime, which will remind him of our support,\" he said.\n\n\"Like many of you, I wish that this meeting was happening in your homeland of Tibet, but 65 years ago you were forced to flee after the Chinese Communist Party annexed Tibet and slaughtered tens of thousands of Tibetan people,\" he said.\n\nThe delegation leader claimed that the CCP was determined to eliminate Tibetan culture and forcibly bring the Tibetan people under its control.\n\nThanks to the kindness of the Indian people, the Tibetans who fled their homeland are able to live freely in this country and practise their religion without fear of persecution.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day His Holiness the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul said.\n\nHe said the CCP continued to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people decades later, and accused China of interfering with the process of finding a successor to the Dalai Lama.

The White House \"must not sign the bill into law\" or China will take \"resolute measures\", said Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Mr Lin added, urging the US side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe charges by Beijing have been denied by the Dalai Lama who said he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThis visit is the latest flashpoint in the US and Congress relationship, which reached a communication point recently after several years of turmoil and contentious escalations.\n\nBeijing does not recognise the exiled administration and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010.", "source": {"uri":

We had been fighting this for a long time and in the spirituality of His Holiness, with manoeuvring inside the Congress, we made progress. But it's different now with the passage of this bill (Resolve Tibet Act) because this bill is a message to the Chinese Government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi further recalled the visit of the Chinese President to Washington, DC where she told him that the US is \"objecting\" to what China is doing to the culture of Tibet.\n\nIn response, Xi said, \"You know what you're talking about, you should go there and see for yourself all the improvements that China is making in Tibet,\" Pelosi recalled.\n\n\"They are trying to erase the culture by reducing the use of the language. They are trying something that we cannot let them get away with. I'll be gracious to the Chinese people, I don't know that they're up to this, but we do know that the Chinese government is, and we do know that they must get the message. This legislation sends the message, the House and the Senate and soon to be signed by Joe Biden, the president of the United States...\" the former US House Speaker added.\n\nUS Representative Congressman Gregory Meeks who is heading the American delegation's visit to India too gave a strong response to Beijing's criticism of their visit, and said that the US is going to stand for what is right.\n\n\"China can express unhappiness if it wants. We are going to stand for what is right. What is right is to make sure that Tibetans have freedom. They are able to return to their native land and they are able to keep their culture & history...That's what is important...\" he said.\n\nSikyong Penpa Tsering of the Central Tibetan Administration said \"no one can really make China happy.\"\n\n\"The meeting went on for about an hour. His Holiness (Dalai Lama) speaks about the larger interest of the society...He appreciated the US Congress people for passing the legislation,\" Penpa Tsering said on the meeting of the American delegation to Dharamshala.\n\nHe further said, \"Who can make China happy? They have to look at the reality and the situation and understand it from a better perspective...\"\n\nThe US legislation, notably rejects Beijing's stance that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times and urges China to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nIt also urged China to begin talks with the Dalai Lama, who is the spiritual leader of Tibet, and other Tibetan leaders about how Tibet is governed. No formal talks between the two sides have taken place since 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, China said on Tuesday that Beijing is \"gravely concerned\" over the visit of the US delegation to Dharamshala.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian addressing a regular press conference yesterday asked the US to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Group and

The passage of this bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet. This legislation would soon be signed by President Joe Biden,\" said Pelosi, adding that Jim McGovern, the author of the bill and part of the visiting US delegation, is \"the patron saint of our Tibet policy.\"\n\nShe said that the Chinese government was trying to erase Tibetan culture. \"They (China) are trying to erase Ti-betan culture by reducing the use of the Tibetan language. The ethnic Han population is being assimilated with the Tibetan population in Tibet. We have seen in Tibet that the Chinese government is trying to educate Tibetan children in the Chinese way to reduce the knowledge of Tibetan language. They (China) are trying something that we cannot let them get away with,\" said Pelosi.\n\nSending a stern message to President Xi Jinping of China, Pelosi said: \"His Holiness, the Dalai Lama with his compassion, purity of soul and love, will live for a long time and his legacy will liveforever. But, you, the President of China, you'll be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything,\" said Pelosi. House foreign affairs committee chairman Michael McCaul, who led the US delegation, said that the US would not allow China to interfere with the succession of the Dalai Lama. \"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continues to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people and has even attempted to insert themselves into the succession of the Dalai Lama. But we won't let that happen,\" said McCaul.\n\nHe said that the Chinese government had threatened the delegation not to visit the Dalai Lama. \"The delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here. They sent a letter in whichthey repeated their false claim that Tibet has been a part of China since the 13th century. But we did not let the CCP intimidate us, for we are here today,\" said McCaul, adding that people of Tibet, the Dalai Lama and the United States know that Tibet is not part of China.\n\n\"The Tibetan people possess a distinctive religious culture and identity. You should have a say in your own future. This is why we are here today in defiance of that warning,\" he said. \"The timing of this visit couldn't be better. We are here just a week after the House of Representatives and the Congress passed the Resolve Tibet Act,\" said McCaul, adding that the bill will be signed by President Biden in the coming days.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rohit_mullick@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Rohit Mullick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Tibetan_Administration", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Tibetan Administration"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhasa_Tibetan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lhasa Tibetan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod_Ganj", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLeod Ganj"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McLeod Ganj"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McCaul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael McCaul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McGovern_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim McGovern (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural assimilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Han Chinese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Buddhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Buddhism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan Medicine", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111127454,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-62114,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

The 88-year-old, who has battled health problems for years, is set to fly to the United States this week for medical treatment.\n\nThe question of the Dalai Lama\u2019s successor has been a thorny issue, which analysts say highlights the power and influence of the role, fuelling Beijing\u2019s tussle to control it.\n\nTibetan tradition holds that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death, and the current leader has said his successor may be found in India.\n\nBeijing has said the tradition must continue, but its officially atheist Communist leaders have the right to approve the successor, as a legacy inherited from China\u2019s emperors.\n\nThe US group, which includes Democratic former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday for a two-day visit.\n\nPelosi said Congress approval of the legislation, titled \u201cPromoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act\u201d, or the Resolve Tibet Act, sent a message to China that Washington was clear in its thinking on the issue of Tibet.\n\n\u201cThis bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\u201d she said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans at Wednesday\u2019s event.\n\nPhotographs on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website showed him holding a framed copy of the bill as the lawmakers stood alongside.\n\nBeijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \u201csplittist\u201d or separatist, has said it was seriously concerned about the bill and the lawmakers\u2019 visit, urging them not to contact what it calls the \u201cDalai clique\u201d and Biden not to sign the bill.\n\nThe Indian foreign ministry offered no immediate comment on the lawmakers\u2019 visit.\n\nTies between the Asian rivals have been strained over their long mountainous border since army clashes in 2020 killed 20 Indian and four Chinese troops.\n\nAt the same time, concerns about China\u2019s growing might, among others, have nudged New Delhi and Washington closer in the last two decades.\n\nWhile Chinese officials chafe at any interactions of the Dalai Lama with officials of other countries, Biden has not met the Tibetan leader since taking office in 2021 and it is not clear if his treatment plans will allow time for engagements.\n\n\u201cPresidential assent for the bill would be far more concerning for China than whether Biden or any other leader meets the Dalai Lama,\u201d said Tibet specialist Robert Barnett of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).\n\nCongressional approval of the bill was a \u201csignificant breakthrough\u201d, Penpa Tsering, the political leader of the exiled Tibetan government, said in an interview.\n\nHe said he believed it would put pressure on Beijing to negotiate and that it could serve as a precedent for other nations to adopt similar policies to Washington.\n\n\u201cThis will give us a tool to work with other governments,\u201d he said in his office in Dharamsala.\n\nBut the Dalai Lama had always sought \u201cautonomy or a middle way, not independence\u201d for Tibet, he added.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This visit, involving a bipartisan delegation of seven lawmakers, is poised to escalate tensions between the US and China.\n\nThe delegation, led by Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, arrived in Dharamshala on Tuesday. The visit coincides with President Joe Biden's anticipated signing of a new bill aimed at urging Beijing to address longstanding issues in Tibet.\n\nThis bill demands the protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture and calls for renewed negotiations with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders, which have been stalled since 2010.\n\nPelosi was forthright in her message: \"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that.\" Her words were echoed by McCaul, who expressed hope that the Dalai Lama and his people would one day return to Tibet in peace.\n\nLawmakers presented the Dalai Lama with a framed copy of the \"Resolve Tibet Act,\" which condemns oppression of Tibetans and asserts their right to self-determination. This gesture underscores the US Congress's support for Tibetan autonomy.\n\nChina, which maintains that Tibet has been an integral part of its territory since ancient times, is predictably incensed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry swiftly condemned the meeting, reiterating that Tibet is an internal matter and warning of \"resolute measures\" to protect its sovereignty.\n\nThe ministry also urged the US not to sign the bill into law, emphasizing the need for Washington to honor its commitment to recognizing Tibet as part of China and not supporting Tibetan independence.\n\nThe backdrop to this meeting includes a broader context of fluctuating US-China relations. Diplomatic ties have been strained since the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and Pelosi's controversial visit to Taiwan in 2022 further exacerbated tensions. During that visit, China responded with aggressive military drills around Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nDespite these frictions, President Biden has sought a more cautious and conciliatory approach towards China, aiming to mend relations post-pandemic. However, Beijing's repeated calls for non-interference in Tibetan affairs continue to clash with US legislative actions supporting Tibetan rights and autonomy.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is scheduled to travel to the United States on Thursday for medical treatment. It remains uncertain whether he will meet with any US officials during his visit. Such a meeting would undoubtedly add another layer of complexity to the already strained US-China relations.\n\nSources:\n\nUS lawmakers meet Tibet's Dalai Lama, say won't let China influence choice

The bill awaits Biden's signature to make it into law.\n\nThe bill seeks to counter China's narrative about its control over Tibet and promote dialogue between the Chinese government and the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who is based in India since he fled the Himalayan region in 1959.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beijing urged Biden not to sign the Tibet policy bill, warning of \"resolute measures\".\n\nOn the US delegation's visit to Dharamsala and its talks with the Dalai Lama, Lin said, \"We urge the US to clearly see the sensitivity and importance of Xizang-related issues and earnestly respect China's core interests on its comments on Xizang, refrain from any forms with the Dalai group and stop sending out to the world wrong signals.\" He also criticised the reported remarks by the Tibet government-in-exile that it is going to use the new Tibet legislation passed by the US Senate and Congress to try to force China to come to the negotiating table and urge other countries to put pressure on Beijing to hold talks with it.\n\n\"The so-called Tibet government-in-exile is an out-and-out separatist political group and an illegal organisation in total violation of China's constitution and laws. It is not recognised by any country,\" Lin said.\n\nAfter the US Congressional talks with the Dalai Lama, McCaul said on Wednesday that the Tibetans have the right to self-determination and should be allowed to practise their religion freely.\n\nAt a felicitation ceremony held after the seven US Congress members met the Tibetan leader, McCaul said the delegation had defied a warning from the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\"The Tibetan people possess a distant religion, culture and historic identity and they should have a say in their own future. You should be able to freely practise your religion and that is why we are here today in defiance of the CCP (Communist Party of China) warning,\" he said.\n\n\"Our delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here. They repeated their false claim that Tibet is part of China since the 13th century but we did not let the CCP intimidate us and we are here today,\" he said at the event organised by the Dharamsala-based Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).\n\nHe added that the Dalai Lama, the people of Tibet and the US know that Tibet is not part of China.\n\nThe US delegation included Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera.\n\nAt his residence, the Dalai Lama told them that he wanted the people of the world to be happy and peaceful.\n\nReferring to the Tibet policy bill, McCaul said at the later event that the timing of the visit could not be better. The bill also required aggressively challenging the CCP propaganda on Tibet, he added.\n\n\"I presented the Dalai Lama with a wind chime, which will remind him of our support,\" he said.\n\n\"Like many of you, I wish that this meeting was happening in your homeland of Tibet, but 65 years ago you were forced to flee after the Chinese Communist Party annexed Tibet and slaughtered tens of thousands of Tibetan people,\" he said.\n\nThe delegation leader claimed that the CCP was determined to eliminate Tibetan culture and forcibly bring the Tibetan people under its control.\n\nThanks to the kindness of the Indian people, the Tibetans who fled their homeland are able to live freely in this country and practise their religion without fear of persecution.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day His Holiness the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul said.\n\nHe said the CCP continued to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people decades later, and accused China of interfering with the process of finding a successor to the Dalai Lama.

REUTERS/Stringer\n\nBy Krishn Kaushik\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - A delegation of U.S. lawmakers met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday in India's northern town of Dharamsala.\n\nThe meeting annoyed Beijing, which urged the United States on Tuesday to \"fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique\" and refrain from \"any form of contact with it\".\n\nWHY IS THE DELEGATION IN INDIA?\n\nThe bipartisan seven-member group of American lawmakers is visiting India to meet the Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe United States has long supported the rights of the Tibetan people to practice their religion and culture, and has accused China of human rights violations in the remote Himalayan region that borders India.\n\nA bipartisan bill passed this month by the U.S. House of Representatives aims seeks to push Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to secure a negotiated agreement on Tibet and spur China to tackle Tibetan aspirations on historical, cultural, religious and linguistic identity.\n\nAmong the delegation are the two authors of the act, titled 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act' or the Resolve Tibet Act, along with Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe delegation also met officials of Tibet's government in exile, which functions from India.\n\nWHO IS THE DALAI LAMA?\n\nBorn in 1935 as Lhamo Thondup, the Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two, and enthroned in 1940 as the 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.\n\nBeijing invaded Tibet in 1950, and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against its rule, since when he has lived in exile in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nWHY IS THE VISIT CONTROVERSIAL?\n\nIt has riled China at a time when Beijing and Washington are struggling to improve ties, and India's relations with China have also been strained since a military standoff on their Himalayan frontier killed 24 soldiers in 2020.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the Resolve Tibet Act soon, in a bid to find a resolution for the dispute, although Washington considers the Tibetan Autonomous Region to be a part of China.\n\n\"This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" the chief of the U.S. delegation, and one author of the bill, Michael McCaul, said ahead of his departure from Washington on Friday.\n\nWHAT ARE CHINA'S OBJECTIONS?\n\nChina accuses the Dalai Lama of being a \"splittist\" or a separatist, but he says he wants genuine autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland.\n\nWhile Beijing has always objected to his meetings with foreign leaders, this has not prevented the Dalai Lama from meeting them, including U.S. presidents, although Biden has not met him yet.\n\nHowever, the most contentious issue is the task of appointing his successor.\n\nWhile Beijing has said it has the right to approve a successor, in a move set to strengthen its control over Tibet, the Dalai Lama says only the Tibetan people can make that call, and his successor could be found in India.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)\n\nCLICK

lawmakers to India upset China?", "body": "The bipartisan seven-member group of American lawmakers is visiting India to meet the Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama.A delegation of U.S. lawmakers met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday in India's northern town of Dharamsala.\n\nThe meeting annoyed Beijing, which urged the United States on Tuesday to \"fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique\" and refrain from \"any form of contact with it\".\n\nWHY IS THE DELEGATION IN INDIA?\n\nThe bipartisan seven-member group of American lawmakers is visiting India to meet the Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe United States has long supported the rights of the Tibetan people to practice their religion and culture, and has accused China of human rights violations in the remote Himalayan region that borders India.\n\nA bipartisan bill passed this month by the U.S. House of Representatives aims seeks to push Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to secure a negotiated agreement on Tibet and spur China to tackle Tibetan aspirations on historical, cultural, religious and linguistic identity.\n\nAmong the delegation are the two authors of the act, titled 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act' or the Resolve Tibet Act, along with Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe delegation also met officials of Tibet's government in exile, which functions from India.\n\nWHO IS THE DALAI LAMA?\n\nBorn in 1935 as Lhamo Thondup, the Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two, and enthroned in 1940 as the 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.\n\nBeijing invaded Tibet in 1950, and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against its rule, since when he has lived in exile in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nWHY IS THE VISIT CONTROVERSIAL?\n\nIt has riled China at a time when Beijing and Washington are struggling to improve ties, and India's relations with China have also been strained since a military standoff on their Himalayan frontier killed 24 soldiers in 2020.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the Resolve Tibet Act soon, in a bid to find a resolution for the dispute, although Washington considers the Tibetan Autonomous Region to be a part of China.\n\n\"This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" the chief of the U.S. delegation, and one author of the bill, Michael McCaul, said ahead of his departure from Washington on Friday.\n\nWHAT ARE CHINA'S OBJECTIONS?\n\nChina accuses the Dalai Lama of being a \"splittist\" or a separatist, but he says he wants genuine autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland.\n\nWhile Beijing has always objected to his meetings with foreign leaders, this has not prevented the Dalai Lama from meeting them, including U.S. presidents, although Biden has not met him yet.\n\nHowever, the most contentious issue is the task of appointing his successor.\n\nWhile Beijing has said it has the right to approve a successor, in a move set to strengthen its control over Tibet, the Dalai Lama says only the Tibetan people can make that call, and his successor could be found in India.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(PTI)\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday that exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism the Dalai Lama must \"thoroughly correct\" his political views as a condition for contact with China's central government to resume.\n\nFormal talks between China and the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, and his representatives have been stalled since 2010.\n\n\"With regard to contact and negotiations between the central government of China and the 14th Dalai Lama, our policy has been consistent and clear,\" said Lin Jian, a spokesman at China's foreign ministry.\n\n\"The key is that the 14th Dalai Lama must fundamentally reflect on and thoroughly correct his political views,\" Lin said at a regular ministry news conference.\n\nThe Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognise and views as a violation of China's constitution.\n\nYet China continues to chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries, including former US presidents, even though the Dalai Lama says he is not seeking independence for Tibet.\n\nThe 88-year-old, whom China sees as a dangerous separatist in a monk's robes, remains the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.\n\nUS lawmakers are currently asking President Joe Biden to sign a bill aimed at pressing China to secure a negotiated and peaceful agreement on Tibet.\n\nA group of US lawmakers, who met the Dalai Lama in India on Wednesday, said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor.\n\nWhile Washington recognises Tibet as a part of China, the bill appears to question that position, analysts say.\n\nBeijing has rejected the Resolve Tibet Act, saying Tibet is part of China and brooks no interference from external forces.\n\n\"We urge the United States to fully recognise the importance and sensitivity of Tibet-related issues and earnestly respect China's core interests,\" Lin said.\n\n\"We should abide by our commitment on the issue of obstacles, refrain from any form of contact with the Dalai clique, and stop sending wrong messages to the outside world.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person",

Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, arrived Tuesday in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala, where the Dalai Lama has lived since the 1960s. The delegation visited the offices of the Tibetan government in exile, which is pushing for autonomy for Tibet within China.A high-level U.S. congressional delegation, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., met with the Dalai Lama at his Indian home Wednesday, a visit that was condemned in advance by China's government, which considers the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader a separatist.\n\nThe delegation, led by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, arrived Tuesday in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala, where the Dalai Lama has lived since the 1960s. The delegation visited the offices of the Tibetan government in exile, which is pushing for autonomy for Tibet within China.\n\nThe trip comes days after Congress passed a bill with bipartisan support that urged China to start dialogue with Tibetan leaders to find a solution to the long-standing conflict.\n\nChina's criticism of the visit was immediate and unsurprising. Its leaders consider the government in exile illegal and regard any support for the cause of autonomy for Tibet, which they call Xizang, as interference in internal Chinese matters.\n\n\"We urge the U.S. side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the U.S. has made to China on issues related to Xizang, stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said in a statement Tuesday night.\n\nU.S. officials have often met with the Dalai Lama, 88. Pelosi's presence in the delegation, however, brought reminders of her 2022 trip to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its territory, when she was still speaker of the House.\n\nThat contentious visit, which raised fears within the Biden administration of further deteriorating a frosty relationship with Beijing, led to a sharp response from China, including trade restrictions on Taiwan and military exercises near the island.\n\nThe visit to India also comes as Washington and New Delhi deepen their relationship, motivated in part by the perception of a shared Chinese threat. Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden's national security adviser, is in New Delhi this week, holding multiple rounds of talks with Indian officials on expanding defense and technology cooperation.\n\nThose extensive discussions, coming weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a third term in office, indicate how much Washington prioritizes the relationship with India, with U.S. officials increasingly speaking of New Delhi as a counterweight to Beijing.\n\nTenzin Lekshay, a spokesperson for the Central Tibetan Administration, the government in exile, said Tibet's situation should not be seen through \"the lens of increasing rivalry between the U.S. and China,\" but as a reminder of how the Tibetan way of life \"is facing an existential threat\" as China assimilates the region.\n\n\"We do hope that leaders of the free world will stand for the Tibet cause, particularly stressing the Chinese leadership to reinstall the dialogue to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict,\" Lekshay said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The group of influential US lawmakers, including said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor, comments that may rile up Beijing which calls him a separatist.\n\nThe delegation, which is on a two-day visit to India, comprises former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congress members Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera. The US lawmakers met the Nobel peace laureate at his monastery in the northern town of Dharamsala.\n\nThey indicated that Washington would exert pressure on Beijing to initiate talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to find a solution to the Tibet issue with a bill US President Joe Biden is expected to sign soon.\n\nSpeaking at a public reception after the meeting, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Dalai Lama will live a long time with his \"message of knowledge, and tradition\" while Chinese President Xi Jinping will be gone and won't be remembered for anything.\n\n\"I had told to the President of China during his visit to the Washington DC that you are trying to oppress the Tibet. He said that we should go to the Tibet and see all the improvement that China is making in Tibet. We went, the delegation, to the Potala Palace. They are trying something that we can not let them get away with. This legislation sends the message, the House and the Senate, and the President of the USA Joe Biden is soon going to sign this. People are important for this Bill to be passed,\" she said.\n\n\"Dalai Lama will live long and his legacy will live on forever. But you, the President of China, you will be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything. I know Dalai Lama would not approve when I criticise China. But change is on the way. Faith of Tibetan people in goodness of others is what is going to make all the difference. God bless Tibet and God bless America,\" she added.\n\nThe US has strongly been supporting the Tibetan cause and condemning all oppression and coercion of Tibetans by China. China recently warned of \"resolute measures\" if the Tibet policy bill is signed into law by the US President.\n\nEarlier this month, the US Congress passed a legislation, the Resolve Tibet Act, calling for a peaceful resolution of the dispute over the status and governance of Tibet. It also calls on Beijing to resume dialogue with the Tibetan spiritual leader.\n\nChina objected to the Act and asked Biden not to sign it. \"Anyone or any force who attempts to destabilise Xizang to contain or suppress China will not succeed,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday. \"The US should not sign the bill. China will take resolute measures to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" he said. China officially refers to Tibet as Xizang.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has been demanding an autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland. In its talks with China between 2002 and 2010, the Tibetan side pitched autonomy for all Tibetan areas including Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces besides the current official Tibet Autonomous Region.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siddhi_gaharwar@news9live.com", "name": "Siddhi Gaharwar", "type": "author",

debated issue.\n\nBeijing has said the tradition must continue and its officially atheist Communist leaders have the right to approve the successor, as a legacy inherited from China's emperors.\n\nTibetan tradition holds that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death, and the current leader has said his successor may be found in India.\n\nThe dispute indicates the power and influence attached to the role and the tussle between Beijing and its rivals to control it, analysts say.\n\nThe US group, which includes Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday to a warm reception from school children, Buddhist monks and nuns.\n\nPelosi said that approval by Congress for the legislation, titled the \"Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act\", or the Resolve Tibet Act, sends a message to China that Washington is clear in its thinking on the issue of Tibet.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" Pelosi said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans at Wednesday's event.\n\nBeijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, said it was seriously concerned about the visit of the lawmakers to Dharamsala and the bill.\n\nIt urged the lawmakers not to make contact with what it calls the \"Dalai clique\" and Biden not to sign the bill.\n\nChinese officials chafe at any interactions of the Dalai Lama with officials of other countries, though he has met US officials, including presidents, on previous US visits.\n\nBiden, however, has not met the Dalai Lama since taking office in 2021 and it is not clear if the Tibetan leader will have any engagements during this month's visit.", "source": {"uri": "chronicle.lu", "dataType": "news", "title":

Other members of the delegation include Congress members Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera.\n\nThe visit comes as US President Joe Biden is set to reportedly sign a legislation that aims to press China to resolve the Tibet dispute. Beijing has been critical of both moves, saying Tibet is an internal matter of China that brooks no interference by external forces, Reuters reported.\n\nTalking about the visit, Dolma Gyari, the security minister of the Central Tibetan Administration, the Tibetan government-in-exile, told ANI that the message was clear to China \"that freedom-loving nations in the world, people who promote peace and justice, support Tibet\". She also added that the US support for Tibetan people is a strong message. She stated that it can be seen as \"support for India also\".\n\nMcCaul expressed enthusiasm about the visit and was quoted by PTI as saying, \"We are excited to meet His Holiness the Dalai Lama and to talk about many things, including the bill passed by Congress which basically says that the United States of America stands with the people of Tibet.\"\n\nMcCaul said President Joe Biden would soon sign the 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', also known as the 'Resolve Tibet Act', cleared by the US Congress last week.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, the bill aims to push Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to secure a negotiated agreement on Tibet. It also urges China to address the Tibetan people's aspirations regarding their historical, cultural, religious and linguistic identity, the report said.\n\n\"US lawmakers have regularly visited Dharamsala and touted the work of the Dalai Lama to draw global support for linguistic and cultural autonomy in his remote, mountainous homeland,\" the report added. A figure of deep respect among Tibetans, the Dalai Lama is described by China as a separatist. The Central Tibetan Administration and the Dalai Lama say they don't seek independence for Tibet but bat for \"genuine autonomy for all Tibetans living in the three traditional provinces of Tibet within the framework of the People's Republic of China\".\n\nSpeaking to ANI, Tenzin Lekshay, spokesperson of the Tibetan government-in-exile, said the US delegation's visit is a \"jubilant\" moment for them. He said the US delegation and His Holiness Dalai Lama held a high-level meeting.\n\n\"The Resolve Tibet Act, which has already been significantly adopted, is now at the desk of President Biden. So, they are confident that President Biden will soon sign the bill and it will become a law. This is a very important thing for us,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHe said China is always unhappy when Tibetans do something, adding that China should introspect \"to see that whatever was done over the course of 70 years is not for Tibetans but for China's good\".\n\nLekshay added that they were grateful to the Indian government and the public \"for all they did for the Tibetans\", saying the Tibetan issue concerns India as well. \"So, I think Indian people should also be aware of the Tibetan issue,\" he said.\n\nThe US delegation's visit has come at a time when the US and China have sought to stabilise their rocky relations, the Reuters report noted.

The delegation's visit has sparked significant backlash from Beijing, coming at a time when the US and China are attempting to stabilise their rocky relationship.\n\nThe US delegation's visit aims to discuss the recently passed 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act,' commonly known as the Resolve Tibet Act. The bill urges Beijing to engage in dialogue with Tibetan leaders, a process that has been stalled since 2010, to negotiate an agreement on Tibet's future. The bill is now awaiting US President Joe Biden's signature.\n\n\"We are very excited to see His Holiness tomorrow to talk about many things, including the bill we just passed out of Congress that basically says the United States of America stands with the people of Tibet,\" McCaul had said. He confirmed that Biden would soon sign the bill into law.\n\nUpon their arrival at Kangra airport, the delegation was greeted by crowds of Tibetans, including school children holding banners and dozens of monks and nuns in maroon robes, who cheered as the lawmakers made their way to meet the Dalai Lama.\n\nBeijing's reaction to the US visit\n\nChina has expressed serious concern about the visit of the US lawmakers to Dharamsala and the potential signing of the Resolve Tibet Act by Biden. Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, stated, \"We urge the US to fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique, abide by its commitments on Tibet-related issues, refrain from any form of contact with it, and stop sending erroneous messages.\"\n\nHe stated that Tibet's affairs are purely internal matters for China and warned that Beijing would take \"resolute and forceful measures\" to safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet, is viewed by Beijing as a dangerous separatist. Chinese officials have long been irked by his interactions with foreign officials, and the recent visit by the US delegation has further fueled their ire.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added, urging the US side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nDespite Beijing's protests, the Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and insists that he only advocates for substantial autonomy and the protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture under Chinese rule.\n\nHistorical context of China-Tibet relations\n\nThe conflict over Tibet's status within China is deeply rooted in historical claims and political developments. China's motivations for annexing Tibet in 1950 were both ideological and pragmatic.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) aimed to shore up China's southwestern border and access Tibet's plentiful natural resources. Ideologically, the CCP viewed Tibet as a feudal-theocracy that needed \"liberation\" and believed that Tibet had always been a part of China, making its incorporation a historical necessity.\n\nHowever, Tibet's history is complex and distinct. Prior to the 1950 invasion, Tibet had existed independently of Chinese control, with its own unique culture, language, and religion. Even after the Qing dynasty established suzerainty over Tibet in 1720, Tibetans remained largely free of direct Chinese interference. Following the end of Qing rule in 1911, Tibet functioned as a de facto independent state until the Chinese invasion.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) crossed the Jinsha (Yangtze) River and entered Tibet on 7 October, 1950. By 19 October, they had captured Chamdo, neutralising the Tibetan garrison there. Over 3,000 Tibetans were made prisoners, and at least 180 died in the fighting. The defeat led to the signing of the Seventeen Point Agreement in May 1951, which effectively subordinated Tibet to China while promising to maintain Tibetan autonomy, culture, and religion.\n\nDespite these assurances, Chinese interference in Tibetan affairs grew, leading to widespread unrest. By 1959, frustration with Chinese policies led to a revolt in Lhasa.\n\nAlso Read: Tibetan culture, livelihoods are being damned in Xi Jinping's China\n\nFearing arrest by the Chinese, the Dalai Lama fled to India on 23 March, 1959, repudiating the Seventeen Point Agreement and proclaiming himself Tibet's legitimate representative. Since then, China's control over Tibet has been absolute, with severe crackdowns on dissent and efforts to assimilate Tibetans into Chinese culture.\n\nThe role of the Dalai Lama\n\nThe Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is revered by Tibetans worldwide as their spiritual leader. Since his exile in India, he has lobbied for Tibetan self-rule and substantial autonomy under Chinese sovereignty. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his efforts to resolve the Tibet issue peacefully.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has a history of engaging with US officials. He has met with every American president from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama, except for Donald Trump, and is yet to meet Joe Biden. These meetings have often led to stern condemnation from China, which views them as undermining its sovereignty and supporting Tibetan independence.\n\nThe recent visit by US lawmakers to Dharamsala is seen by China as part of a broader strategy by Washington to counter Beijing's influence. This perception is compounded by the strengthening of US-India relations, with both countries viewing each other as counterweights to China's rising power.\n\nChina's tightening grip on Tibet\n\nSince the 1959 uprising, China has tightened its grip on Tibet, implementing policies aimed at assimilating Tibetans and eradicating dissent. Beijing has facilitated the influx of Han Chinese into Tibet, changing its demographic and cultural landscape. The Chinese government has also installed its own people in key religious positions, further eroding Tibetan autonomy.\n\nIn recent years, China has also sought to control the process of selecting the Dalai Lama's successor. Beijing insists that it has the right to approve the next Dalai Lama, a claim rooted in its historical role of endorsing Tibetan Buddhist leaders.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, however, has stated that his successor may be found outside Tibet, possibly in India, a move that Beijing strongly opposes.\n\nWhat the future may hold\n\nThe ongoing tension between China and Tibet remains a significant issue in international politics. The US and other countries continue to express support for Tibetan autonomy and cultural preservation. The Resolve Tibet Act, if signed into law by Biden, will further solidify US support for the Tibetan cause and pressure China to engage in dialogue.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's health remains a concern as he approaches his 89th birthday. He is expected to travel to the US for medical treatment, but it is unclear if he will meet with any officials during his visit. The question of his successor looms large, with the potential to further escalate tensions between China and the Tibetan exile community.\n\nAlso Read: With China willing to discuss 'Dalai Lama's future', Tibetan fate hangs in balance\n\nThe historical context of China-Tibet relations, coupled with recent developments, has only underlined the complexity and sensitivity of this issue. The US, along with India continues to be focused on finding a peaceful resolution that respects the rights and aspirations of the Tibetan people.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType":

She said that although the Tibetan spiritual leader's legacy would live on forever, the Chinese president would disappear in a few years.\n\nNews agency ANI quoted Pelosi, who is on a two-day visit to India, as saying: \"His Holiness the Dalai Lama, with his message of knowledge, tradition, compassion, purity of soul and love , will live long and his legacy will live forever. But you, the president of China, will be gone and no one will give you credit for anything.\n\nAdding that the Dalai Lama would not approve of his comments against Xi Jinping, Pelosi said: \"When I criticize the Chinese government, he (the Dalai Lama) says: let's pray that Nancy rids her of her negative attitudes.\" \"\n\nPelosi made the remarks during the public felicitation program at Tsuglagkhang Complex in Dharamshala.\n\nArriving in India on Tuesday, the bipartisan Congressional delegation was received by officials of the Central Tibetan Administration at the Kangra airport in Himachal Pradesh.\n\nLast week, the US Congress passed a bill aimed at challenging China's assertion of historic control over Tibet and encouraging Beijing to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully address their differences regarding the status and governance of Tibet.\n\nAfter the US House of Representatives passed the \"Promoting a Resolution of the Tibet-China Dispute Act\", also known as the \"Tibet Resolution Act\", the bill is now waiting signed by US President Joe Biden to become law.\n\nRegarding the bill, ANI quoted Pelosi as saying: \"You heard our colleagues talk about this legislation that passed last week. We have been fighting this for a long time and in the spirituality of His Holiness, through maneuvering within Congress, we have made progress.\"\n\n\"But it's different now with the passage of this bill (Resolve Tibet Act) because this bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi added.\n\n\"They (the Chinese government) are trying to erase the culture (of Tibet) by reducing the use of language. They are trying something that we cannot allow them to get away with. I will be kind to the Chinese people , I do not do it\". I don't know they're planning this, but we know the Chinese government is, and we know they have to get the message,\" the former speaker of the US House of Representatives said, adding: \"This legislation sends the message to the House and Senate and will soon be signed by Joe Biden, the President of the United States...\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Michael McCaul, Republican Chairman of the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs and a member of the bipartisan US delegation, confirmed President Biden's intention to sign the Resolve Tibet Act.\n\nGregory Meeks, the US representative leading the delegation's visit to India, responded strongly to Beijing's criticism of their visit, saying the US would respect what is fair and just.\n\n\"China can express its displeasure if it wants. We will stand up for what is right,\" Meeks said, adding: \"What is right is to ensure that Tibetans enjoy freedom. They can return to their native country and they are able to keep their culture and their history... That's what's important....\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Beijing expressed serious concerns about the visit and urged the United States to \"fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai Lama group.\"\n\nHe also warned the United States against signing the bill, saying \"China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\"\n\nMcCaul said the delegation, including Pelosi, also received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party warning them against coming to Dharamshala.\n\n\"They repeated their false claim that Tibet has been part of China since the 13th century, but we did not allow ourselves to be intimidated by the CCP because we are here today.

China, which considers the Dalai Lama a separatist, has vehemently opposed the meeting.\n\nThe seven-member US delegation is visiting India in the wake of the recently passed \"Resolve Tibet Act\" by the US House of Representatives, which seeks to pressure Beijing into resuming dialogue with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, and address Tibetan aspirations for historical, cultural, religious, and linguistic identity.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, born Lhamo Thondup in 1935, was recognised as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two and was enthroned in 1940. Following a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959, he fled to India, where he has lived in exile in Dharamsala. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nThe issue of the Dalai Lama's successor remains contentious. Beijing insists on its right to approve the next Dalai Lama, a move seen as an attempt to tighten its control over Tibet. However, the Dalai Lama maintains that the choice lies solely with the Tibetan people and has suggested that his successor could be found in India.\n\nPrior to the US lawmakers' meeting with the Dalai Lama, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson urged the US to \"fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique\" and to refrain from \"any form of contact with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reincarnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Buddhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Buddhism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan Medicine", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Voluntary_Simplicity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Voluntary Simplicity", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Reincarnation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Reincarnation", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/nancy-pelosi--dalai-lama-193754549-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=w0pIQYpN.0nERjSDv8.IURYJDkrEPUtF", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Talks with the Dalai Lama's representatives and China stalled in 2010.\n\n\"This bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" Nancy Pelosi, former House Speaker, said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans whom the lawmakers addressed at a public ceremony after meeting the Dalai Lama at his residence.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is expected to soon sign the legislation called \"Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act,\" also referred to as the Resolve Tibet Act.\n\nIn Dharamshala, where the Tibetan government in exile is based, the visit of the U.S. lawmakers brought hope. \"It is a jubilant moment for all Tibetans. We are all overjoyed. The visit is very significant because it comes soon after the passage of the bill which we hope will soon be passed into law,\" Tenzin Lekshay, spokesperson for the Central Tibetan Administration, told VOA.\n\nCongressman Michael McCaul, who led the seven-member visiting delegation, said the bill reaffirms American support for what he referred to as the Tibetan right to self- determination. He said that their delegation had received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party, warning them not to visit.\n\nBeijing said the U.S. should not sign into law the bill passed by Congress. \"China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lin Jian said on Tuesday, as the lawmakers arrived in the Indian town.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in New Delhi reiterated Beijing's concerns. \"We urge the U.S. side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the U.S. has made to China on issues related to Xizang, stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" it said in a statement Tuesday night. Xizang is China's name for Tibet.\n\nIn his remarks to Tibetans, McCaul said it is important that China not influence the choice of the Dalai Lama's successor. \"Beijing has even attempted to insert itself into choosing the successor of the Dalai Lama,\" he said. \"We will not let that happen.\"\n\nThe issue is contentious. China says it has the right to approve the spiritual leader's successor while according to Tibetan tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death. The Dalai Lama has said his successor is likely to be found in India but Tibetans in exile fear China will try to designate a person to be the successor, in an effort to bolster control over Tibet.\n\nMeanwhile, Tibetan spokesman Lekshay said China needs to come forward to reinstate a dialogue with exiled Tibetan leaders. \"It is a time for introspection for China to see what is going wrong, particularly with the Tibet issue which has been a longstanding conflict. China needs to be more positive.\"\n\nBeijing does not recognize the exiled administration. A formal dialogue process between the Dalai Lama's representatives and the Chinese government ended in 2010 after it failed to produce a concrete outcome.\n\nPointing out that they are asking for autonomy within China and not independence, Lekshay said the Tibetan administration in exile did not represent a separatist movement.\n\nTibetans in exile say they fear that their culture, language and identity is under threat due to Chinese assimilation of the region.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959, has been instrumental in putting the Tibetan cause in the global spotlight but in recent years some Tibetan activists have expressed concerns that the Tibet cause is not getting appropriate attention in Western capitals.\n\nThe Himalayan town of Dharamshala has been the Dalai Lama's home since he fled Tibet over six decades ago following a failed uprising against Chinese rule.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"},

We saw the room where His Holiness grew up.\"\n\n\"They are trying to erase the culture by reducing the use of the language. They are trying something that we cannot let them get away with. I'll be gracious to the Chinese people, I don't know that they're up to this, but we do know that the Chinese government is, and we do know that they must get the message. This legislation sends the message, the House and the Senate and soon to be signed by Joe Biden, the president of the United States.\", she further added.\n\nDolma Tsering Teykhang, deputy speaker of the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile, said that the visit of the US lawmakers demonstrates that \"Tibet is not alone.\" She highlighted that the delegation's presence sends a message of support for human rights and freedom, not only for Tibet but for anyone aspiring to these values. Teykhang also noted that China is \"annoyed\" with anyone who supports Tibet, but the representatives and senators are there to support a just cause.\n\nEarlier this week, the US Congress passed the 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', also known as the 'Resolve Tibet Act', which urges China to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet. The legislation rejects Beijing's stance that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times and calls for an end to the propagation of disinformation about Tibetan history, people, and institutions.\n\nUpon arrival in Dharamshala, Pelosi expressed her excitement about being there, while McCaul affirmed President Biden's intention to sign the 'Resolve Tibet Act'. The US Representative highlighted the significance of the bill passed by Congress and expressed enthusiasm about the upcoming meeting with the Dalai Lama.\n\nChina, however, expressed grave concern over the US delegation's visit to Dharamshala. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian urged the US to recognize the \"anti-China separatist nature\" of the Dalai Group and to refrain from sending the wrong signal to the world. China maintains that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

"A group of US lawmakers who met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in India say they will not allow China to influence the choice of his successor, comments expected to anger Beijing, which calls him a separatist.\n\nThey also signalled that Washington would pressure Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to resolve the Tibet issue with a bill President Joe Biden is expected to sign soon.\n\nThe bipartisan group of seven, led by Michael McCaul, a Republican representative from Texas, who also chairs the House committee on foreign affairs, met the Nobel peace laureate at his monastery in the northern town of Dharamsala.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul told a public reception on Wednesday.\n\nBeijing had even attempted to insert itself into choosing the successor of the Dalai Lama, he said, but added, \"We will not let that happen.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet.\n\nAfter years of health problems, the 88-year-old will fly to the United States this week for medical treatment.\n\nThe question of his successor has been a contentious issue.\n\nBeijing has said the tradition must continue and its officially atheist Communist leaders have the right to approve the successor, as a legacy inherited from China's emperors.\n\nTibetan tradition holds that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death, and the current leader has said his successor might be found in India.\n\nThe US group, which includes Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday to a warm reception from schoolchildren, Buddhist monks and nuns.\n\nPelosi said approval by Congress for the legislation sent a message to China that Washington was clear about Tibet.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" Pelosi said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans at Wednesday's event.\n\nBeijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, said it was seriously concerned about the lawmakers' visit and the bill.\n\nIt urged them not to make contact with the \"Dalai clique\" and Biden not to sign the bill.\n\nChinese officials chafe at any interactions of the Dalai Lama with officials of other countries, though he has met US officials, including presidents, on previous US visits.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet",

Beijing considers the government-in-exile illegal and regards any support for the cause of Tibetan autonomy to be interference in its internal matters.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian on Tuesday said Beijing has \"strong concerns\" over the trip and has asked the US to \"see clearly the anti-China separatism nature\" of the Dalai Lama and his followers. The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi also issued a message, asking the US to \"fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group\" and \"honor the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang.\"\n\nDespite China's protest, the delegation visited the Dalai Lama's residence in McLeod Ganj, Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Michael McCaul, chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, who was part of the delegation, told media outlets that US President Joe Biden would soon sign a bill that aims to pressure China to resolve the Tibet dispute, according to The Hindustan Times.\n\nA day earlier, McCaul told media that the delegation would discuss \"many things,\" including the bill passed by the US Congress earlier this month calling on Beijing to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama. The bipartisan legislation called 'The Resolve Tibet Act' aims to \"enhance US support\" for Tibet and \"promote dialogue\" between China and the Dalai Lama toward a \"peaceful resolution of the long-standing dispute.\"\n\nDuring the meeting on Wednesday, Pelosi lashed out at Chinese leader Xi Jinping, saying \"You, the president of China (Xi Jinping), you'll be gone and no one will give you credit for anything.\" She contrasted Xi's legacy with the Dalai Lama's, asserting that the latter's will \"live forever.\"\n\nPelosi had also visited India in 2017 to meet the Dalai Lama, prompting a similar protest from Beijing.\n\nThe US delegation featuring Pelosi is reminiscent of another controversy she triggered in Asia, in 2022, when she visited Taiwan as the speaker of the US House of Representatives - despite warnings from both Beijing and the Biden administration against such a move. China responded by announcing military exercises and warned that the visit had \"a severe impact on the political foundation of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Washington has vowed to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and has supplied Taipei with defensive weaponry.

He appreciated their \"strong and continued\" support for the strategic partnership between India and the US.\n\nThe US Congressional delegation includes former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, US Representatives - Gregory Meeks, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Ami Bera and Jim McGovern.\n\nIn a post on X, Jaishankar stated, \"Pleasure to meet with the bipartisan US Congressional delegation led by @RepMcCaul. Thank @SpeakerPelosi, @RepGregoryMeeks, @RepMMM, @NMalliotakis, @RepBera and @RepMcGovern for joining. Appreciate their strong and continued support for the strategic partnership.\"\n\nThe US Congressional delegation, which arrived in India on Tuesday, was received by officials of the Central Tibetan Administration at Himachal Pradesh's Kangra Airport. Upon arrival, the US lawmakers headed to Dharamshala to meet Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama.\n\nOn Wednesday, the high-level US Congressional delegation, led by US Congressman Michael McCaul, met Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamshala.\n\nBefore meeting the Dalai Lama, the US delegates attended a public felicitation programme at the main Tibetan temple. The disciples of the Dalai Lama were also seen in the temple complex this morning. Children performed and displayed Tibetan culture at the felicitation ceremony in the courtyard of the Tsuglagkhang Complex in Dharamshala.\n\nDuring their meeting at his residence in Dharamshala today, McCaul presented Dalai Lama with a framed copy of The Resolve Tibet Act, a bipartisan bill passed by the US Congress to enhance US support for Tibet.\n\nLast week, the US Congress passed a bill urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet.\n\nThe legislation rejects Beijing's stance that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times and urges China to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama,\" Radio Free Asia reported.\n\nThe Dalai Lama presented Buddha Statue to Pelosi at the end of the meeting with the US Congressional delegation, the office of the Dalai Lama said.\n\nThe members of the US Congressional delegation also posed for a group photo with the Tibetan spiritual leader after their meeting.

for contact with China's central government to resume.\n\nFormal talks between China and the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, and his representatives have been stalled since 2010.\n\n\"With regard to contact and negotiations between the central government of China and the 14th Dalai Lama, our policy has been consistent and clear,\" said Lin Jian, a spokesman at China's foreign ministry.\n\n\"The key is that the 14th Dalai Lama must fundamentally reflect on and thoroughly correct his political views,\" Lin said at a regular ministry news conference.\n\nThe Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognise and views as a violation of China's constitution.\n\nYet China continues to chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries, including former US presidents, even though the Dalai Lama says he is not seeking independence for Tibet.\n\nThe 88-year-old, whom China sees as a dangerous separatist in a monk's robes, remains the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.\n\nRead also: US lawmakers to meet Dalai Lama in India next week\n\nUS lawmakers are currently asking President Joe Biden to sign a bill aimed at pressing China to secure a negotiated and peaceful agreement on Tibet.\n\nA group of US lawmakers, who met the Dalai Lama in India on Wednesday, said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor.\n\nWhile Washington recognises Tibet as a part of China, the bill appears to question that position, analysts say.\n\nBeijing has rejected the Resolve Tibet Act, saying Tibet is part of China and brooks no interference from external forces.\n\n\"We urge the United States to fully recognise the importance and sensitivity of Tibet-related issues and earnestly respect China's core interests,\" Lin said.\n\n\"We should abide by our commitment on the issue of obstacles, refrain from any form of contact with the Dalai clique, and stop sending wrong messages to the outside world.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Beijing considers the government-in-exile illegal and regards any support for the cause of Tibetan autonomy to be interference in its internal matters.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian on Tuesday said Beijing has \"strong concerns\" over the trip and has asked the US to \"see clearly the anti-China separatism nature\" of the Dalai Lama and his followers. The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi also issued a message, asking the US to \"fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group\" and \"honor the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang.\"\n\nDespite China's protest, the delegation visited the Dalai Lama's residence in McLeod Ganj, Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Michael McCaul, chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, who was part of the delegation, told media outlets that US President Joe Biden would soon sign a bill that aims to pressure China to resolve the Tibet dispute, according to The Hindustan Times.\n\nA day earlier, McCaul told media that the delegation would discuss \"many things,\" including the bill passed by the US Congress earlier this month calling on Beijing to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama. The bipartisan legislation called 'The Resolve Tibet Act' aims to \"enhance US support\" for Tibet and \"promote dialogue\" between China and the Dalai Lama toward a \"peaceful resolution of the long-standing dispute.\"\n\nDuring the meeting on Wednesday, Pelosi lashed out at Chinese leader Xi Jinping, saying \"You, the president of China (Xi Jinping), you'll be gone and no one will give you credit for anything.\" She contrasted Xi's legacy with the Dalai Lama's, asserting that the latter's will \"live forever.\"\n\nPelosi had also visited India in 2017 to meet the Dalai Lama, prompting a similar protest from Beijing.\n\nThe US delegation featuring Pelosi is reminiscent of another controversy she triggered in Asia, in 2022, when she visited Taiwan as the speaker of the US House of Representatives - despite warnings from both Beijing and the Biden administration against such a move. China responded by announcing military exercises and warned that the visit had \"a severe impact on the political foundation of China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Washington has vowed to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and has supplied Taipei with defensive weaponry. Earlier this week, the US approved the $360 million sale of more than 1,000 small armed drones to Taiwan.", "source": {"uri": "cambodiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cambodian Times"},

political views as a condition for contact with China's central government to resume.\n\nFormal talks between China and the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, and his representatives have been stalled since 2010.\n\n\"With regard to contact and negotiations between the central government of China and the 14th Dalai Lama, our policy has been consistent and clear,\" said Lin Jian, a spokesman at China's foreign ministry.\n\n\"The key is that the 14th Dalai Lama must fundamentally reflect on and thoroughly correct his political views,\" Lin said at a regular ministry news conference.\n\nThe Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognise and views as a violation of China's constitution.\n\nYet China continues to chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries, including former U.S. presidents, even though the Dalai Lama says he is not seeking independence for Tibet.\n\nThe 88-year-old, whom China sees as a dangerous separatist in a monk's robes, remains the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are currently asking President Joe Biden to sign a bill aimed at pressing China to secure a negotiated and peaceful agreement on Tibet.\n\nA group of U.S. lawmakers, who met the Dalai Lama in India on Wednesday, said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor.\n\nWhile Washington recognises Tibet as a part of China, the bill appears to question that position, analysts say.\n\nBeijing has rejected the Resolve Tibet Act, saying Tibet is part of China and brooks no interference from external forces.\n\n\"We urge the United States to fully recognise the importance and sensitivity of Tibet- elated issues and earnestly respect China's core interests,\" Lin said.\n\n\"We should abide by our commitment on the issue of obstacles, refrain from any form of contact with the Dalai clique, and stop sending wrong messages to the outside world.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestandard.com.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

are very excited to see his holiness tomorrow to talk about many things, including the bill that just passed out of Congress that basically says that the USA stands with the people of Tibet.\"\n\nThe group's visit coincides with US President Joe Biden's expected signing of legislation known as the \"Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act,\" which was passed by the US Congress this month and aims to promote dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama toward a \"peaceful resolution of the long-standing dispute between Tibet and China.\"\n\nForeign leaders meeting with the Dalai

Having suffered from health problems for years, the 88-year-old is set to fly to the United States this week for medical treatment.\n\nThe question of his successor has been a contentious and widely-debated issue.\n\nBeijing has said the tradition must continue and its officially atheist Communist leaders have the right to approve the successor, as a legacy inherited from China's emperors.\n\nTibetan tradition holds that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death, and the current leader has said his successor may be found in India.\n\nThe dispute indicates the power and influence attaching to the role and the tussle between Beijing and its rivals to control it, analysts say.\n\nThe U.S. group, which includes Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived on Tuesday to a warm reception from school children, Buddhist monks and nuns.\n\nPelosi said that approval by Congress for the legislation, titled the 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', or the Resolve Tibet Act, sends a message to China that Washington is clear in its thinking on the issue of Tibet.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" Pelosi said to cheers from hundreds of Tibetans at Wednesday's event.\n\nBeijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, said it was seriously concerned about the visit of the lawmakers to Dharamsala and the bill.\n\nIt urged the lawmakers not to make contact with what it calls the \"Dalai clique\" and Biden not to sign the bill.\n\nChinese officials chafe at any interactions of the Dalai Lama with officials of other countries, though he has met U.S. officials, including presidents, on previous U.S. visits.\n\nBiden, however, has not met the Dalai Lama since taking office in 2021 and it is not clear if the Tibetan leader will have any engagements during this month's visit.

The visit comes at a time when the US-China ties are already at an all time low, with many claiming that the United States' main agenda is to contain Beijing.\n\nTalks between Beijing and the Tibetan leaders have been stalled since 2010. Tibetan leaders, under the leadership of the the Dalai Lama, wished to secure an agreement after a failed uprising in the Chinese oppressions in Tibet, which led to their mass exodus in 1959.\n\nUS Delegation in Dharamashala\n\nA bipartisan delegation of seven lawmakers, including Republican Representative Michael McCaul and Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are in the Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh. They met the Dalai Lama on Wednesday, June 19. The delegation visited the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile in Dharamshala on Tuesday.\n\nThe seven-member visiting US delegation includes Rep Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep Nancy Pelosi, Speaker Emerita, Rep Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Rep Gregory Meeks, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep Nicole Malliotakis, Rep Jim McGovern, and Rep Ami Bera.\n\nWhat is Tibet Policy Bill?\n\nThe US Congress, with the support of both Republicans and Democrats, passed the Resolve Tibet Act earlier this week. The act calls for a peaceful resolution of the dispute over the status and governance of Tibet. It also calls on Beijing to resume dialogue with the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. The US House of Representatives passed 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', also known as the 'Resolve Tibet Act'. It will become an act after the signature of Joe Biden.\n\nThe Resolve Tibet Act is a bipartisan bill to enhance US support for Tibet and promote dialogue between the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama toward a peaceful resolution of the long-standing dispute between Tibet and China.\n\nWhat China Said on US' Move?\n\nChina has openly opposed the bill, asking US President Joe Biden to not sign it. China officially refers to Tibet as Xizang. \"Anyone or any force who attempts to destabilise Xizang to contain or suppress China will not succeed,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nBeijing has even warned of resolute measures, calling it a 'sovereignty issue'. \"The US should not sign the bill. China will take resolute measures to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the spokesperson said.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Dalai Lama has stated that he does not advocate for political independence for Tibet but has not endorsed Beijing's historical claims.\n\nThe Dalai Lama after a special event in Dharamshala on June 11 during which exile Tibetans made him traditional offerings and prayed for his long life.

Formal dialogue between the two sides has not occurred since 2010.\n\nThe US State Department considers the autonomous region and other Tibetan areas as part of China, and no sitting US president has met with the Dalai Lama since Barack Obama did in 2016, though there have been regular visits by US officials and former presidents.\n\nIndia, which has hosted the spiritual leader and his followers for decades, recognised Tibet as part of China in 2003. But since a deadly border clash in 2020 killed at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers in the contentious Kashmir region, New Delhi has abandoned its deference to Chinese sensibilities over the issue.\n\nThe US delegation's trek to Dharamshala coincides with a trip by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell to New Delhi, where Sullivan met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi while Campbell spoke with other officials.\n\nAccording to Harsh Pant, an international relations professor at King's College London, the delegation's meeting with the Dalai Lama will add another layer of complexity and tension to fraying US-China relations.\n\n\"It signals that there is bottom-up pressure on the Biden administration - that is trying to stabilise relationship with China - to relook at the question of Tibet,\" Pant said.\n\nPant said that the relationship would remain \"tumultuous going forward\" because the wider political establishment in the US remains focused on elevating issues like Tibet and Taiwan \"which perhaps in the past would have been considered not so important in the larger scheme of things\".\n\n\"I think China is going to be more focused on this sudden interest and sudden attempt by the US in reopening this question\" of Tibet, Pant added.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

No country in the world recognizes it,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lin Jian said, according to state-run broadcaster CGTN.\n\nHis remarks came a day after a high-level bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers met with Dalai Lama in India's northern Himalayan state on Wednesday, despite Beijing urging Washington to avoid contact with the head of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nRegarding contacts between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama, Lin said that Beijing's policy is \"consistent and clear, and that the key point is the 14th Dalai Lama must fundamentally rethink and thoroughly correct his political stance.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, China had urged the US to \"fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group.\"\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a 'pure religious figure', but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in India wrote on X.\n\n\"We urge the US side...

Despite stepping down as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile in 2011, the Dalai Lama remains a significant spiritual leader, causing tension between China and other countries.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday that exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism the Dalai Lama must \"thoroughly correct\" his political views as a condition for contact with China's central government to resume.\n\nFormal talks between China and the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, and his representatives have been stalled since 2010. \"With regard to contact and negotiations between the central government of China and the 14th Dalai Lama, our policy has been consistent and clear,\" said Lin Jian, a spokesman at China's foreign ministry.\n\n\"The key is that the 14th Dalai Lama must fundamentally reflect on and thoroughly correct his political views,\" Lin said at a regular ministry news conference. The Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognise and views as a violation of China's constitution.\n\nYet China continues to chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries, including former U.S. presidents, even though the Dalai Lama says he is not seeking independence for Tibet. The 88-year-old, whom China sees as a dangerous separatist in a monk's robes, remains the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are currently asking President Joe Biden to sign a bill aimed at pressing China to secure a negotiated and peaceful agreement on Tibet. A group of U.S. lawmakers, who met the Dalai Lama in India on Wednesday, said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor.\n\nWhile Washington recognises Tibet as a part of China, the bill appears to question that position, analysts say. Beijing has rejected the Resolve Tibet Act, saying Tibet is part of China and brooks no interference from external forces.\n\n\"We urge the United States to fully recognise the importance and sensitivity of Tibet-related issues and earnestly respect China's core interests,\" Lin said. \"We should abide by our commitment on the issue of obstacles, refrain from any form of contact with the Dalai clique, and stop sending wrong messages to the outside world.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "14th Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Tibetan_Administration", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Tibetan Administration"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State Council of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical_Intermediates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical Intermediates", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan Medicine", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/20_06_2024_14_18_09_5051707.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The meeting was held a day after the delegation arrived to a warm reception by school children, Buddhist monks and nuns in this hill town.\n\nThe team, led by Michael McCaul, a Republican representative from Texas, who also chairs the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, includes Democrat former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThere was a felicitation function held in the courtyard of the Buddhist temple outside Dalai lama's palace later.\n\nThe delegation visited the Tibetan Parliament on Tuesday and a dinner was hosted in their honour by the Tibetan Government in Exile here.\n\nIssues the lawmakers were set to discuss with the Dalai Lama include a U.S. bill that aims to press China to resolve the Tibet dispute and awaits President Joe Biden's signature, McCaul said on Tuesday.\n\nBeijing, which allegedly calls the Dalai Lama a \"dangerous separatist\", said it was seriously concerned about the visit and the bill.\n\nChina urged the lawmakers not to make contact with what it calls the \"Dalai clique\" and requested Biden not to sign the bill.\n\nThe Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet.

A few hours later, she unleashed a fierce criticism of China and slammed Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"His Holiness the Dalai Lama will live a long time and his legacy will live forever, but you, the President, will be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything. The Dalai Lama would not approve my saying this that I am criticising the Chinese government. He would say, 'Let's pray for Nancy to rid her of negative attitudes.' But I hope he will indulge me today in saying change is on the way. As our colleagues have said, hope brings some faith and the faith of the Tibetan people, in the goodness of others, is going to make all the difference,\" Pelosi said at a gathering of cheering Tibetans.\n\nAdditionally, she stated that the Resolve Tibet Act's bipartisan support conveys to China Washington's clear position on the matter.\n\n\"This bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, get ready for that,\" she said.\n\nWith President Joe Biden's signature, the act will force China to reopen conversations with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders that have been on hold for the past 14 years.\n\nUnlike all US presidents since George HW Bush, Biden has never had a meeting with the Dalai Lama.\n\nAfter it is signed, the Resolve Tibet Act will serve as a potent declaration of the United States of America's commitment to the people of Tibet, according to Tibetan leaders, particularly the Central Tibetan Administration, or CTA.\n\nThe US has historically defended the Tibetan people's freedom to exercise their religion and culture, and it has charged China with violating such rights in the far-off Himalayan territory that shares a border with India.\n\nHowever, confusingly, the US also regards the Tibetan Autonomous Region as a part of China.\n\nPelosi's surprising attack not only strengthens India's stance against China, but it also highlights Washington's intention to prevent Beijing from interfering in the next Dalai Lama's appointment and coincides with US President Joe Biden's signing of a law compelling Beijing to resolve the Tibet problem.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, who will turn 89 next month, is customarily reincarnated, and he has stated that his successor might be found in India. But in keeping with a historical tradition, China maintains that the next Dalai Lama will be named by officially atheist Communist officials.\n\nCongressman Gregory Meeks (D-NY) headed the US team that arrived in India on Tuesday. At the airport in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, they were greeted by Tibetan officials, Buddhist monks and nuns, and schoolchildren. This visit precedes the Dalai Lama's visit to receive medical attention for a knee ailment.\n\nTheir visit is noteworthy because it coincides with efforts by Beijing and Washington to strengthen ties between these two military and economic superpowers.

While Tibetan leaders said they were never part of China, the Chinese claimed that Tibet had always been their part.\n\nThe representatives of China and Tibet signed the 17-Point Agreement in 1951, under which China pledged to keep Tibet's traditional government and religion in place, as per a Reuters backgrounder. This was after China had invaded Tibet in 1949-50, defeated its army, and established control over large parts of Tibetan territories.\n\nChina-Tibet 17-Point Agreement\n\nFrom 1912 to 1949 which marks the foundation of the People's Republic of China, no Chinese government took power control over what is today China's Tibet Autonomous Region. The Dalai Lama's government alone ruled the Tibet land until 1951.\n\nTibet remained an integral part of the Tibetans until \"Chinese\" Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army (PLA) marched in and Invaded the land. After occupying the eastern and northern fronts of Tibet, the Chinese signed the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet-- also called as '17-point agreement.'\n\nThe Dalai Lama with Mao Zedong | Image: File\n\nWith the position of strength at the negotiation table, Chinese claimed that the agreement was 'mutual.' Though the Tibetan government-in-exile later affirmed that it was signed under duress, a claim denied by the Chinese government.\n\nThe Tibetan Uprising: India's Role\n\nA crucial turning point came in 1959 amid escalating tensions between Tibet and China as Dalai Lama, along with Tibetans, fled to India seeking asylum. The Tibetans constituted an exiled government based in Dharamshala, India, known as the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).\n\nIn the aftermath, the Chinese government steadily tightened their grip on Tibet by improving infrastructure in the region. In Lhasa, the Chinese lawmakers encouraged entry of ethnic Han Chinese for making a demographic shift.\n\nThe presence of the Dalai Lama in the Indian territory has been a consistent irritant for the Chinese who considers him a separatist. For centuries, India's actual neighbour was Tibet, as most of country's boundaries and the 3500km LAC (Line of Actual Control) is with the Tibetan Autonomous Region, and not the rest of China.",

The bill now requires the signature of US President Joe Biden to become law.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian Tuesday urged Biden to not sign the bill and for the US to honour its commitments made to Beijing on Tibet during a regular press briefing. Beijing refers to Tibet as Xizang.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion... Xizang's affairs are purely China's domestic affairs and no external interference will ever be allowed,\" said Lin.\n\n\"The US must not sign the bill into law. China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" he added.\n\nMcCaul confirmed to the media Tuesday that Biden would soon sign the bill. The same was reiterated Wednesday during the public felicitation. A copy of the bill was handed over to the Dalai Lama by the delegation.\n\nUS officials have in the past too visited the Dalai Lama. However, the presence of Pelosi -- who as Speaker of the US House of Representatives was once third in line of precedence after the US President and Vice President -- in this delegation is contentious.\n\nIn 2022, as the Speaker of the House, Pelosi led a delegation to visit Taiwan, the self-governing territory that the US recognises as part of China. Beijing's response was swift, as it imposed restrictions on trade and military exercises conducted around the territory.\n\nTies between the US and China, two of the world's largest economies, remain frosty, with efforts being made by the Biden administration to stabilise the relationship.\n\nEvery US president except Donald Trump and Biden has met with the Tibetan spiritual leader in the last three decades. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule and has lived in India since.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors":

- World News", "body": "A group of senior U.S. lawmakers including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi met Wednesday with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, sparking heavy criticism from China.\n\nThe bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, led by Congressman Michael McCaul and Pelosi, visited the 88-year-old Buddhist spiritual leader at his home base in the northern Indian hill-town of Dharamsala.\n\nChina, which maintains Tibet is part of its territory, denounced \"external interference\" and said that matters in the Himalayan territory were \"purely China's domestic affairs.\"\n\nPelosi told crowds of Tibetans it was an \"honour\" to have met with the Dalai Lama, in a speech carried by the government-in-exile's Tibet TV.\n\n\"It is truly a blessing\", she said.\n\nThe visit follows the passage of a bill by the U.S. Congress that seeks to encourage China to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, frozen since 2010, and also as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.\n\n\"This bill is a message to the Chinese government, that we have clarity in our thinking and understanding in the issue of the freedom of Tibet\", she said.\n\n\"It says to the Chinese government: 'Things have changed now, get ready for that\", she added.\n\nPelosi said the bill was \"soon to be signed\" by U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nAhead of the visit, China's embassy in New Delhi criticised the meeting, saying the Dalai Lama was \"not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\".\n\nMany exiled Tibetans fear Beijing will name a rival successor to the Dalai Lama, bolstering control over a land it poured troops into in 1950.\n\nThe Dalai Lama was just 23 when he escaped the Tibetan capital Lhasa in fear for his life after Chinese soldiers eviscerated an uprising, crossing the snowy Himalayas into India.\n\n\"The whole world, we are same human beings, we all have same right -- and this world belongs to humanity,\" the Dalai Lama told the delegates, dressed in flowing red robes and draped in a yellow wrap.\n\n\"We should take care of this world,\" he added, in a video broadcast by the exiled government.\n\n\"People of the world should be peaceful, happy,\" he said.\n\nHe stepped down as his people's political head in 2011, passing the baton of secular power to a government chosen democratically by some 130,000 Tibetans around the world.\n\nPenpa Tsering, the sikyong or head of that government, said it does not seek full independence for Tibet, but rather to pursue a long-standing \"Middle Way\" policy seeking greater autonomy and \"to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict through dialogue\".\n\nBut Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused the Tibetan administration of seeking to break away.\n\n\"We urge the U.S. side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group,\" he said, reiterating Beijing's oft-repeated position that the high-altitude territory \"has always been part\" of China.\n\n\"The U.S. must not sign the bill into law,\" Lin added.\n\n\"China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\"", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

senior US lawmakers including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi met Wednesday with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, sparking heavy criticism from China.\n\nThe bipartisan group of US lawmakers, led by Congressman Michael McCaul and Pelosi, visited the 88-year-old Buddhist spiritual leader at his home base in the northern Indian hill-town of Dharamsala.\n\nChina, which maintains Tibet is part of its territory, denounced \"external interference\" and said that matters in the Himalayan territory were \"purely China's domestic affairs.\"\n\nPelosi told crowds of Tibetans it was an \"honour\" to have met with the Dalai Lama, in a speech carried by the government-in-exile's Tibet TV.\n\n\"It is truly a blessing\", she said.\n\nThe visit follows the passage of a bill by the US Congress that seeks to encourage China to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, frozen since 2010, and also as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.\n\n\"This bill is a message to the Chinese government, that we have clarity in our thinking and understanding in the issue of the freedom of Tibet\", she said.\n\n\"It says to the Chinese government: 'Things have changed now, get ready for that\", she added.\n\nPelosi said the bill was \"soon to be signed\" by US President Joe Biden.\n\nAhead of the visit, China's embassy in New Delhi criticised the meeting, saying the Dalai Lama was \"not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\".\n\n- 'Peaceful, happy' -\n\nMany exiled Tibetans fear Beijing will name a rival successor to the Dalai Lama, bolstering control over a land it poured troops into in 1950.\n\nThe Dalai Lama was just 23 when he escaped the Tibetan capital Lhasa in fear for his life after Chinese soldiers eviscerated an uprising, crossing the snowy Himalayas into India.\n\n\"The whole world, we are same human beings, we all have same right -- and this world belongs to humanity,\" the Dalai Lama told the delegates, dressed in flowing red robes and draped in a yellow wrap.\n\n\"We should take care of this world,\" he added, in a video broadcast by the exiled government.\n\n\"People of the world should be peaceful, happy,\" he said.\n\nHe stepped down as his people's political head in 2011, passing the baton of secular power to a government chosen democratically by some 130,000 Tibetans around the world.\n\nPenpa Tsering, the sikyong or head of that government, said it does not seek full independence for Tibet, but rather to pursue a long-standing \"Middle Way\" policy seeking greater autonomy and \"to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict through dialogue\".\n\nBut Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused the Tibetan administration of seeking to break away.\n\n\"We urge the US side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group,\" he said, reiterating Beijing's oft-repeated position that the high-altitude territory \"has always been part\" of China.\n\n\"The US must not sign the bill into law,\" Lin added.\n\n\"China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc",

He appreciated their \"strong and continued\" support for the strategic partnership between India and the US.\n\nThe US Congressional delegation includes former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, US Representatives - Gregory Meeks, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Ami Bera and Jim McGovern.\n\nIn a post on X, Jaishankar stated, \"Pleasure to meet with the bipartisan US Congressional delegation led by @RepMcCaul. Thank @SpeakerPelosi, @RepGregoryMeeks, @RepMMM, @NMalliotakis, @RepBera and @RepMcGovern for joining. Appreciate their strong and continued support for the strategic partnership.\"\n\nThe US Congressional delegation, which arrived in India on Tuesday, was received by officials of the Central Tibetan Administration at Himachal Pradesh's Kangra Airport. Upon arrival, the US lawmakers headed to Dharamshala to meet Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama.\n\nOn Wednesday, the high-level US Congressional delegation, led by US Congressman Michael McCaul, met Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamshala.\n\nBefore meeting the Dalai Lama, the US delegates attended a public felicitation programme at the main Tibetan temple. The disciples of the Dalai Lama were also seen in the temple complex this morning. Children performed and displayed Tibetan culture at the felicitation ceremony in the courtyard of the Tsuglagkhang Complex in Dharamshala.\n\nDuring their meeting at his residence in Dharamshala today, McCaul presented Dalai Lama with a framed copy of The Resolve Tibet Act, a bipartisan bill passed by the US Congress to enhance US support for Tibet.\n\nLast week, the US Congress passed a bill urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet.\n\nThe legislation rejects Beijing's stance that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times and urges China to \"cease its propagation of disinformation about the history of Tibet, the Tibetan people, and Tibetan institutions, including that of the Dalai Lama,\" Radio Free Asia reported.\n\nThe Dalai Lama presented Buddha Statue to Pelosi at the end of the meeting with the US Congressional delegation, the office of the Dalai Lama said.\n\nThe members of the US Congressional delegation also posed for a group photo with the Tibetan spiritual leader after their meeting.\n\n(With Inputs From Agencies)\n\nComments", "source":

The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday morning. Dharmasala is the seat of Tibet's government in exile.\n\nChina also urged President Biden not to sign the Tibet policy bill, which seeks to counter Chinese disinformation on Tibet.\n\nAbout People Involved In The US Delegation\n\nApart from McCaul, the US delegation consists of six more prominent US Congressional members, namely, Nancy Pelosi (Speaker emeritus), Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern, and Ami Bera.\n\nAfter arrival at the Gaggal Airport here, McCaul expressed enthusiasm about the visit and said, \"We are excited at the prospect of meeting His Holiness the Dalai Lama and talk about many things, including the bill which was passed by the Congress; it essentially says that the United States of America stands with the people of Tibet.\"\n\nAsked if US President Joe Biden would sign the bill, McCaul said, \"Yes, he will.\"\n\nChina Warns Of Resolute Measures\n\nChina also warned of \"resolute measures\" in case the bill was signed. The bill would direct funds to counter what it calls \"disinformation\" from Beijing about Tibet's history, people, and institutions.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, while reacting to the US delegation visit, told a media briefing here: \"The 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion.\"\n\n\"We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honour the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world\", he said.\n\nClaiming that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times, Lin said it always remained China's territory and \"Tibet-related affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no external interference.\"\n\n\"No one and no force should ever attempt to destabilise Tibet to contain and suppress China. Such attempts will never succeed,\" he said.\n\n\"We urge the US side to adhere to its commitments of recognising Xizang as part of China and not to support 'Xizang independence.' The US must not sign the bill into law. China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security, and development interests,\" he said without elaborating.\n\nChina On Holding Talks With Officials Of The Tibetan Govt In Exile\n\nChina in April this year said it would talk only with the representatives of the Dalai Lama and not the officials of the Tibetan government in exile based in India. At the same time, China ruled out dialogue on the Dalai Lama's long-pending demand for autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland. After a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and came to India where he set up the government-in-exile.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news",

Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, arrived Tuesday in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala, where the Dalai Lama has lived since the 1960s.The delegation visited the offices of the Tibetan government in exile, which is pushing for autonomy for Tibet within China.\n\nThe trip comes days after Congress passed a bill with bipartisan support that urged China to start dialogue with Tibetan leaders to find a solution to the long-standing conflict.\n\nChina's criticism of the visit was immediate and unsurprising. Its leaders consider the government in exile illegal and regard any support for the cause of autonomy for Tibet, which they call Xizang, as interference in internal Chinese matters.\n\n\"We urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said in a statement Tuesday night.\n\nUS officials have often met with the Dalai Lama, 88. Pelosi's presence in the delegation, however, brought reminders of her 2022 trip to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its territory, when she was still speaker of the House.\n\nThat contentious visit, which raised fears within the Biden administration of further deteriorating a frosty relationship with Beijing, led to a sharp response from China, including trade restrictions on Taiwan and military exercises near the island.\n\nThe visit to India also comes as Washington and New Delhi deepen their relationship, motivated in part by the perception of a shared Chinese threat. Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden's national security adviser, is in New Delhi this week, holding multiple rounds of talks with Indian officials on expanding defense and technology cooperation.\n\nThose extensive discussions, coming weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a third term in office, indicate how much Washington prioritizes the relationship with India, with US officials increasingly speaking of New Delhi as a counterweight to Beijing.\n\nTenzin Lekshay, a spokesperson for the Central Tibetan Administration, the government in exile, said Tibet's situation should not be seen through \"the lens of increasing rivalry between the US and China,\" but as a reminder of how the Tibetan way of life \"is facing an existential threat\" as China assimilates the region.\n\n\"We do hope that leaders of the free world will stand for the Tibet cause, particularly stressing the Chinese leadership to reinstall the dialogue to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict,\"

This event has aligned with the presence of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in Dharamshala and the visit of the US Congressional delegation, amidst various factors including the oracle's schedule.\"\n\nTenzin Lekshay, spokesperson of the Tibetan government-in-exile, expressed jubilation over the delegation's visit and its potential impact, stating, \"It is a very great moment for us. The high-level US Congressional delegation has already met His Holiness, followed by a public felicitation ceremony in the main temple courtyard.\" Lekshay underscored the delegation's support and solidarity, noting the progress of the Resolve Tibet Act in the US Congress, which awaits President Biden's signature. \"This legislative support is crucial for us,\" he affirmed.\n\nRegarding China's reaction to international support for Tibet, Lekshay remarked, \"Whenever we take steps forward, China expresses unhappiness. They should reflect on their actions in Tibet over the last several decades, which have prioritised their own interests over fulfilling Tibetan aspirations.\" He emphasised the need for resolution in the China-Tibet conflict to address Tibetan people's long-standing aspirations.\n\nLekshay also acknowledged India's pivotal role in supporting Tibetan refugees, stating, \"India has been the best host for us, and we are grateful to the Indian government and public. The Tibetan issue is not just a concern for Tibetans alone; India also has a stake in it, and awareness among the Indian populace is crucial.\"\n\nThe visit comes amidst ongoing global attention to human rights issues in Tibet and growing international calls for dialogue and resolution.

including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi met on Wednesday with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, sparking heavy criticism from China.\n\nThe bipartisan group of US lawmakers, led by Congressman Michael McCaul and Pelosi, visited the 88-year-old Buddhist spiritual leader at his home base in the northern Indian hill-town of Dharamsala.\n\nPelosi told crowds of Tibetans it was an \"honour\" to have met with the Dali Lama, in a speech carried by the government-in-exile's Tibet TV.\n\n\"It is truly a blessing\", Pelosi said.\n\nThe visit follows the passage of a bill by the US Congress that seeks to encourage Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders - frozen since 2010.\n\n\"This bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and understanding in the issue of the freedom of Tibet,\" she said.\n\nREAD | Dalai Lama 'unfairly labelled' over tongue video - Tibet govt-in-exile\n\nPelosi said the bill was \"soon to be signed\" by US President Joe Biden.\n\nAhead of the visit, China's embassy in New Delhi criticised the meeting, saying the Dalai Lama was \"not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\".\n\nMany exiled Tibetans fear Beijing will name a rival successor to the Dalai Lama, bolstering control over a land it poured troops into in 1950.\n\nThe Dalai Lama was just 23 when he escaped the Tibetan capital Lhasa in fear for his life after Chinese soldiers eviscerated an uprising against Beijing's forces, crossing the snowy Himalayas into India.\n\nHe stepped down as his people's political head in 2011, passing the baton of secular power to a government chosen democratically by some 130 000 Tibetans around the world.\n\n\"The democracy of the diaspora of the Tibetans in exile is very important to us,\" Pelosi said.\n\nPenpa Tsering, the sikyong or head of that government, said it does not seek full independence for Tibet, but rather to pursue a long-standing \"Middle Way\" policy seeking greater autonomy and \"to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict through dialogue\".\n\nBut Beijing's embassy accused the Tibetan administration of seeking to break away.\n\n\"We urge the US side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group,\" the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in India wrote on social media late on Tuesday.\n\nIt reiterated its oft-repeated position that the high-altitude territory \"has always been part of China since ancient times\".", "source": {"uri":

Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognise and views as a violation of China's constitution.\n\nYet China continues to chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries, including former US presidents, even though the Dalai Lama says he is not seeking independence for Tibet.\n\nThe 88-year-old, whom China sees as a dangerous separatist in a monk's robes, remains the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.\n\nUS lawmakers are currently asking President Joe Biden to sign a bill aimed at pressing

The delegation, led by Republican Michael McCaul, had met the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, a day earlier, infuriating Beijing.\n\nThe delegation, which included former US House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi and other prominent members, described India-US relations as crucial and expressed strong support for deepening the Comprehensive Strategic Global Partnership in areas like trade, technology, and defense. They congratulated Modi on his historic third consecutive term and praised the fairness of India's recent elections.\n\nModi highlighted the bipartisan support of the US Congress in advancing India-US ties, based on shared democratic values and strong people-to-people connections. He reiterated his commitment to strengthening bilateral relations for global benefit, recalling his State Visit to the US last year.\n\nPelosi, during her visit to Dharamsala, criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping and expressed support for the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan cause. The visit coincided with the US Congress passing the Resolve Tibet Act, which urges China to resume negotiations with Tibetan leaders.\n\nChina's foreign ministry urged President Biden not to sign the bipartisan Tibet Policy Bill, reiterating that Tibet's affairs are China's domestic matters and warning against external interference.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, regarded as the supreme Tibetan spiritual leader, fled to India in 1959 following a failed revolt against Chinese rule. Based in Dharamsala, his advanced age has raised concerns about the selection of his successor, a potential flashpoint between Beijing and the exiled Tibetan community.\n\nIndia recognises Tibet as part of China but considers the Dalai Lama an \"honoured guest\" and a \"religious leader\" with a significant following.

Formal discussions have been stalled since 2010.

The Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognise and views as a violation of China's constitution.\n\nYet China continues to chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries, including former U.S. presidents, even though the Dalai Lama says he is not seeking independence for Tibet. The 88-year-old, whom China sees as a dangerous separatist in a monk's robes, remains the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are currently asking President Joe Biden to sign a bill aimed at pressing China to secure a negotiated and peaceful agreement on Tibet. While Washington recognises Tibet as a part of China, the bill appears to question that position, analysts say.\n\nBeijing has rejected the Resolve Tibet Act, saying Tibet is part of China and brooks no interference from external forces. \"We urge the United States to fully recognise the importance and sensitivity of Tibet-related issues and earnestly respect China's core interests,\" Lin said.\n\n\"We should abide by our commitment on the issue of obstacles, refrain from any form of contact with the Dalai clique, and stop sending wrong messages to the outside world.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "14th Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Tibetan_Administration", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Tibetan Administration"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State Council of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical_Intermediates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical Intermediates", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/20_06_2024_14_18_09_5051707.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

lawmakers' visit to Dalai Lama sparks China criticism", "body": "A Tibetan boy in India's hill town of Dharamsala attends a rally marking 65 years since the failed uprising against Chinese soldiers in Lhasa in 1959\n\nA group of senior US lawmakers including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi met Wednesday with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, sparking heavy criticism from China.\n\nThe bipartisan group of US lawmakers, led by Congressman Michael McCaul and Pelosi, visited the 88-year-old Buddhist spiritual leader at his home base in the northern Indian hill-town of Dharamsala.\n\nChina, which maintains Tibet is part of its territory, denounced \"external interference\" and said that matters in the Himalayan territory were \"purely China's domestic affairs.\"\n\nPelosi told crowds of Tibetans it was an \"honour\" to have met with the Dalai Lama, in a speech carried by the government-in-exile's Tibet TV.\n\n\"It is truly a blessing\", she said.\n\nThe visit follows the passage of a bill by the US Congress that seeks to encourage China to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, frozen since 2010, and also as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.\n\n\"This bill is a message to the Chinese government, that we have clarity in our thinking and understanding in the issue of the freedom of Tibet\", she said.\n\n\"It says to the Chinese government: 'Things have changed now, get ready for that\", she added.\n\nPelosi said the bill was \"soon to be signed\" by US President Joe Biden.\n\nAhead of the visit, China's embassy in New Delhi criticised the meeting, saying the Dalai Lama was \"not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\".\n\n- 'Peaceful, happy' -\n\nMany exiled Tibetans fear Beijing will name a rival successor to the Dalai Lama, bolstering control over a land it poured troops into in 1950.\n\nMore from this section Rates of

Dalai Lama was just 23 when he escaped the Tibetan capital Lhasa in fear for his life after Chinese soldiers eviscerated an uprising, crossing the snowy Himalayas into India.\n\n\"The whole world, we are same human beings, we all have same right -- and this world belongs to humanity,\" the Dalai Lama told the delegates, dressed in flowing red robes and draped in a yellow wrap.\n\n\"We should take care of this world,\" he added, in a video broadcast by the exiled government.\n\n\"People of the world should be peaceful, happy,\" he said.\n\nHe stepped down as his people's political head in 2011, passing the baton of secular power to a government chosen democratically by some 130,000 Tibetans around the world.\n\nPenpa Tsering, the sikyong or head of that government, said it does not seek full independence for Tibet, but rather to pursue a long-standing \"Middle Way\" policy seeking greater autonomy and \"to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict through dialogue\".\n\nBut Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused the Tibetan administration of seeking to break away.\n\n\"We urge the US side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group,\" he said, reiterating Beijing's oft-repeated position that the high-altitude territory \"has always been part\" of China.\n\n\"The US must not sign the bill into law,\" Lin added.\n\n\"China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\"\n\nburs-pjm/ser", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

ANI\n\nA high-level US congressional delegation, including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, met the Dalai Lama at his residence in Himachal Pradesh's Dharamshala on Wednesday, drawing a sharp criticism in advance from the Chinese government which views the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader as a separatist.\n\nLed by Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the delegation arrived in Dharamshala on Tuesday, which has been the Dalai Lama's home since the 1960s.\n\nDuring their visit, the delegation also met with representatives of the Tibetan government in exile, which advocates for Tibetan autonomy under Chinese rule.\n\nThe congressional visit comes after the recent passage of a bipartisan bill urging China to engage in dialogue with Tibetan leaders to address longstanding conflicts.\n\nChina's criticism of the visit was immediate and unsurprising. Its leaders consider the government in exile illegal and regard any support for the cause of autonomy for Tibet, which they call Xizang, as interference in internal Chinese matters.\n\n\"We urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" The New York Times report the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi as saying in a statement on Tuesday night.\n\nUS officials have frequently engaged with the 88-year-old Dalai Lama. However, Pelosi's inclusion in the delegation brought reminders of her 2022 visit to Taiwan, the independently governed island that China claims as its territory, during her tenure as House Speaker.\n\nThis controversial visit sparked concerns within the Biden administration about further straining an already chilly relationship with Beijing. China responded sharply, imposing trade restrictions on Taiwan and conducting military exercises near the island.\n\nAccording to The New York Times report, the delegation's trip to India coincides with deepening ties between Washington and New Delhi, partly driven by a perceived common threat posed by China. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser, is currently in New Delhi, engaging in multiple rounds of discussions with Indian officials aimed at expanding defense and technology cooperation.\n\nThese extensive talks, taking place shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi secured a third term, underscore Washington's prioritisation of its relationship with India. American officials increasingly view New Delhi as a strategic counterbalance to Beijing, added the report.\n\nTenzin Lekshay, a spokesman for the Central Tibetan Administration, the government in exile, said that Tibet's situation should not be seen through \"the lens of increasing rivalry between the US and China,\" but as a reminder of how the Tibetan way of life \"is facing an existential threat\" as China assimilates the region.\n\n\"We do hope that leaders of the free world will stand for the Tibet cause, particularly stressing the Chinese leadership to reinstall the dialogue to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict,\" The New York Times report quoted Lekshay as saying.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The delegation, comprising six prominent US Congressional members, namely \"former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera,\" also had an audience with Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday.\n\nRepresentative McCaul presented the Dalai Lama with a framed copy of 'The Resolve Tibet Act,' a bipartisan bill recently passed by the US Congress aimed at strengthening US support for Tibet.\n\nLast week, the US Congress approved the bill, urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet.\n\nPrior to their meeting with the Dalai Lama, the US delegates attended a public felicitation programme at the main Tibetan temple. Children showcased Tibetan culture through performances at the felicitation ceremony held in the courtyard of the Tsuglagkhang Complex in Dharamshala. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Dalai Lama presented a Buddha Statue to Pelosi, as reported by the office of the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

A bipartisan US Congressional delegation led by Congressman Michael McCaul and also included former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived in Dharamshala and met with the Dalai Lama.\n\nExpressing satisfaction with this recent visit, the Tibetan leader called it a significant bipartisan gesture of support for Tibet. \"I am very happy with the US delegation led by leader Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the Congress, and the chairman Michael McCaul of this housewarming relations Committee,\" Sangay remarked. \"It's a very powerhouse, bipartisan both Republican Democrats have come all the way across continents to come to Dharamshala, meet with his holiness, get his blessing, that is, to demonstrate the US government and people's support for Tibet. So this is a big deal.\"\n\nHe emphasised the delegation's symbolic impact, stating, \"They sent a very powerful message to Beijing that you will try to occupy, continue to occupy and repress Tibetans, but America will keep speaking for truth and justice.\" Earlier this week, the US Congress passed a bill urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet, Radio Free Asia reported.\n\n'The Resolve Tibet Act' urges Beijing to re-engage with Tibetan leaders for a peaceful resolution of their governance dispute with China. Regarding pending legislation, Sangay expressed optimism about President JpoeBiden signing an act related to Tibet's historical status on July 6, coinciding with the Dalai Lama's birthday. \"The act is very powerful because it talks about the historical status of Tibet being an independent country and Tibetans, as per international law, deserving self-determination,\" he explained. \"It is in China's interest to talk, to have dialogue with the envoys of the Dalai Lama to resolve the issue of Tibet peacefully.\"\n\nThe delegation on Thursday also met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. US Representatives - Gregory Meeks, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Ami Bera and Jim McGovern are the other members of the visiting delegation.\n\nOn India's support, the Tibetan leader in-exile noted, \"The fact that the US delegation led by Nancy Pelosi and Chairman Michael McCall was received and met by Prime Minister Modi and Foreign Minister S Jaishankar clearly indicates that India is saying, we are with you to the Tibetan people and to the US delegation.\" (ANI)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

criticism", "body": "The bipartisan group of US lawmakers, led by Congressman Michael McCaul and Pelosi, visited the 88-year-old Buddhist spiritual leader at his home base in the northern Indian hill-town of Dharamsala.\n\nChina, which maintains Tibet is part of its territory, denounced \"external interference\" and said that matters in the Himalayan territory were \"purely China's domestic affairs.\"\n\nPelosi told crowds of Tibetans it was an \"honour\" to have met with the Dalai Lama, in a speech carried by the government-in-exile's Tibet TV.\n\n\"It is truly a blessing\", she said.\n\nThe visit follows the passage of a bill by the US Congress that seeks to encourage China to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, frozen since 2010, and also as Washington seeks to ease tensions with Beijing.\n\n\"This bill is a message to the Chinese government, that we have clarity in our thinking and understanding in the issue of the freedom of Tibet\", she said.\n\n\"It says to the Chinese government: 'Things have changed now, get ready for that\", she added.\n\nPelosi said the bill was \"soon to be signed\" by US President Joe Biden.\n\nAhead of the visit, China's embassy in New Delhi criticised the meeting, saying the Dalai Lama was \"not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\".\n\n- 'Peaceful, happy' -\n\nMany exiled Tibetans fear Beijing will name a rival successor to the Dalai Lama, bolstering control over a land it poured troops into in 1950.\n\nThe Dalai Lama was just 23 when he escaped the Tibetan capital Lhasa in fear for his life after Chinese soldiers eviscerated an uprising, crossing the snowy Himalayas into India.\n\n\"The whole world, we are same human beings, we all have same right -- and this world belongs to humanity,\" the Dalai Lama told the delegates, dressed in flowing red robes and draped in a yellow wrap.\n\n\"We should take care of this world,\" he added, in a video broadcast by the exiled government.\n\n\"People of the world should be peaceful, happy,\" he said.\n\nHe stepped down as his people's political head in 2011, passing the baton of secular power to a government chosen democratically by some 130,000 Tibetans around the world.\n\nPenpa Tsering, the sikyong or head of that government, said it does not seek full independence for Tibet, but rather to pursue a long-standing \"Middle Way\" policy seeking greater autonomy and \"to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict through dialogue\".\n\nBut Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused the Tibetan administration of seeking to break away.\n\n\"We urge the US side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group,\" he said, reiterating Beijing's oft-repeated position that the high-altitude territory \"has always been part\" of China.\n\n\"The US must not sign the bill into law,\" Lin added.\n\n\"China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\"\n\nburs-pjm/ser", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The delegation visited the offices of the Tibetan government in exile, which is pushing for autonomy for Tibet within China.\n\nThe trip comes days after Congress passed a bill with bipartisan support that urged China to start dialogue with Tibetan leaders to find a solution to the longstanding conflict.\n\nChina's criticism of the visit was immediate and unsurprising. Its leaders consider the government in exile illegal and regard any support for the cause of autonomy for Tibet, which they call Xizang, as interference in internal Chinese matters.\n\n\"We urge the U.S. side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the U.S. has made to China on issues related to Xizang, stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said in a statement on Tuesday night.\n\nU.S. officials have often met with the Dalai Lama, 88. Ms. Pelosi's presence in the delegation, however, brought reminders of her 2022 trip to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its territory, when she was still speaker of the House.\n\nThat contentious visit, which raised fears within the Biden administration of further deteriorating an already frosty relationship with Beijing, led to a sharp response from China, including trade restrictions on Taiwan and military exercises near the island.\n\nThe visit to India also comes as Washington and New Delhi deepen their relationship, motivated in part by the perception of a shared Chinese threat. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser, is in New Delhi this week, holding multiple rounds of talks with Indian officials on expanding defense and technology cooperation.\n\nThose extensive discussions, coming weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a third term in office, indicate how much Washington prioritizes the relationship with India, with American officials increasingly speaking of New Delhi as a counterweight to Beijing.\n\nTenzin Lekshay, a spokesman for the Central Tibetan Administration, the government in exile, said that Tibet's situation should not be seen through \"the lens of increasing rivalry between the U.S. and China,\" but as a reminder of how the Tibetan way of life \"is facing an existential threat\" as China assimilates the region.\n\n\"We do hope that leaders of the free world will stand for the Tibet cause, particularly stressing the Chinese leadership to reinstall the dialogue to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict,\" Mr. Lekshay said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score":

Pelosi has been at the forefront of challenging Beijing, as she visited Taiwan in August 2022.\n\nPelosi, addressing Tibetans in Dharamsala, said: His Holiness the Dalai Lama, with his message of knowledge, tradition, compassion, purity of soul and love, will live long and his legacy will live forever. But you, the Chinese president, will leave and no one will give you credit for anything.\n\nShe also said the Dalai Lama would not approve of her comments against the Chinese. When I criticize the Chinese government, he said, let's pray that Nancy rids her of her negative attitudes. Separately, US Congressional Representative Gregory Meeks said China can express its dissatisfaction if it wishes. We will stand up for what is right. What is right is to guarantee the freedom of Tibetans. They can return to their homeland and maintain their culture and history... That's what's important.\n\nLast week, the US Congress passed a bill urging Beijing to re-engage with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders to peacefully resolve their dispute over the status and governance of Tibet. The US House of Representatives has passed the bill promoting a resolution on the Tibet issue. -The China Dispute Act, also known as the Resolve Tibet Act, and it must now be signed by President Joe Biden to become law. You heard our colleagues talk about this bill passed last week. We have been fighting this for a long time and in the spirituality of His Holiness, through maneuvering within Congress, we have made progress. \"But it's different now with the passage of this bill (Resolve Tibet Act) because this bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of freedom of Tibet,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThis bill says to the Chinese government: things have changed now, prepare for this, she said. McCaul, the Republican representative, said he reaffirmed U.S. support for the Tibetans' right to self-determination.\n\nJust this week, our delegation received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party warning us not to come here... but we did not let the CCP intimidate us because we are here today, he said.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in New Delhi reacted strongly to the delegation's visit on Tuesday and urged the US side to adhere to its commitments to recognize Xizang as part of China. China officially calls Tibet Xizang. China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests, said the Chinese Embassy spokesperson. The spokesperson said: \"Everyone knows that the 14th #Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities... We urge the US side to fully recognize the separatist nature anti-China group of the Dalai Lama and to honor the commitments that the United States has made to China on issues related to Xizang...",

Chinese officials chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has met U.S. officials, including presidents, during previous visits to the United States, but Biden has not met him since taking office in 2021.\n\nHe is due to fly to the U.S. this week for medical treatment, but it is unclear if he will have any engagements then.\n\nReporting by Charlotte Greenfield in Dharamsala, India;

Michael McCaul (R-TX) and including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) met with the Dalai Lama, the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, on Wednesday in a display of solidarity against Chinese occupation.\n\nThe visit prompted an irate reaction from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which urged the lawmakers not to make any contact with the Dalai Lama - who it derisively called a \"political exile\" - and insisted the world respect its occupation of \"Xizang,\" using the Han Chinese colonialist name for Tibet. Beijing has not at press time taken any concrete measures against the U.S. government, however.\n\nRep. Pelosi's presence on the trip is a particular irritant to Beijing. Among her final acts as Speaker of the House in 2022 was a much publicized visit to Taiwan, a sovereign state that the Chinese Communist Party falsely claims as a province under Beijing. Rep. Pelosi's meeting with then-President Tsai Ing-wen and support for Taiwan's autonomy outraged China and prompted it to suspend talks with Washington on multiple issues of interest to the administration of President Joe Biden, such as climate change and illegal immigration.\n\nIn addition to her audience with the Dalai Lama, Rep. Pelosi addressed the Tibetan parliament in exile in India on Tuesday, effectively recognizing that Taiwan is an occupied nation rather than a province of China.\n\nCommunist China under Mao Zedong occupied Tibet shortly after its founding and has for decades repressed the local culture. Under current genocidal dictator Xi Jinping, Chinese authorities have gone further than before, not just outlawing Tibetan Buddhism but forcing children to learn Mandarin rather than Tibetan and imposing a \"boarding school\" system where children are abducted and indoctrinated by Han communist teachers.\n\nIn a particularly grave offense to Tibetans, the Chinese government abducted and disappeared a six-year-old boy identified as the Panchen Lama, a living Buddha on par with the Dalai Lama, in 1995, and has since insisted that the Chinese government is the only entity allowed to identify reincarnated Panchen Lamas and that the Dalai Lama himself may have no role in choosing who he reincarnates into (reincarnation is a core belief of Tibetan Buddhism).\n\nThe Congressional delegation is in India and met with the spiritual leader in Dharamshala, where he is based, shortly before the Dalai Lama is expected in the United States to receive medical treatment. Lawmakers expressed support for Tibet against decades of Chinese communist repression and reportedly brought the Dalai Lama a copy of the \"Resolve Tibet Act,\" a bill recently passed but yet to be signed by Biden that would call for the State Department to more aggressively reject China's claims to Tibet and demand Beijing \"negotiate\" with the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's social media pages published a group photo with the lawmakers holding up the bill in approval.\n\nIn addition to Reps. McCaul and Pelosi, the delegation included Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), and Rep. Ami Bera (D-CA).\n\n\"We are very excited to see His Holiness tomorrow to talk about many things, including the bill that just passed out of Congress that basically says that the United States of America stands with the people of Tibet,\" Rep. McCaul said to reporters upon arriving in Dharamshala on Tuesday.\n\nRep. McCaul also said he believed Biden would sign the Resolve Tibet Act.\n\nAsked about the visit on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian strongly condemned it and ordered the U.S. government not to pass the Resolve Tibet Act.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin said. \"We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group.\"\n\n\"On the relevant act in the US Congress, let me stress that Xizang has always been part of China since ancient times,\" Lin claimed. \"Xizang's affairs are purely China's domestic affairs and no external interference will ever be allowed.\"\n\n\"We urge the US side to adhere to its commitments of recognizing Xizang as part of China and not supporting 'Xizang independence,'\" he claimed. \"The US must not sign the bill into law. China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\"\n\nLin did not offer any specifics on the kind of measures the Chinese Communist Party is reportedly considering in response to the bill.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry's response to the Dalai Lama meeting was more reserved than its unhinged outburst over Rep. Pelosi's 2022 visit to Taiwan, which prompted state propagandists to urge Beijing to shoot down Rep. Pelosi's plane and a torrent of insults linking the visit to irrelevant issues such as the death of Minnesota man George Floyd.\n\n\"The world must never allow the US to see itself as a 'world policeman' or an 'international judge' and continue to treat other sovereign nations like George Floyd as if the US can just bully and strangle them at will,\" Hua Chunying, one of China's most senior Foreign Ministry officials, said at the time in response to Rep. Pelosi traveling to Taiwan.\n\nRep. Pelosi responded to the Chinese government's \"big fuss\" by telling reports in Taipei that China's opinion on her travels \"doesn't really matter.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType":

The team, led by Michael McCaul, a Republican representative from Texas, who also chairs the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, includes Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIssues the lawmakers are set to discuss with the Dalai Lama include a U.S. bill that aims to press China to resolve the Tibet dispute and awaits President Joe Biden's signature, McCaul said on Tuesday. Beijing, which calls the Dalai Lama a dangerous \"splittist\" or separatist, said it was seriously concerned about the visit and the bill.\n\nIt urged the lawmakers not to make contact with what it calls the \"Dalai clique\" and Biden not to sign the bill. The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet. Chinese officials chafe at any interaction he has with officials of other countries.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has met U.S. officials, including presidents, during previous visits to the United States, but Biden has not met him since taking office in 2021.

Latest news, views, gossip, photos and video", "body": "Senior US lawmakers, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, met with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile in India on Wednesday, drawing strong criticism from China.\n\nThe bipartisan party of US politicians, led by Congressman Michael McCaul and Pelosi, paid a visit to the 88-year-old Buddhist spiritual leader at his home base in Dharamsala, a hill town in northern India.\n\nIn an address broadcast on the government-in-exile's Tibet TV, Pelosi told a crowd of Tibetans that seeing the Dalai Lama was a \"honour.\"\n\n\"It is truly a blessing\", Pelosi said.\n\nThe visit follows the passage of a bill by the US Congress that seeks to encourage Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders -- frozen since 2010.\n\n\"This bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and understanding in the issue of the freedom of Tibet\", she said.\n\nPelosi said the bill was \"soon to be signed\" by US President Joe Biden.\n\nPrior to the visit, China's embassy in New Delhi criticized the meeting, claiming that the Dalai Lama was \"not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\".\n\nMany exiled Tibetans are concerned that Beijing may appoint a competing successor to the Dalai Lama, so consolidating control over a territory into which it poured troops in 1950.\n\nThe Dalai Lama was only 23 years old when he fled Tibet's capital, Lhasa, in fear for his life after Chinese soldiers crushed an uprising against Beijing's forces, crossing the steep Himalayas into India.\n\nHe stood down as his people's political leader in 2011, handing up secular power to a democratically elected government of around 130,000 Tibetans worldwide.\n\n\"The democracy of the diaspora of the Tibetans in exile is very important to us,\" Pelosi said.\n\nPenpa Tsering, the sikyong or head of that government, said it does not seek full independence for Tibet, but rather to pursue a long-standing \"Middle Way\" policy seeking greater autonomy and \"to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict through dialogue\".\n\nBut Beijing's embassy accused the Tibetan administration of seeking to break away.\n\n\"We urge the US side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group,\" the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in India wrote on social media late Tuesday.\n\nIt reiterated its oft-repeated position that the high-altitude territory \"has always been part of China since ancient times.\"", "source": {"uri": "howafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "How Africa News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score":

Prominent members of the delegation, including Michael McCaul and Nancy Pelosi, openly challenged China's policy on Tibet and called for renewed dialogue with the Dalai Lama.\n\nBeijing has urged US President Joe Biden not to sign the Tibet policy bill, cautioning against sending misleading signals to the world about Tibet. The new law aims to counter China's assertions on its control of Tibet and fosters dialogue with the Dalai Lama, who has been in India since his escape from Tibet in 1959.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/20_06_2024_14_18_09_5051707.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

You should be able to freely practise your religion and that is why we are here today in defiance of the CCP warning,\" he said.\n\n\"Our delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here. They repeated their false claim that Tibet is part of China since the 13th century but we did not let the CCP intimidate us and we are here today,\" he said at the event organised by the Dharamsala-based Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).\n\nHe added that the Dalai Lama, the people of Tibet and the US know that Tibet is not part of China.\n\nThe US delegation included Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera.\n\nAt his resident, the Dalai Lama told them that he wanted people of the world to be happy and peaceful.\n\n\"We are the same human beings, we all have the same rights and this world belongs to humanity. We should take care of the world irrespective of religion and tradition,\" he was heard saying in a video clip.\n\nReferring to the Tibet policy bill, McCaul said at the later event that the timing of the visit could not be better. The bill also required aggressively challenging the CCP \"propaganda\" on Tibet, he added.\n\n\"I presented the Dalai Lama with a wind chime, which will remind him of our support,\" he said.\n\n\"Like many of you, I wish that this meeting was happening in your homeland of Tibet, but 65 years ago you were forced to flee after the Chinese Communist Party annexed Tibet and slaughtered tens of thousands of Tibetan people,\" he said.\n\nThe delegation leader claimed that the CCP was determined to eliminate Tibetan culture and forcibly bring the Tibetan people under its control.\n\nThanks to the kindness of the Indian people the Tibetans who fled their homeland are able to live freely in this country and practise their religion without fear of persecution.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day His Holiness the Dalai Lama and his people will return to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul said.\n\nHe said the CCP continues to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people decades later, and accused China of interfering with the process of finding a successor to the Dalai Lama.

Pelosi Meets With Exiled Tibetan Government in India as China's Xi Visits Tibet", "body": "NEW DELHI -- A seven-member congressional delegation from the United States, led by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), visited Dharamshala, the seat of the Tibetan government in exile, on June 18.\n\nOn the same day, Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited the Tibetan Buddhist community in Qinghai, a province traditionally called Amdo by Tibetans. A Tibetan expert called the timing and manner of both visits highly symbolic.\n\nThe Himalayan town of Dharamshala has served as the seat of the Tibetan government in exile since 1960.\n\nThe U.S. delegation met with Tibet's spiritual leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, on Wednesday, and later addressed a gathering of Tibetan exiles, including children from Tibetan schools. Meanwhile, Xi visited the ancient Hongjue Temple in Tibet's northwestern province of Qinghai, according to a report from Chinese state media Xinhua.\n\nAfter her meeting, Ms. Pelosi posted pictures of the bipartisan delegation with the Dalai Lama and Penpa Tsering, president of the Central Tibetan Administration, the Tibetan government in exile. Her post on X said she \"strongly reaffirmed Congressional support for the people of Tibet.\"\n\nAt a public meeting organized by the Central Tibetan Administration, Mr. McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was \"determined to end the Tibetan culture\" after it \"forcibly brought\" the Tibetan people under its control.\n\nAfter the brutal Chinese occupation of Tibet and a failed Tibetan uprising in 1959, the young Dalai Lama fled to India. The spiritual leader was followed by more than 80,000 Tibetans.\n\n\"Decades later, the Chinese Communist Party continues to threaten the freedom of Tibetan people and they have even attempted to insert themselves into the succession of the Dalai Lama. We'll not let that happen,\" Mr. McCaul said.\n\nMs. Pelosi spoke to the gathering about the \"Resolve Tibet Act,\" which was passed by the U.S. Congress last week. She said the bill sends a message to the Chinese regime that the United States has clarity on the issue and understands the value of Tibet's freedom.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is soon expected to sign the bill, which seeks to encourage the Chinese regime to talk to the Tibetan leaders -- a process that has been stalled since 2010.\n\nThe former house speaker said the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader's legacy \"will live forever.\"\n\nThe delegation also met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his national security advisor, Ajit Doval, on Thursday. However, Mr. Modi's office didn't comment on the U.S. delegation's visit to Dharamshala.\n\n\"Why did the U.S. delegation visit Dharamasala only a few days before the Dalai Lama leaves for the U.S. for knee surgery? They could have met in the U.S. This point has not been answered. It is probably to involve India in the larger U.S.-China confrontation,\" Mr. Arpi said.\n\nThe timing of the visit was also linked to the Resolve Tibet Act, he said.\n\n\"The Act states that Tibet was an independent State. It is important for India which since the 1950s, shares a long and tense border confrontation with China,\" particularly after the bloody Galwan conflict in May 2020, he said. For thousands of years, India's northern boundary has been an Indo-Tibet border, he said.\n\nThe eastern sector of today's India-China border, known as the McMahon Line, was agreed upon by British India and independent Tibet in March 1914, during a conference in Shimla, the summer capital of British India.\n\nThe visit's goal was to \"promote the fine tradition of patriotism and love for religion in the Tibetan Buddhist community and promote national unity and progress,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nMr. Arpi, however, cited pictures released by the state news agency, in which Xi is visible along with Tibetan monks in Hongjue Temple. The 7th century monastery is linked with \"a previous Panchen Lama,\" he said, giving it special significance.\n\nMr. Arpi stressed the symbolic meaning of the yellow umbrella presented to Xi, and the incense burned before the Chinese dictator during his visit to the temple.\n\nThe yellow umbrella is one of the \"eight religious signs\" of Tibetan Buddhism and is offered only to a Dalai Lama \"or very high lamas,\" Mr. Arpi said.\n\nAt a regularly scheduled press conference on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian asked the U.S. delegation to have no contact with the \"Dalai group\" and \"stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\n\"On the relevant act in the U.S. Congress, let me stress that Xizang [Tibet] has always been part of China since ancient times. Xizang's affairs are purely China's domestic affairs and no external interference will ever be allowed,\" said Mr. Lin. The foreign ministry spokesman said that Tibetan society in China enjoys \"social stability and harmony.\"\n\nMr. Lin urged the United States not to pass the Resolve Tibet Act.\n\n\"We urge the U.S. side to adhere to its commitments of recognizing Xizang as part of China and not supporting 'Xizang independence,'\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Central Tibetan Administration told The Epoch Times that while the U.S. delegation's visit to Dharamshala was extremely significant, particularly in light of the Resolve Tibet Act, the scenario shouldn't be viewed only from the perspective of competitive geopolitics between the United States and China.\n\nRather, \"this visit gives a timely space for China to rethink and change [its] repressive policies concerning the violation of Tibetan rights and freedom,\" Central Tibetan Administration spokesman Tenzin Llekshay said in a written response.\n\nThe visit is also a chance to change the world for the better \"by calling the Chinese leaders to restart the dialogue to resolve the longstanding Sino-Tibetan Conflict,\" he stated.\n\nThe Tibetan spokesman called for positive thinking from the Chinese regime and said that the Central Tibetan Administration is calling for a mutually beneficial solution.\n\n\"Since the Central Tibetan Administration is consistently following the Middle Way Policy for the genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people, which is a mutually beneficial solution, China must attempt to think positively and act upon starting the dialogue not just for the sake of Tibetan people but for their own interest and the world,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But you, the president of China, you'll be gone and nobody will give you credit for anything,\" Ms Pelosi said.\n\nIn August 2022, Ms Pelosi's visit to Taiwan prompted Beijing to stage aggressive military exercises around the self-governing island and to suspend co-operation with Washington for months.\n\nThe Democratic politician acknowledged on Wednesday that her remarks would offend the Chinese authorities, who view the Dalai Lama as a Tibetan separatist.\n\n\"Dalai Lama would not approve of my saying that when I criticise the Chinese government. He says, 'let's pray for Nancy to rid her of her negative attitudes',\" Ms Pelosi said. \"I hope he will indulge me today to say that change is on the way. As our colleagues have said, hope brings some faith and the faith of the Tibetan people in the goodness of others is what is going to make all the difference.\"\n\nChina occupied Tibet, which it refers to as Xizang, in the 1950s after hundreds of years during which its territory changed hands between Chinese and local warlords.\n\nIt claims that Tibet has always been part of China and that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) freed the Tibetan people from feudalism. The Chinese authorities reject claims that its policies are suppressing Tibetan language, culture and religious identity.\n\n[ EU diplomats visit schools, religious sites and prison in Tibet in dialogue with China on human rights ]\n\nBeijing this week condemned the US delegation's visit to Dharamshala where the Dalai Lama, who has been in exile from Tibet since 1959, lives in a monastery.\n\n\"The 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Chinese ministry for foreign affairs spokesman Lin Jian said.\n\n\"We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honour the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang, have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nMs Pelosi's visit follows the passage of a Bill in the House of Representatives that would direct funds to counter what it calls disinformation from Beijing about Tibet's history and people. The Bill, which US president Joe Biden has yet to sign into law, encourages US officials to press Beijing to negotiate with the Dalai Lama or his representatives about Tibet's future.\n\nA group of senior diplomats from the European External Action Service visited Tibet last week as part of the EU-China human rights dialogue. The Chinese authorities allowed them to visit the specific schools, religious sites and a prison they requested but the ministry for foreign affairs in Beijing condemned what it called the EU's interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.\n\n\"In response to the EU's groundless accusations against China's judicial procedure, death penalty, labour rights and issues related to ethnic groups and regions, China laid out the facts that prove otherwise and firmly refuted these allegations,\" ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.\n\n\"The Chinese side pointed to the human rights issues that exist in EU countries, including racial discrimination, infringement on the rights of refugees and immigrants, restriction on freedom of speech, religious hatred, judicial unfairness and violence against women, and asked the EU side to earnestly resolve these issues.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [],

You should be able to freely practice your religion and that is why we are here today in defiance of CCP warning,\" McCaul said. \"Our delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here, they repeated their false claim that Tibet is part of China since the 13th century but we did not let the CCP intimidate us and we are here today,\" he said, adding the Dalai Lama, people of Tibet and United States of America know that Tibet is not a part of China. McCaul said the timing of this visit cannot be better as last week the House of Representatives and the Congress passed Resolve Tibet Bill, which makes it clear that Tibet has its own unique culture, language and religion, and has the right to self-determination.\n\nThis bill, which will be signed in the coming days, also requires to aggressively challenge the CCP propaganda about Tibet, he added.\n\nThe delegation consisting of former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congress members Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera led

Beijing's stance reflects its broader strategy of asserting control over Tibet through economic development initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, while simultaneously tightening political and cultural control over the region.\n\nThe visit by Pelosi and other US lawmakers underscores the continuing tensions over Tibet within the broader context of the US-China strategic competition. Tibet's strategic location, bordering India, Nepal, and other South Asian countries, adds to its significance in regional security dynamics.\n\nThe US stance on Tibet reflects its commitment to human rights and religious freedom globally, contrasting with China's emphasis on sovereignty and territorial integrity. These differences contribute to the complexity of the US-China relations and shape their interactions on a range of international issues.\n\nTibet, historically a Buddhist kingdom with significant cultural and religious autonomy, came under Chinese influence in the 13th century during the Yuan dynasty. However, it maintained a degree of de facto independence until the early 20th century. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army of China invaded Tibet, leading to the signing of the 17-point agreement in 1951, which affirmed China's sovereignty over Tibet while ostensibly guaranteeing Tibetan autonomy under Chinese rule.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, was forced to flee to India in 1959, following an uprising against Chinese rule. Since then, he has founded a government-in-exile from Dharamshala, advocating Tibetan autonomy and cultural preservation. This exile government is not recognised by China or by most other countries, which officially acknowledge Tibet as an autonomous region within the People's Republic of China.\n\nThroughout the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st century, Tibet has remained a contentious issue in international relations, symbolising broader debates on sovereignty, human rights, and religious freedom.\n\nThe United States has consistently expressed concerns over human rights abuses and religious repression in Tibet. It officially recognises Tibet as part of China but supports the middle-way approach proposed by the Dalai Lama, which seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet within China's constitutional framework. This approach aims to protect Tibetan culture, religion, and identity while maintaining China's territorial integrity.\n\nThe US administrations have periodically engaged with the Dalai Lama and Tibetan leaders in exile, despite strong objections from China. These engagements serve as symbolic gestures of support for Tibetan autonomy and human rights, reflecting American values of democracy and freedom.\n\nChina's perspective and policies\n\nChina maintains that Tibet is an inseparable part of its territory, rejecting any notion of Tibetan independence or external interference in its internal affairs.\n\nBeijing argues that its policies in Tibet are aimed at modernisation, economic development, and social stability, dismissing allegations of human rights abuses as Western propaganda.\n\nThe Chinese government has implemented strict controls over religious practices, cultural expression, and political dissent in Tibet. Tibetan Buddhists face restrictions on their religious practices, including limitations on the study and recognition of reincarnated lamas, such as the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has also promoted mass migration of Han Chinese into Tibet, exacerbating concerns about demographic change and cultural assimilation.\n\nChina's response to international criticism and diplomatic engagements involving Tibetan leaders has been assertive and often confrontational. It views such interactions as attempts to undermine its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it pressures other countries and international organisations to reject any form of official recognition or engagement with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth countries factor Tibet into their strategic calculations. The US supports Tibetan autonomy partly to counterbalance China's influence, and advocates democratic values in Asia, while China seeks to consolidate control and prevent any challenges to its territorial integrity.\n\nThe US-China relationship concerning Tibet is multifaceted, encompassing political, human rights, and strategic dimensions. The US' engagement with Tibetan leaders reflects its stance on human rights and religious freedom, while China's response underscores its sensitivity to perceived foreign interference and its assertion of territorial integrity.

You should be able to freely practice your religion and that is why we are here today in defiance of CCP warning,\" McCaul said.\n\n\"Our delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here, they repeated their false claim that Tibet is part of China since the 13th century but we did not let the CCP intimidate us and we are here today,\" he said, adding the Dalai Lama, people of Tibet and United States of America know that Tibet is not a part of China.\n\nMcCaul said the timing of this visit cannot be better as last week the House of Representatives and the Congress passed Resolve Tibet Bill, which makes it clear that Tibet has its own unique culture, language and religion, and has the right to self-determination.\n\nThis bill, which will be signed in the coming days, also requires to aggressively challenge the CCP propaganda about Tibet, he added.\n\nThe delegation consisting of former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congress members Mariannette Miller, Gregory Meeks, Nicole Malliotakis, Jim McGovern and Ami Bera led by McCaul, called on the Dalai Lama ahead of the function and held discussions.\n\n\"I presented the Dalai Lama with a windshine, which will remind him of our support,\" McCaul said.\n\n\"Like many of you, I wish that this meeting was happening in your home land of Tibet, but 65 years ago you were forced to flee after the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) annexed Tibet and slaughtered tens of thousands of Tibetans people,\" he added.\n\nMcCaul said the CCP was determined to end the Tibetan culture and forcibly bring the Tibetan people under their control.\n\nTo save his people and culture, his holiness led more than 80,000 of his followers to safety to preserve their way of life for the future generations, McCaul said.\n\nThanks to the kindness of the Indian people, his holiness and his people were able to live freely here and practice their religion without fear of prosecution, he added.\n\n\"It is still my hope that one day his holiness the Dalai Lama and his people will return back to Tibet in peace,\" McCaul said.\n\nHe added that decades later the CCP continues to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people and they have even tried to insert them into the succession of the Dalai Lama but we will not let that happen.\n\n\"It reminds us that even if the CCP takes your land, they cannot take away your culture and spirit and what the Tibetan people mean to the rest of the world, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dalai Lama while talking to the US delegation at his residence here said our goal is that people of the world should be happy and peaceful.\n\n\"We are the same human being, we all have the same right and this world belongs to humanity. We should take care of the world irrespective of what religion and tradition,\" he said.

Tibetans are a democracy-loving people who wish to practice their religion freely. This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" McCaul added.\n\nChina, which claims Tibet as it territory, has reacted sharply to this development.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion. We are gravely concerned over the relevant reports and urge the US side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the US has made to China on issues related to Xizang (Chinese official name for Tibet), have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday (19 June).", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kuldeep_negi@swarajyamag.com", "name": "Kuldeep Negi", "type":

Recently endorsed by the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, this legislation reflects a notable shift in Washington's approach under President Joe Biden, signalling a more assertive stance against Beijing.\n\nBroadening Tibet's Definition\n\nThe bill not only strengthens existing laws supporting Tibet but also redefines its geographical scope. Beyond China's designated Tibet Autonomous Region, it includes historically Tibetan areas like Kham and Amdo, areas fiercely contested by China. This bold expansion bolsters the Dalai Lama's authority in choosing his successor and mandates decisive US action against Chinese interference, effectively rejecting China's long-held 'One China Policy' and its authoritative grip over Tibet.\n\nRead | Nancy Pelosi's stern message to Xi: 'Dalai Lama will live forever but President of China, you'll be gone'\n\nCountering Chinese Propaganda: Defending Tibetan Autonomy\n\nCentral to the legislation is a robust effort to counter Chinese propaganda on Tibet's history and culture. The bill aims to safeguard Tibetan autonomy and challenge China's regional dominance, setting the stage for potential international friction over Tibet's sovereignty and the succession of the Dalai Lama. Anticipated to pass into a law imminently, this move represents a significant diplomatic escalation between the US and China.\n\nAsserting Tibet's Unresolved Status\n\nThe bill unequivocally rejects China's historical claims that Tibet has always been an integral part of its territory. By asserting Tibet's unresolved status, the US challenges China's narrative and extends its support beyond the Tibet Autonomous Region to encompass Tibetan areas in Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces.\n\nPromoting Dialogue and Human Rights\n\nThe legislation directs substantial efforts by the US to counter Chinese misinformation regarding Tibet's history, culture, and people. It mandates proactive support from the US State Department for dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without imposing preconditions. This marks a pivotal shift towards emphasising human rights and self-determination for Tibetans amid ongoing global tensions with China.\n\nBipartisan Support and Global Impact\n\nThe bill's passage underscores a rare bipartisan consensus in the US Congress to stand in solidarity with Tibetans striving for freedom and autonomy. This unified stance challenges Beijing's assertiveness and aims to draw global attention to the plight of Tibetans under Chinese rule, highlighting their ongoing struggle for cultural preservation and self-determination.\n\nHistorical Context: Tibet's Struggle Under Chinese Rule\n\nSince China's military invasion of Tibet in 1950, the region has endured sustained resistance against Chinese dominance. The signing of the controversial Seventeen Point Agreement in 1951 consolidated China's control, triggering widespread Tibetan resistance and culminating in a major uprising in 1959. This upheaval led to the Dalai Lama's exile to India, where he established the Central Tibetan Administration in Dharamshala, advocating tirelessly for Tibetan autonomy and cultural preservation.\n\nDo Not Miss | Buddhist monks among 100 held in China's Sichuan province over dam protests\n\nCurrent Dynamics\n\nChina, viewing the Dalai Lama as a separatist threat, vehemently opposes international support for Tibet and continues to exert strict control over Tibetan religious and political affairs. China strongly opposes the US Act aimed at Tibet, urging President Biden not to sign it. \"Anyone attempting to destabilise Xizang to contain or suppress China will fail,\" emphasised Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian in Beijing. He stressed that signing the bill would provoke China to take firm actions to protect its sovereignty, security, and developmental interests. Earlier, China declared it would only engage in talks with the Dalai Lama's representatives, excluding officials from the Tibetan government in exile based in India.\n\nMust Read | Message to China: India to rename 30 places in Tibet after Arunachal provocation\n\nIndia, hosting the Dalai Lama and a sizable Tibetan refugee population, navigates a delicate relationship with China amid ongoing border disputes and geopolitical tensions.\n\nTibet's strategic location as a gateway to South Asia, coupled with its abundant natural resources and cultural significance, positions it at the centre of regional geopolitics. China's extensive infrastructure development in Tibet, including ambitious railway and highway projects, underscores its economic and strategic ambitions in the region, amplifying its influence on global competition.\n\nThe future of Tibet remains uncertain amid ongoing international scrutiny and diplomatic manoeuvres. The succession of the Dalai Lama, a pivotal spiritual and political figure, holds profound implications for regional stability and the broader relations between China, India, and the international community. As the US and Indian support for Tibet endures, tensions with China persist, underscoring Tibet's enduring significance in global affairs.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news",

They met the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala on Wednesday.\n\nThe delegation's visit highlighted the ongoing international interest and support for the cause of Tibetan autonomy and the human rights situation in the region.\n\nThe historical narrative of the Dalai Lama's escape, depicted in Khymsar's film, is not just a tale of the past, but a poignant reminder of the enduring struggle for freedom and justice of the Tibetan people.\n\nThat the struggle does not seem to have an easy resolution is evident from China's warning that it would take \"resolute measures\" if President Joe Biden signs the bipartisan Resolve Tibet Act passed by the US Congress. The Act seeks to enhance US support for Tibet and promote a dialogue between the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama for a peaceful resolution of the long-standing dispute between the two.\n\nKhymsar's film, according to a press note, draws from his deep personal commitment to Tibetan culture and his experiences while growing up in exile. With 'Four Rivers Six Ranges', Khymsar aims to bring the untold stories of ordinary Tibetans on to the global stage.\n\nIncidentally, Shenpenn Khymsar's co-producer is Dorjee Wangdi Dewatshang, whose father, Kunga Samten, was one of the warriors of Chushi Gangdruk (Four Rivers Six Ranges).", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_and_uprisings_in_Tibet_since_1950", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protests and uprisings in Tibet since 1950"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McCaul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael McCaul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Foreign_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "People's Liberation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chushi_Gangdruk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chushi Gangdruk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan Medicine", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/202406193177280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Since China's takeover of Tibet in the 1950s, the Buddhist leader has lived in exile there. The head of the American delegation said that President Biden will soon sign a law urging China to resolve the Tibet dispute.\n\nDiscussion on the Dalai Lama's successor: The Dalai Lama celebrates his 89th birthday on July 6. But the debate over his successor began long ago. \"At the political level, he gave up his power in 2011,\" explains Leah Berger, SRF's religion editor. Since then there has been an elected parliament. \"However, the Dalai Lama remains an important figure on the political scene. This visit by the American delegation of high-level representatives shows that.\" Regarding his reincarnation and spiritual succession, the Dalai Lama once said that he would like to comment on his successor when he turns 90, That is, after a year.\n\nHere the Dalai Lama struck a new tone.\n\nWho can succeed the Dalai Lama? In the past, the Buddhist leader has briefly mentioned various options for his successor. \"For example, he said that even a woman could inherit it,\" Berger says. Another option is popular vote. \"Both proposals are unusual and inconsistent with previous traditions.\" They are usually men and the selection process is complicated. \"Here the Dalai Lama struck a new tone.\"\n\nChina's role in the caliphate: China occupied Tibet in 1950, and has considered it its territory ever since. This is why China wants to organize the successor to the Dalai Lama himself. \"In this Sino-Tibetan interaction, the so-called golden jar has actually been used before.\" A kind of lottery to determine the next reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. China now claims this is a way to prevent fraudulent elections. \"In fact, it's quite the opposite: China is trying to influence the election,\" Berger says. This influence of China on other important figures was also observed in the election of the Panchen Lama. \"China has identified the official successor itself.\"\n\nThe role of the Panchen Lama: In 1995, the 11th Panchen Lama was kidnapped, and to this day there is no trace of him. After the kidnapping, China appointed its successor, the new Panchen Lama, who has a positive attitude towards China. \"When it comes to finding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama plays an important role,\" explains the expert. This confirms this reincarnation, as well as the opposite. Traditionally, the two also give religious instructions to each other and have a teacher-student relationship. \"The whole thing shows that in order to have influence in Tibet, the Panchen Lama is a very central figure,\" Berger says.", "source": {"uri": "thewestonforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aspetuck News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "esmond_barker@thewestonforum.com", "name": "Esmond Barker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reincarnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchen_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panchen Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caliphate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_Panchen_Lama_controversy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "11th Panchen Lama controversy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sino-Tibetan languages"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Buddhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Buddhism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical_Intermediates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical Intermediates", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan Medicine", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Reincarnation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Reincarnation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.srf.ch/static/cms/images/branded_srf_news/1e44d6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 498, "textEnd": 504}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

China criticism", "body": "Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the US House of Representatives waves to the crowd upon her arrival at the Kangra airport in India on Tuesday\n\nA group of senior US lawmakers including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi met Wednesday with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, sparking heavy criticism from China.\n\nThe bipartisan group of US lawmakers, led by Congressman Michael McCaul and Pelosi, visited the 88-year-old Buddhist spiritual leader at his home base in the northern Indian hill-town of Dharamsala.\n\nPelosi told crowds of Tibetans it was an \"honour\" to have met with the Dali Lama, in a speech carried by the government-in-exile's Tibet TV.\n\n\"It is truly a blessing\", Pelosi said.\n\nThe visit follows the passage of a bill by the US Congress that seeks to encourage Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders -- frozen since 2010.\n\n\"This bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have clarity in our thinking and understanding in the issue of the freedom of Tibet\", she said.\n\nPelosi said the bill was \"soon to be signed\" by US President Joe Biden.\n\nAhead of the visit, China's embassy in New Delhi criticised the meeting, saying the Dalai Lama was \"not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\".\n\nMany exiled Tibetans fear Beijing will name a rival successor to the Dalai Lama, bolstering control over a land it poured troops into in 1950.\n\nThe Dalai Lama was just 23 when he escaped the Tibetan capital Lhasa in fear for his life after Chinese soldiers eviscerated an uprising against Beijing's forces, crossing the snowy Himalayas into India.\n\nHe stepped down as his people's political head in 2011, passing the baton of secular power to a government chosen democratically by some 130,000 Tibetans around the world.\n\n\"The democracy of the diaspora of the Tibetans in exile is very important to us,\" Pelosi said.\n\nPenpa Tsering, the sikyong or head of that government, said it does not seek full independence for Tibet, but rather to pursue a long-standing \"Middle Way\" policy seeking greater autonomy and \"to resolve the Sino-Tibet conflict through dialogue\".\n\nBut Beijing's embassy accused the Tibetan administration of seeking to break away.\n\n\"We urge the US side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group,\" the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in India wrote on social media late Tuesday.\n\nIt reiterated its oft-repeated position that the high-altitude territory \"has always been part of China since ancient times\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

urged Washington to not support Tibetan independence and said the White House \"must not sign the bill into law,\" or Beijing will take \"resolute measures,\" without elaborating on what these measures may be.\n\n\"It's known by all that the 14th Dalai Lama is not a pure religious figure, but a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,\" Lin added on Tuesday, urging the U.S. side to \"have no contact with the Dalai group in any form, and stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.\n\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader has a history of engaging with U.S. officials, he has met with all recent American presidents -- from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama -- except for Donald Trump and he is yet to meet Biden.\n\nBeijing, meanwhile, has repeatedly asked the U.S. not to interfere with Tibetan affairs and has argued that the people of Tibet have enjoyed social stability and economic growth under its rule.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is expected to travel to the U.S. on Thursday for medical treatment on his knees, but it is unclear if he will meet any officials while there.\n\nAP writers Krutika Pathi in New Delhi and Didi Tang in Washington contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri":

His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama has already declared that. In response, the Chinese government launched a major campaign to counter that position. But it is clear that Beijing does not have any role to play in the reincarnation of the next Dalai Lama,\" said Dr. Sangay making an elaborate presentation on the idea of reincarnation and why it could have a major geopolitical implication.\n\nDr. Sangay pointed out that there are many Buddhist dominated countries in Asia and beyond and all these countries could end up being affected if the Chinese interfere with the process of finding a successor to the present Dalai Lama Dalai Lama who will soon be marking his 89th birthday on July 6. The present Dalai Lama who resides mostly in McLeodganj met with the U.S. lawmakers led by the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Michael McCaul and ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The process of reincarnation came into sharp focus on Wednesday when Mr. McCaul in his remarks before the Tibetan community in Dharamshala declared that China is trying to interfere into the \"succession\" of the present Dalai Lama. In response to the arrival of the U.S. lawmakers in India, Beijing had said that it would take \"resolute measures\" to defend its sovereignty.\n\nResponding to the Chinese remarks, Dhundup Gyalpo Bawa, Secretary of Bureau of the Dalai Lama supported the remarks made by the visiting U.S. lawmakers and said that the Beijing's position that Tibet has been part of China since \"ancient times\" is \"inaccurate\".\n\nChina has in the recent past insisted that the successor to the present Dalai Lama will require to have its approval and that the successor will have to be found \"within the country\". However, in his response to the Chinese position, Dr. Sangay cited from history and showed that the fourth Dalai Lama Yonten Gyatso was born in 1589 in Mongolia and that the sixth Dalai Lama was born in Tawang in 1683 indicating that there are historical precedents that the Dalai Lama was reincarnated on occasions outside of China.\n\nReincarnation and realpolitik keeps Dalai Lama's succession in dilemma\n\nDr. Sangay also endorsed the comments made by the visiting U.S. lawmakers who met with External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday and appreciated ex-House Speaker Pelosi's comments on President Xi Jinping as \"very strong comments\". He urged the Indian parliament to move a motion in support of maintaining the sanctity and integrity of the process of selecting the next Dalai Lama.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobsang_Sangay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lobsang Sangay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reincarnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikyong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikyong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Tibetan_Administration", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Tibetan Administration"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "14th Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod_Ganj", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLeod Ganj"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McLeod Ganj"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Foreign_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

Let's explore more about it.\n\nThe word \"Dalai\" is a Mongolian word meaning ocean or big and signifies vastness. \"Lama\", on the other hand, is a Tibetan term meaning guru or spiritual teacher.\n\nThe term Dalai Lama translates roughly to \"Ocean of Wisdom\" or \"Oceanic Teacher,\" indicating a teacher whose wisdom is as deep and vast as the ocean.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is considered the spiritual leader of the Gelug or \"Yellow Hat\" school of Tibetan Buddhism, the newest and most dominant of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThe title was first bestowed upon Sonam Gyatso by Altan Khan of the T\u00fcmed Mongols in 1578. Sonam Gyatso became the third Dalai Lama, but he was the first to hold the title during his lifetime. The two predecessors were posthumously recognised as the first and second Dalai Lamas.\n\nThe Dalai Lamas are believed to be the manifestations of Avalokiteshvara (Chenrezig in Tibetan), the Bodhisattva of Compassion and the patron saint of Tibet. According to Tibetan Buddhist belief, each Dalai Lama is a reincarnation of his predecessors.\n\nThe Dalai Lama serves as both the spiritual and temporal leader of the Tibetan people. The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has retired from political responsibilities and advocated for a democratic government for Tibetans in exile.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's role is significant in maintaining the cultural and religious heritage of Tibetan Buddhism and advocating for the rights and freedom of the Tibetan people.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [{"uri": "riya_teotia@wionews.com", "name": "Riya Teotia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mongolian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "3rd Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tumed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altan_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Altan Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalokite\u015bvara", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avalokite\u015bvara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bodhisattva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "14th Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reincarnation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Buddhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Buddhism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan Medicine", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Reincarnation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Reincarnation", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://images1.wionews.com/images/wion/400x300/2024/6/19/1718780179311_DGkkfCVUAABd3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

China, accustomed to irritating the world with its fanciful territorial claims and its actions on the LAC with India and its aggressive posturing on Taiwan and the Pacific Ocean, is now getting a bit of a taste of its own medicine.\n\nA bipartisan Congressional delegation of seven prominent US lawmakers visited Dharmshala in Himachal Pradesh to engage with the Dalai Lama and to assure him of American support for full autonomy for Tibet.\n\nThe presence of former Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, who once needled China by visiting Taiwan in 2022 when she was in office, and the Republican House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul was meant to be a signal to China that its views on territory are not always taken as the last word and its sensitivities are not going to silence the world forever.\n\nThe US President is also to soon sign the Resolve Tibet Act after the bill, moved last month in the US House by Mr McCaul who also led the delegation to Dharamshala, received overwhelming bipartisan support. \"The US strongly condemns all oppression and coercion of Tibetans,\" is what Mr McCaul said while piloting the bill.\n\nWhether the signing of the bill into law succeeds in its aim to put the people of Tibet in charge of their own future by starting a dialogue with China on the status of their land or not, it is certain to rile China more as it challenges the view it has propagated for so long that Tibet has been part of China since ancient times.\n\nIndia is not just a spectator to the US meeting with the Dalai Lama as it facilitated this interaction in a strategic ploy while showing the ability to stand up to China. How this will add to the tensions as the troops of both nations face each other from quarters too close for comfort is not known.\n\nThe message is clear that India will not take it lying down as China continues to play games in renaming places in India such as Arunachal Pradesh and objecting to visits there by the Prime Minister.\n\nTo tacitly support the concept of an autonomous Tibet is a counter card that India is obviously playing here even as the US rakes up the issue of Chinese moves that led to the Dalai Lama and a whole host of Tibetans seeking refuge in India since 1959.\n\nThe meeting of US lawmakers with the Dalai Lama on Indian soil will not change India's declared position of recognising Tibet as a part of China after having treated it as a de facto independent country.\n\nWhat India's stand here tries to convey is that it would like Beijing to resolve tensions with Tibet and help protect the region's native Buddhist culture, which had drawn a lot from the Buddhism as practised in India and which had fostered cultural and religious ties with Tibet.\n\nWith the talks to resolve the boundary issues that came up with the Galwan clashes of 2020 going nowhere after initial agreements saw some of India's advantage being nullified, India may have decided to up the ante in the latest round of being the facilitator of the US lawmakers' meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader whom China dubs a separatist.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Sources have said only India has a legitimate say in the Dalai Lama selection and that China was confusing the world and wants to control Tibet.\n\nSources said that being invited to an enthronement much like an oath taking ceremony of current times does not mean giving official legitimacy to the leader in question as the local people and those believing in him have already put him in the role of leadership. \"This would mean those leaders from nations who had come to PM Narendra Modi's oath taking ceremony have given him official legitimacy to govern India for the next 5 years, certainly not,\" sources said.\n\nIndian officials have questioned that when PRC continues to use various derogatory terms like 'wolf in a monks robe' for the Dalai Lama, why are they interested in seeking the control of the reincarnation of a man they so despise?\n\nThe first Dalai Lama was born in 1391 and the People's Republic of China was established in 1949. \"How can they have claim over an institution that precedes their formation,\" sources questioned. The Dalai Lama had formally set up the institution of the Ganden Phorang in 1642 which is before the PRC was formed.\n\nPRC's Founding Father Chairman Mao had infamously said 'Religion is poison' taking it from the Marxist maxim of 'Religion is Opium to the masses' when he met the Dalai Lama in 1956. This is a dictum even followed by the current Communist leadership in China led by President Xi Jinping. Hence, the question is as to why the CCP is so interested in controlling Buddhism in Tibet. The cultural revolution is a standing example and its impact remains large as religions and traditions including Tibetan Buddhism were destroyed and ravaged by the Communist Red Guards.\n\nThe abduction by the CCP of the current 11th Panchen Lama gives a clear indication of how Beijing has and continues to control Buddhism, but has failed.\n\nPeople's Republic of China under the Communist Party of China called for Tibet's invasion in 1949 and it was only in 2007 that they came up with 'Order number 5', which is a set of rules and regulations by Beijing to confirm the reincarnations of high lamas practising the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism. If the process laid out by PRC in the order number 5 is so vital to them, why did the PRC only introduce this order in 2007 and not immediately during the years post occupation?\n\nNo Tibetan law or religion demanded the establishment of the Order number 5. This order was introduced to control and strangle the practice of Buddhism, Indian sources said. Order number 5 is to control Buddhism, not to promote it.\n\nIndian officials have stated that the PRC has no legitimate role in Tibet. While they thought controlling Buddhism was one way, but they have failed miserably as numerous monks and nuns have been fleeing Tibet. Since coming to power, Xi Jinping had made it his mission to sinicize the Tibetan tradition of Buddhism and he has done this by carrying out previous policy mentioned above (Order number 5) and also enforcing Tibetan Buddhist Institutes in Tibet to adopt and adhere to 'Xi Jinping thought of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era'.\n\nThe current monastic education in Tibet stifles proper education and debates. The number of monks/nuns have been restricted, displaying a portrait of His Holiness in a monastery or even possessing one is a punishable offense. A source said, \"Namkyi, who escaped exile recently, highlighted to us all how by her carrying a picture of the Dalai Lama and calling for his return branded her as a political prisoner and she was sentenced.\"\n\nRecent incidents like the Larung Gar demolition, destruction of Buddhist Statue in Drago County, all indicate how the current communist leadership from Beijing views Buddhism and the Dalai Lama. Yet, still they claim to have legitimacy over the Dalai Lama which is \"confounding\".\n\nIndia has a more legitimate say when it comes to the Dalai Lama as Buddhism originated and spread from India to the rest of the world. The Buddhism that the Dalai Lama teaches and other practices are by and large from the Nalanda tradition of Buddhism.\n\nA statement by the Ministry of External Affairs must be made stating that India will support and endorse the 15th Dalai Lama in accordance with the processes set forth by the current 14th Dalai Lama and that it would strongly oppose outside interference and influence in matters related to his succession as it is a purely religious matter and it is for the Tibetans to decide for themselves; and should the 15th Dalai Lama wish to be in India, then he too shall be an honoured guest just like the 14th Dalai Lama and the Government of India shall provide all the support as offered to the current Dalai Lama to the 15th Dalai Lama. India should be seen as the main unifying force in safeguarding the sanctity of the succession process which will remove doubts and anxiety from the minds of Tibetans. In this context, the Government of India must publicly endorse the statement of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, on the issue of his reincarnation made on September 24, 2011.", "source": {"uri":

It was August 2, 2022, and despite the stiff resistance from China, and a token opposition from President Joe Biden, Pelosi went ahead with her visit to Taiwan, a country China claims is its territory. Beijing's retaliation was quick and unequivocal -- several military exercises that may have given both the Taiwanese and Biden more than a few moments of anxiety.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pelosi accompanied a high-level delegation of US Representatives to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamshala (Himachal Pradesh), and we all know how much the Chinese love the saint from Tibet. Beijing had condemned the visit in advance. Pelosi's visit comes days after the US Congress passed a bill that urged China to start a dialogue with Tibetan leaders to find a solution for the longstanding conflict.\n\nWell, for starters, China thinks of Tibet as part of its sovereign territory, even if it has autonomous status. The Chinese even have a local name for it -- Xizang. The Chinese annexed this region in the early 1950s and by 1959, after the failure of the armed uprising of 1959, the Dalai Lama had to flee Tibet and take refuge in India. In 1965, the Tibet Autonomous Region became a provincial-level division of China.\n\nThe difference between Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and the current Congressional delegation is that the Taiwan mission was a Democrat-only delegation, while the Dalai Lama one is bipartisan. It is led, in fact, by Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in New Delhi issued a stern statement. \"We urge the US side to fully recognise the anti-China separatist nature of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the U.S. has made to China on issues related to Xizang, stop sending the wrong signal to the world.\"\n\nThe Americans, too, did not pull any punches. Rep McCaul said at a public function on Wednesday after the meeting with the Dalai Lama, that the Chinese had sent the delegation a letter \"warning us not to come here\". He said the US stood with Tibet in what he called \"its right to self-determination.\" For good measure, he added, \"America, the beautiful, will support Tibet to remain a powerful force as always.\"\n\nPelosi said, \"They (the Chinese) are trying to erase the (Tibetan) culture by reducing the use of the language. They are trying something that we cannot let them get away with. I'll be gracious to the Chinese people, I don't know that they're up to this, but we do know that the Chinese government is, and we do know that they must get the message. This legislation sends the message, the House and the Senate and soon to be signed by Joe Biden, the president of the United States.\"\n\nThis visit is not a political coincidence, and the optics are far too obvious to miss. The American national security advisor Jake Sullivan is in New Delhi this week holding talks on expanding defence and technology cooperation. In his third term as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi will want to instill a sense of continuity in New Delhi's engagement with Washington on key issues, including critical and emerging technologies, partnerships in climate mitigation measures, immigration, and bioengineering. His state visit to the US in 2023 was an important step in this regard.\n\nThe US wants India as a critical counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific, and in this endeavour, it is willing to even sidestep -- to the extent it can -- seemingly egregious acts such as the alleged attempt on the life of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American citizen who is a designated Khalistani terrorist in India.\n\nAmerica also needs India for a more strategic reason -- Russia is getting far too close to China. In May this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin met Chinese President Xi Jinping for a record 43rd time (even if two heads of states are best of friends, they rarely meet even twice a year). This week, Putin met North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. These are not mere exchange of pleasantries. There is a strong anti-western convergence taking place, and Beijing and Moscow are at the centre of it all. North Korea is important to both to counter two important American allies in East Asia -- South Korea and Japan.\n\nPutin is effectively in charge of Russia for nearly 25 years. When he took over in Moscow, things were a little different. In 2000, a fast-rising China was, in fact, celebrating its proximity to both the US and Europe. Xi's elevation as President changed everything. He has effectively doubled down as Russia as his prime partner in his quest to make China the primary mover and shaker of the world order.\n\nThe two-year-old trade war between Washington and Beijing has not helped matters. Simultaneously, just before the start of his invasion of Ukraine, Putin travelled to Beijing and proclaimed an \"alliance without limits\" with China.\n\nBoth Putin and Xi have one ambition -- to end what they called American hegemony and bring the US to its knees. The US, of course, will have none of it, and as its domestic legislations in the last 20 months have shown, Biden is more than willing to take on Xi.\n\nHere's the thing, though. America needs strong regional partnerships. No one better than India. Biden was in New Delhi last year for the G20, and the two countries are part of the Quad (with Australia and Japan). The strongest bond, however, is the people-to-people ties. The Indian American community accounts for more than four million of America's population, and is, by far, the most prosperous of all ethnic communities.\n\nThe US Congressional visit to Dharamshala with Pelosi, therefore, is not just a handshake between two groups of leaders, it is a hard message to Beijing to remind it that America is not done yet, no matter what the viral videos say about Biden's cognitive decline.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet",

Yet the anti-China US politicians still went ahead with the visit, trying to use Xizang as a pretext to disrupt social stability and hinder the country's development.\n\nIt should be noted that the visit came shortly after the US Congress passed legislation last week called \"Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act\", which China hawks in Washington claim seeks to encourage Beijing to speak with the Dalai Lama clique and reach a negotiated agreement. US President Joe Biden is expected to sign it into law soon.\n\nThe rising frequency with which the anti-China forces have sought to play the \"Xizang card\" in a renewed smear game against Beijing reflects how desperate they have become to use whatever remaining value the Dalai Lama clique has to create trouble for China. The clique, representing the feudal serfdom ruling class of old Xizang, is fast fading into history.\n\nThat US lawmakers have passed a bill dictating what the government of another sovereign country should do in terms of its internal affairs is absurd enough. That it is based on lies, such as Beijing has refused to talk with the Dalai Lama, makes it even more preposterous. The central government received 13 visits by private representatives of the Dalai Lama between 1979 and 2002, and it is his consistent denials that Tibet is an integral part of China, and refusal to stop his attempts to separate it from the country that has shut the door on negotiation.\n\nThe US has played a despicable role in the Dalai Lama clique's separatist activities. In the mid-1950s, the Central Intelligence Agency helped to train Tibetan separatists to carry out subversive activities in Xizang. During the armed rebellion in Xizang in 1959, the CIA helped the Dalai Lama to flee, and supported rebel forces with weapons and ammunition.", "source": {"uri": "macaudailytimes.com.mo", "dataType":

Formal talks between China and the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, and his representatives have stalled since 2010.\n\n\"With regard to contact and negotiations between the central government of China and the 14th Dalai Lama, our policy has been consistent and clear,\" said Lin Jian, a spokesman at China's foreign ministry. \"The key is that the 14th Dalai Lama must fundamentally reflect on and thoroughly correct his political views,\" Lin said at a regular ministry news conference.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "14th Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State Council of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan people"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan Medicine", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/21_05_2024_14_41_42_7337377.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

He emphasized continued U.S. support for the Tibetan people through landmark legislation such as the Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continues to undermine their sovereignty.\n\nThank you Mr. President [Penpa Tsering] and I want to thank the members of the delegation. I also want to thank my beautiful wife Linda for being here as well. Thank you, Linda.\n\nI also want to thank the school children who performed. That was absolutely amazing. Absolutely amazing.\n\nIt demonstrates why we have to keep the Tibetan culture alive and well.\n\nLet me just say, it's an honor to be here today and to lead this bipartisan delegation from the United States Congress to meet His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.\n\nLike many of you, I wish this meeting was happening in your homeland of Tibet, but you were forced to flee 65 years ago after the Chinese Communist Party annexed Tibet and slaughtered tens of thousands of innocent Tibetans.\n\nTo save his people and his culture, His Holiness led more than 80,000 of his followers on a perilous journey -- 4000 kilometers -- through the Himalayas to safety.\n\nThey left behind their homes, their friends, and even some of their family. All with the hope of preserving their way of life for future generations.\n\nThanks to the kindness of the Indian people, His Holiness and his people are able to live freely here and practice their religion without fear of persecution.\n\nBut it is still my hope that one day, the Dalai Lama and his people will return to their home in Tibet in peace.\n\nDecades later, the Chinese Communist Party continues to threaten the freedom of the Tibetan people. And they have even attempted to insert themselves into the succession of the Dalai Lama, but we will not let that happen.\n\nEven after the violence and the forcible removal from his homeland by the CCP, His Holiness continues to preach tolerance and peace and forgiveness.\n\nHe reminds us that even if the CCP takes your land, they cannot take away your culture. They cannot take away your spirit. And they cannot take away what the Tibetan people mean to the rest of the world.\n\nYesterday, I visited the Temple of Democracy here. Chairman Xi says democracy doesn't work. Chairman Xi is wrong, democracy does work.\n\nFor in democracies, people are free. Under tyranny, people are enslaved.\n\nJust this week, our delegation received a letter from the CCP warning us not to come here. They repeated their false claimthat Tibet has been a part of China since the 13th Century. But we did not let the CCP intimidate us, for we are here today.\n\nFor the Dalai Lama knows this is not true that Tibet is part of China. And the people of Tibet know that is not true. And the United States of America knows that is not true.\n\nThe Tibetan people possess a distinct religious, cultural, and historic identity. They should have a say in their own future -- you should. And you should freely practiced their religion.\n\nAnd that is why we are still here today - in defiance of this warning.\n\nThe timing of our visit couldn't be better. We are here just one week after the House of Representatives and the Congress passed the [Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act].\n\nThis bill makes it clear the United States believes Tibet has its own unique language, religion, and culture and has a right to self-determination. The bill also requires the State Department to aggressively challenge CCP propaganda about Tibet.\n\nSo along with my friend, Congressman Jim McGovern, who is also here today and the author of the bill, I am proud to have sponsored this legislation.\n\nAnd I want to thank him for working with me to get this bill -- and Congressman Meeks on the committee -- to get this bill to the president's desk where it will be signed in the coming days.\n\nIn my private meeting with His Holiness, I presented him with wind chimes that play America the Beautiful. I told him that wind cannot be seen, but it is a powerful force that is always present.\n\nMy hope is that this wind chime reminds him that even when our delegation leaves here, that America the Beautiful will support Tibet to remain a powerful force that is always present.\n\nDalai Lama's [are a] manifestation of the Buddha of Compassion.

Until then, Tibet was a peaceful country and Tibetans were living with high value systems and devoted to Buddhist philosophy with ill will for none. Tibet had no army worth its name and when China carried out the aggression and its troops entered Tibet, all that the Tibetans could do was to peacefully protest against the invasion. The merciless Chinese troops massacred the protesting Tibetans in thousands. In such grim situation, the respected spiritual leader the Dalai Lama had no alternative other than leaving Tibet and entering the neighbouring country India with around 85000 Tibetan followers.\n\nDuring this period of stress and strain, Tibet was almost left alone to suffer by the rest of the world. Government of neighbouring country India ought to have protested against Chinese invasion but it did not do so and to add insult to injury, recognised the occupation of Tibet by the Chinese aggressors. At that time, there were many sane voices in India which urged the Government of India to register its protest but the Government of India did not do so.\n\nAll that the Government of India did was to allow the respected the Dalai Lama and his followers to stay in India as refugees. Over the last sixty years, the third generation Tibetans now are mostly living as refugees in India.\n\nAfter occupying Tibet over the last sixty years, China has been systematically plundering the several mineral wealth such as lithium and water resources in Tibet . In a methodical way , Chinese government have been sending native Chinese to settle in Tibet, to destroy the Tibetan culture and traditions. Several monasteries in Tibet have been destroyed.\n\nThe story of injustice to Tibet done by China continues today.\n\nIn the last six decades, China has not concealed its territorial greed and has entered into war with India and have now occupied thousands of kilometres of Indian territory. Obviously, occupation of Tibet by China was the first step in achieving its territorial greed. This practice of claiming the territory of other countries by China continue till today and China seems to be having the last laugh.\n\nIn such circumstances, it is now gratifying that the US House of Representatives have passed the\" Resolve Tibet Act\", that called upon the Chinese government to engage with the respected the Dalai Lama, to ensure that the independence of Tibet would be restored back to Tibetans.\n\nSubsequently, an influential group of US law makers have met the respected the Dalai Lama in Himachal Pradesh in India and exchanged views and offered support to the cause of Tibet. They have further clearly warned Chinese government that they would take steps to safeguard the sovereignty of Tibet in the coming period.\n\nOf course, as expected, Chinese government has protested against the observations of the US lawmakers and said that Tibet is an internal matter for China.\n\nNow, what would be the further developments?\n\nWhile US lawmakers have taken the initiative to support the Tibetan cause, even though after so many decades, it can be said that it is better late than never. The question is whether other countries in the world, particularly western democracies and the discerning thinkers in these regions would voice their support to the initiative taken by the US lawmakers.\n\nThe ball is now clearly in the court of Government of India to seize the initiative and take it forward by extending support to the Tibetan cause. The question is whether the Government of India would do so or fail in its responsibility towards independent Tibet. In this connection, it may be noted that Indian Prime Minister Modi has not met the respected the Dalai Lama even once during the last ten years, when he has been the Prime Minister of India and he remains so now.\n\nIn recent times, China has acted against India's interest in several international forums and obviously, view India as its first enemy.\n\nPossibly, Indian government does not want to antagonise Chinese government to avoid a military confrontation. If this is the attitude of Government of India, it is a defeatist attitude and lacking courage of conviction. Millions of Indians today are sympathetic towards Tibetan cause and want government fo India to speak for Tibet in the world forums.\n\nMany Tibetans have now gone to different countries as refuges and later on becoming citizens of those countries. They all seem to be pre occupied with the business of getting their living and are unable to do anything substantially to help the cause of their motherland.\n\nThe initiative of US lawmakers should get further vigour and India can certainly play a catalytic role in espousing and strengthening the Tibetan cause and stir the world conscience, which has been silent for all practical purposes so far with regard to the plight of Tibetans.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "n_s_venkataraman@eurasiareview.com", "name": "N.

But you, the President of China, you'll be gone, and nobody will give you credit for anything.\"\n\nPelosi's scathing remarks on China are being viewed by some in Indian strategic circles as unnecessary.\n\nGiven that many in India believe that the US should not give such provocative statements against China from Indian territory since tensions between India and China are already sky-high due to the four-year-long standoff between Indian and Chinese troops following deadly clashes in Galwan Valley in June 2020, this could be viewed as a set-up.\n\nThis reluctance to directly criticise China in Indian strategic circles was on display when in 2018, after the 2017 Doklam standoff, Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha wrote to senior political leaders and government circles to avoid India-Tibet events.\n\nFollowing this, the celebration for the 60th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's arrival in India, which was to take place in Delhi, was cancelled and shifted to Dharamshala, and India toned down its engagement with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile.\n\nHowever, this verbal offensive can also be a part of a well thought-out strategy of launching coordinated blows by India and the US.\n\nThere are reports that India is planning to rename 30 locations in Tibet, which is likely to irk China massively. PM Modi's acknowledgment of congratulations from Taiwanese President Lai Ching Te has already received an angry response from China, to which India has taken an indifferent attitude.\n\nAlthough India follows the \"One-China Policy\" where it does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it has not reiterated this policy for well over a decade.\n\nThis is all but a death knell to India's \"One-China policy\" in as few words as possible.\n\nWith the four-year-long standoff at the Line of Actual Control showing no signs of easing and China's rapid build-up of military infrastructure in the disputed areas, India has also stepped up its efforts to match China.\n\nThese diplomatic steps, which look more like a coordinated one-two punch with its construction efforts in border areas, suggest that the heightened diplomatic temperatures with China are set to rise even further.", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"},

I hope our visit served as a symbol of the U.S. government's support for the people of Tibet and the friendship between our two peoples.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "14th Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McCaul", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael McCaul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Foreign_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan Medicine", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The historic temple has been key to Beijing\u2019s communication with the Tibetan Buddhist leader since it affirmed sovereignty over Tibet in 1951.\n\nXi\u2019s inspection was reportedly focused on local efforts to deepen education to forge \u201ca strong sense of community for the Chinese nation\u201d and strengthen the tradition of \u201clove for both the country and the religion\u201d of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as education support from more developed eastern provinces.\n\nHe also met provincial party and government representatives on Wednesday and stressed the province\u2019s \u201cgreat mission\u201d to preserve the ecology, according to Xinhua.\n\nThe province shares the Tibetan Plateau with the Tibet autonomous region and is rich in petroleum, natural gas, and lithium.\n\nThe president sent a signal for ethnic unity as a plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China \u2013 to unveil economic and social development strategies for the coming decade \u2013 is set to convene next month.\n\nHis trip came at the time when tensions are simmering between the US and China over the issue of Tibet.\n\nThe US Congress passed a new Tibet policy bill last week which would channel funds to boost Washington\u2019s support for Tibet and counter what it calls \u201cdisinformation\u201d from China about the region\u2019s history, people and institutions.\n\nA seven-member US congressional delegation met the 14th Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader whom China has described as \u201canti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion\u201d, in India on Wednesday and said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor and would pressure Beijing to resume talks with him.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, who fled China during the Tibetan Uprising in 1959, will turn 89 next month. Beijing has blamed him for bouts of ethnic unrest in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, in the 1980s and again in 2008, upheaval that human rights groups blamed on the government\u2019s repressive religious policies.\n\nThe Dalai Lama was born in Qinghai, where about half those living in the sparsely populated and remote inland province are non-Han Chinese, and most of those are Tibetan.\n\nXi last visited the province three years ago, when he described the northwestern province as \u201ca strategic key place in maintaining stability in Xinjiang and Tibet\u201d.\n\nAlthough Hongjue Temple where Xi visited this time was not the biggest Tibetan Buddhist temple in the city, it was the site of one of the most significant meetings between Communist Party\u2019s leadership and a Tibetan Buddhist leader in 1951, said Xie Maosong, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Strategic Studies at Tsinghua University.\n\nXi Jinping\u2019s father Xi Zhongxun, then the Communist Party\u2019s deputy secretary of the Northwest Bureau and vice-chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, was appointed by Mao Zedong to arrange the 10th Panchen Lama Erdeni Chokyi Gyaltsen\u2019s return to Shigatse in Tibet, according to the Communist Party\u2019s archive.\n\nThe Panchen Lama is considered the most revered religious leader of Tibet after the Dalai Lama.\n\nXi Zhongxun met the 10th Panchen Lama at Hongjue Temple on December 15, 1951, to discuss details of the Panchen Lama\u2019s return trip as part of a treaty signed by Beijing and Tibet in 1950.\n\n\u201cThey spoke for three hours in the temple, discussed a series of important matters, including the further implementation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the specific arrangements for the 10th Panchen Lama\u2019s visit to Tibet,\u201d Xie said.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the most significant meetings that forged the friendship between Xi Zhongxun and the Panchen Lama that lasted for more than four decades.\u201d\n\nA Qinghai official said the temple still kept Xi Zhongxun and the Panchen Lama\u2019s meeting room untouched as a memorial to mark a historic friendship between the party leadership and Tibetan religious leaders.\n\nBesides the senior Xi\u2019s meeting with the Panchen Lama, Hongjue Temple has been a key historical gateway of communication and interaction between China\u2019s central government and Tibetan Buddhist leaders, according to an ethnic and religious affairs researcher from the Chinese Academic of Social Sciences.\n\n\u201cWhen Princess Wencheng travelled to Tibet to marry the then Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo, she made a stop at Xining for a month to get herself ready for the higher altitude in Tibet around 641 AD. The stop later became Hongjue Temple,\u201d the researcher said.\n\nMany Panchen Lamas stayed in the temple after it was built in the Song dynasty.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news",

Both nations maintain a significant number of troops and advanced weaponry along the border. In April, Beijing said that the border dispute was \u201cnot the entirety\u201d of its relations with New Delhi, calling for steady ties.\n\nBut Pant said that New Delhi had made it clear that unless Beijing recognized \u201cIndia\u2019s concerns and sensitivities and respects Indian interests\u201d, it was not moving from that posture.India appears more risk tolerant now when it comes to how far it\u2019s willing to go with pushing the Tibet issueMichael Kugelman, Wilson Centre\n\nIndia, which has long hosted the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, and his followers in their exile in Dharamshala, acknowledged Tibet as part of China in 2003. Following the 2020 border clash, though, New Delhi has ceased accommodating Chinese sensitivities regarding the issue.\n\nMichael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Centre\u2019s South Asia Institute, said that it seemed as though India was \u201ctrying to signal that it can use its relationship with the US as leverage\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt can show China that there are ways that it can push back,\u201d he added.\n\nModi\u2019s hosting of the delegation was a \u201cvery explicit signal\u201d, he said, that New Delhi was \u201cfully\u201d behind the delegation\u2019s audience with the Dalai Lama, and that it wasn\u2019t just \u201cpolitely\u201d facilitating it.\n\n\u201cIndia appears more risk tolerant now when it comes to how far it\u2019s willing to go with pushing the Tibet issue,\u201d Kugelman said.\n\nWhile US-India security relations are deeper than ever before, Kugelman said, the US delegation\u2019s meeting with the Dalai Lama could have consequences along the \u201cline of actual control\u201d (LAC), the disputed 3,000-km (1,864 miles) Himalayan border between China and India, in the form of \u201cstepped-up Chinese provocations\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a real risk and will be something to watch,\u201d he said, suggesting that the growing US-India cooperation could have been one of the triggers of the border clashes in the first place.\n\nRecalling the extensive military exercises China conducted around Taiwan after Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei in 2022, Kugelman said that her latest trip could give Beijing a \u201cpretext to try to push back in a big way against India or the US or their allies\u201d.\n\nJabin Thomas Jacob, a professor of international relations at Shiv Nadar University in India, said that Beijing should remember that New Delhi \u201cdoes not and cannot restrict access\u201d to the Dalai Lama.\n\nUS and other foreign legislators or leaders visiting the Dalai Lama was a \u201clong-standing tradition\u201d, he said, and there was \u201cno reason\u201d for China to send bilateral relations with either India or the US into a \u201ctailspin\u201d.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_M._Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kurt M.

United States is with Tibet and human rights still matter. This is a message not only for Tibet but anybody who is aspiring for human rights and for freedom...all those who are suffering under the intimidation of China and expansionist mentality of Xi Jinping, I think this is a very big message for them. China is annoyed with anything who supports Tibet. We are here not to annoy or humiliate China, Representatives and Senators are here to support the just cause. So, when there is truth, you have a supporter and if there is any truth or when they rectify the wrong politics they are practising in Tibet, they will also get a lot of support.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharamshala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dalai Lama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Tibetan Medicine", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Mental Health", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/06/19/de64dfed27266a08cf647152de25b73c1718784904942326_original.png?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663620", "eventUri": "eng-9663620", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 18, "textEnd": 25}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Xizang's affairs are purely China's domestic affairs and no external interference will ever be allowed. Xizang today enjoys social stability and harmony, with sound economic performance and people's well-being well protected. Xizang keeps making fresh progress in effectively running its society and achieving high-quality development. No one and no force should ever attempt to destabilize Xizang to contain and suppress China. Such attempts will never succeed, said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.\n\nChina urges the US side to adhere to its commitments of recognizing Xizang as part of China and not supporting \"Xizang independence.\" The US must not sign the bill into law.

While they are third-generation settlers now, the future of the Tibetan movement, India's citizenship laws and India not being part of the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees complicate the issue.\n\nHold talks with Dalai Lama, U.S. lawmakers tell China\n\nTo live in India, they must obtain registration certificates (RCs) applicable to other foreigners under the Foreigners Registration Act, 1946 and the Registration of Foreigners Rule. For travelling abroad and entering from Nepal, another set of documents -- Identity Certificate (IC) and Special Entry Permits (SEP) -- are required.\n\nIn 2016, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) changed the norms, making the RC renewal process online and relaxing the period of renewal to five years.\n\nCentre extends \u20b940 crore relief to Dalai Lama's Tibetan Committee upto 2025-26\n\nOfficials and Tibetan activists point out that in the past two decades, there has been a record migration of Tibetans to foreign countries. According to \"The Tibetan Rehabilitation Policy\" formulated by the MHA, the Tibetan population in India stood at 1.10 lakh in 2009.\n\nAccording to MHA's 2022-23 Annual Report, \"per the latest Census 2019 conducted by Central Tibetan Relief Committee (CTRC), the population of Tibetan refugees in India was 73,404.\" The Union government formulated the policy in consultation with The Dalai Lama's CTRC. There was a need to revise the policy in the wake of problems faced by the community.\n\nIn 2015, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government sanctioned a scheme of providing a grant-in-aid of \u20b940 crore to the CTRC for five years. The scheme was extended for another five years.\n\nA major concentration of Tibetan refugees is in Karnataka (21,324), Himachal Pradesh (14,952 ), Arunachal Pradesh (4,780 ), Uttarakhand (4,829), West Bengal (3,076), and Ladakh (6,989), the MHA report said.\n\n\"There is a creeping sense of uncertainty about their future among young Tibetans. Inevitably concerns are about what will happen to them when HHDL is no more as all hopes are centered around him. As a result of migration of Tibetans for a variety of reasons, especially young Tibetans from India, the community has shrunk in numbers. Since the last elections, the Tibetan Parliament (in-exile), could have shown greater sense of unity, and these divisions add to people's concerns\", said Amitabh Mathur, former adviser to the MHA on Tibetan affairs. Despite several initiatives, a few problems remain unrectified. He added that processes governing acquiring a document to travel abroad remain slow.\n\nTibetan Legal Association (TLA) says on its website that since 2013, the ICs could be applied online.\n\n\"In the last few years, the process for obtaining ICs has become far more difficult, with delays of two years increasingly common place and some taking as long as three years to be processed. Such significant delays of between one and three years in being granted ICs, inevitably cause severe difficulties for Tibetans trying to plan international trips for school or other purposes and opportunities,\" TLA said.\n\n\"We are recognised as foreigners living in India. Everything is temporary, we cannot buy properties. We have lost half of our population to foreign countries where they acquire citizenship,\" Tibetan activist and poet Tenzin Tsundue said. \"Indian citizenship comes with a caveat, the government says we will have to give up the benefits and our rights to visit the settlements camps. Many will not be able to visit their parents who live in camps without permits issued by the government agencies,\" he said.\n\nWhile the Citizenship Act, 1955 states that those born in India between January 26, 1950 and on or before July 1, 1987, are citizens by birth, there are few Tibetans who acquired Indian citizenship after moving court. After a series of court judgments, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in 2018 issued comprehensive guidelines to issue passports to Tibetan refugees, subject to police verification.\n\nBetween worlds: 60 years of the Tibetan community in India\n\nMr. Tsundue added that no textbooks teach about the Tibetan movement. \"While we owe gratitude to the government, there is little awareness, that India has recognised Tibet as part of China. There was some buzz about the cause after the 2020 Galwan border clash but that is not enough. (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji has not even met the Dalai Lama,\" the Tibetan activist said.\n\nAn All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet (APIPFT) that was active during the 1970s was reconstituted under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. The APIPFT, mainly comprising Rajya Sabha members that remained inactive since 2011, was revived in December 2014.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

All about the late fighter's bizarre move", "body": "Does Art Jimmerson deserve a pioneer spot in the UFC Hall of Fame?\n\nThe reason for Art Jimmerson, who passed away earlier this week at 61 years old, wearing one boxing glove against Royce Gracie at UFC 1 varies depending on who you ask.\n\nInitially, the general reasoning for Jimmerson's decision was related to his professional boxing career. The Missouri native was riding a 15-fight win streak at the time and didn't want to suffer a significant hand injury, so he wore a glove on his jab hand to attack and nothing on the other to defend.\n\nThe story slightly changes when you ask UFC co-founder Campbell McLaren. According to McLaren, Jimmerson considered wearing both boxing gloves before talking to legendary referee John McCarthy, who informed the boxer of the threat presented by high-level grapplers.\n\nMcLaren claimed Jimmerson quickly became nervous after McCarthy easily took him down. As a result, the professional boxer allegedly wore one glove to ensure the referee could see him tap out so he didn't get his arm broken.\n\nHistory was made on that night, Nov. 12, 1993, as the first UFC event was held inside the McNichols Sports Arena for a spectacle that forever changed the mixed martial arts landscape. The one-night tournament featured fighters from various disciplines, including Gracie (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) and Jimmerson (boxing).\n\nGracie and Jimmerson were matched up in round one for an unforgettable bout. Not only did Gracie showcase the power of jiu-jitsu, but Jimmerson also produced a historic image, as he wore one boxing glove while his other hand was only wrapped.\n\nThe strategy ultimately didn't work out, as Gracie emerged victorious by first-round submission.\n\nDid Art Jimmerson return to the UFC after losing against Royce Gracie?\n\nJohn McCarthy's warning to Art Jimmerson was accurate, as Royce Gracie took him down with ease and quickly won by submission. Jimmerson never fought again in the UFC but did return to professional boxing, retiring with a record of 33-18 after last fighting in 2002.\n\nNonetheless, 'One Glove' will never be forgotten as an MMA pioneer who helped pave the way for the current generation. Regardless of the reasoning, Jimmerson foreshadowed modern-day mixed martial arts featuring a combination of disciplines to develop a world-class fighter.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_foley@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Jake Foley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Jimmerson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Art Jimmerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UFC 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Gracie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royce Gracie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UFC Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_McLaren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campbell McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNichols_Sports_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McNichols Sports Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(referee)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John McCarthy (referee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian jiu-jitsu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submission_(combat_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Submission (combat sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/874f4-17152850780665-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554524", "eventUri": "eng-9554524", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1993-11-12", "textStart": 1067, "textEnd": 1080}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

Jimmerson tapped after Gracie took mount in the fight, in essence losing via position.\n\nAt the time, the UFC's ruleset was bare-bones, and fighters were not actually required to wear gloves to protect their hands. According to UFC co-founder Campbell McLaren, Jimmerson's decision to wear one glove was made so that the ref could see if he tapped.

The cause of death is currently unknown.\n\nJimmerson was a boxer at heart, with a record of 33-18, but his love for 'the sweet science' didn't stop him from pursuing a challenge in a new sport.

The choice was interesting, and it coined his famous nickname, \"One Glove.\"\n\nIn theory, Jimmerson would have been able to jab with the boxing glove and then load up his right hand to deliver a bare-knuckle blow. However, Jimmerson's MMA game plan was foiled by jiu-jitsu legend Royce Gracie within minutes, as the grappler quickly submitted the boxer -- as he did with all of his opponents to win the 'UFC 1' tournament.\n\nJimmerson was one and done when it came to 'Ultimate Fighting', deciding to continue his boxing career as a fighter and later on as a coach, helping others.\n\n\"Art was known for his love of God, family, and boxing,\" his son, Christian, said in a statement on Facebook. \"He will be deeply missed by all who knew him.

Very nice, sweet man, who was very proud to be a part of MMA history. May he rest in peace.\"\n\nIn November 1993, the first UFC event of all time was held in Denver, Colorado. Ten fighters competed in the inaugural event, including Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock, Gerard Gordeau, and Jimmerson. Several significant moments took place that night, but none were arguably more important than the appearance of 'One Glove.'\n\nJimmerson, who was riding a 15-fight win streak in professional boxing at the time, was scheduled to face Royce Gracie. Little did the boxer know that he foreshadowed the future evolution of MMA by wearing one boxing glove while his other hand was simply wrapped to engage in grappling.\n\nArt Jimmerson only fought once in the UFC, a submission loss against Royce Gracie in the inaugural event. With that said, the image of him wearing one boxing glove at UFC 1 will never be forgotten, as he helped pave the way for future MMA fighters.\n\nWhat is Art Jimmerson's professional boxing record?\n\nBefore becoming a professional boxer, Art Jimmerson was a 1983 Golden Gloves winner in the middleweight division.

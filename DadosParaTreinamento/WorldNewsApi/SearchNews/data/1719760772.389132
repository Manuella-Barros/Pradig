In his first official visit to Brunei on Tuesday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr signed a deal with the country\u2019s monarch, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, that committed their two nations to mutually developing their maritime capabilities through joint skills training, as well as research and information sharing. Aside from maritime cooperation, the two leaders forged deals on mutual recognition of education certificates and boosting tourism, as well as renewed memorandums of understanding (MOU) on food security and agricultural cooperation. At the state banquet the sultanate hosted at Istana Nurul Iman, the Brunei leader\u2019s official residence, Marcos Jnr emphasised the importance of continuing to work together on a bilateral basis, as well as other international coalitions, \u201cfor the peace and the stability of the region\u201d. \u201cAnd not only for Asia, but for the Indo-Pacific as well. It is important that those partnerships now be brought back into the modern world. And I look forward for this state visit to once more give an added impetus and warmth and inspiration to the relationship between our two countries,\u201d he said. In response, the sultan, who has ruled Brunei for nearly 60 years, said his government was committed to \u201cfurther strengthen\u201d its ties with the Philippines to \u201cprotect and safeguard our common aspiration\u201d. Before Marcos Jnr left for Brunei, he told the media that he would look for \u201cways for further cooperation with Brunei in ensuring the defence of our countries and of our region\u201d. However, it is not clear if the maritime cooperation deal signed by the two leaders involves any defensive components. The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and China have competing claims in the South China Sea. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague dismissed China\u2019s claims to the South China Sea but Beijing rejected the ruling, insisting it has jurisdiction over all the territory located within the so-called nine-dash line used on its maps. In contrast with Manila\u2019s increasingly confrontational stance towards China\u2019s maritime territorial claims, Brunei\u2019s stance on the South China Sea dispute is notably subdued. It claims a 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone but avoids occupying disputed features or maintaining a military presence. Brunei has stated it prefers peaceful bilateral negotiations, which observers say is influenced by significant economic ties with and investments from China, which limit its opposition to Beijing\u2019s claims. Gill said Brunei, regardless of its silence, was a claimant state in the South China Sea dispute and coordination was crucial if Manila sought to illustrate its intentions of socialising its position with its immediate neighbours in Southeast Asia. \u201cThe MOU will illustrate that, contrary to the region\u2019s misperception that the Philippines only wants to bring in external military powers into the region, Manila wants to deepen intraregional maritime security cooperation with its neighbours to spearhead home-grown solutions,\u201d Gill said. Manila was probably aware that such an MOU with Brunei had its limitations, given the latter\u2019s proximity with Beijing, but it was still important amid the uncertainties in the region, Gill said. \u201cIn this context, socialising pertains to deepening coordination and diplomatic engagements with Brunei to allow it to become more familiar with Manila\u2019s position. Maritime cooperation is an important prerequisite for deeper talks on maritime security issues. So it is a helpful gateway for closer Philippines-Brunei security cooperation,\u201d Gill added. Jennifer Parker, associate at the National Security College at the Australian National University, said while Brunei and the Philippines could seek to work together on naval exercises and training under their new maritime cooperation as they had done in the past, it was unlikely Brunei would be comfortable with any of these activities being considered attempts at countering China. \u201cBrunei and China have significant ties, including a significant amount of Chinese investment in Brunei,\u201d Parker said. China has become Brunei\u2019s largest source of foreign investment and its third-largest trading partner. In October 2022, bilateral trade between Brunei and China reached US$2.53 billion. Asked whether the maritime cooperation would fit into Manila\u2019s larger efforts at building a regional coalition to counter Beijing in the South China Sea, Parker said the deal was not only about China and should also be viewed through the lens of a deepening bilateral relationship, which was important given their proximity and dependence on the same maritime domain. \u201cIt is highly unlikely Brunei would choose to be more assertive against China, given the close economic ties between the two countries,\u201d Parker said. Security analyst Joshua Espe\u00f1a, a resident fellow and vice-president of the International Development and Security Cooperation, said since Brunei was sensitive to a confrontation with China, it could work based on functional cooperation on maritime security through the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East Asean Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) security leg initiatives. BIMP-EAGA is a regional cooperation initiative aimed at enhancing trade, investment, and tourism in less-developed areas of member countries through infrastructure projects and collaborative efforts in various sectors. \u201cBrunei cannot be expected to be proactive given its relatively limited capabilities to confront China. However, it can support regional initiatives that uphold the rules-based order pushed by Manila,\u201d Espe\u00f1a said. \u201cBrunei hosts British forces, who have reasons to support US leadership in the Indo-Pacific. This can indirectly provide signals to support US presence in the region. While Brunei\u2019s legroom is limited, the Philippines can leverage mini-lateral approaches.\u201d", "summary": "The deal involves development of maritime capabilities through joint skills training, as well as research and information sharing.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3264610/philippines-brunei-sign-deal-closer-maritime-cooperation-eye-beijing-south-china-sea", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/29/e2c4be12-8bfa-43c1-84c4-bc09b58bc1d5_6dae32b3.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:00:17", "author": "Jeoffrey Maitem", "authors": ["Jeoffrey Maitem"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.429}

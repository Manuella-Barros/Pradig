Before beating Lorenzo Musetti in Paris on Friday, Djokovic had been 0-3 in Summer Games semifinals, losing to the eventual champion each time -- Rafael Nadal in Beijing, Andy Murray in London, Alexander Zverev in Tokyo. Djokovic left the 2008 Olympics with a bronze, but he really wanted to improve on that now.\n\nHe showed up at the All England Club, wearing a gray sleeve on his right knee, and while it took him a few matches to get going, eventually Djokovic looked very much like himself. Until, that is, he took on Alcaraz for the title.\n\nAt the Summer Games, there was only one match where the knee was an issue -- when he felt pain in the second set of a victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals Thursday night. But he put in plenty of work with his physiotherapist between then and his match against Musetti, when all was OK.\n\n\"I feel like I'm a different player than I was in Wimbledon. The way I move. The way I'm striking the ball,\" said Djokovic, who eliminated Nadal in the second round in Paris.\n\n\"I feel more confident about myself and chances in the final\" on Sunday, he said.\n\n\"The way he's playing,\" Djokovic said, \"he's definitely a favorite.\"\n\nThe only time they played at Court Philippe Chatrier was in the 2023 French Open semifinals.

It was the last major achievement missing from his glittering resume.\n\nHe finally got one at age 37. No matter how long it took, Djokovic defeated Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in a gripping and evenly matched men's tennis final at the 2024 Games on Sunday.\n\n\"I put my heart, my soul, my body, my family, everything on the line to win Olympic gold,\" Djokovic said. \"Incredible fight. Incredible fight.\"\n\nHis impressive career has included a men's record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent at the top of the rankings by a man or woman. It has also included a medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics, but it was bronze, and he made it clear that it simply wasn't enough.\n\nUntil he defeated Italian bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti in the semifinals on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games, losing each time to the eventual gold medallist: Rafael Nadal in Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray in London in 2012 and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nBefore facing Musetti, Djokovic said: \"I thought, 'OK, let's get through this.' That's why today, before the match, I wasn't as nervous as I normally would be, because I had won a medal.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over his right knee that had to undergo surgery two months ago for a torn meniscus, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and knocked out his old rival in three sets. Djokovic is now the oldest man to win singles gold in his sport since 1908 and prevented the 21-year-old Spaniard Alcaraz from becoming the youngest.\n\nWhen the victory was in the bag, when the gold was in the bag, thanks to a final forehand winner, Djokovic turned to his team in the stands, where his wife and their two children were sitting, dropped his racket and knelt on the clay. As emotional as ever, he cried and covered his face, then stood up and picked up a red, white and blue Serbian flag.\n\nAfter hugging Djokovic in the stands, he waved the flag.\n\n\"In the difficult moments he gave it an extra push,\" silver medalist Alcaraz said through his own tears. \"It hurts to lose like that.\"\n\nThe Golden Slam has previously only been won by Germany's Steffi Graf (1988), America's Andre Agassi (1999), Spain's Rafael Nadal (2010) and America's Serena Williams (2012).\n\nThe final, which lasted 2 hours and 50 minutes despite being decided in just two sets, was a repeat of the Wimbledon title clash three weeks ago, which Alcaraz won as a follow-up to his title at Roland Garros in June.\n\nAlcaraz also defeated Djokovic in last year's final at the All England Club, but Djokovic won when they met in the semi-finals of Roland Garros in 2023, the annual clay-court tournament held at Roland Garros, the tennis venue used during these Olympic Games.\n\nSunday's match was one of Djokovic's best ever, and Alcaraz's best right now. It could indeed be frustrating for Djokovic to find himself up against a younger, faster version of himself. Perhaps that's why Djokovic often looked up, gestured and mumbled toward his guest box.\n\nYet he emerged as the winner.\n\n\"Honestly, when the last ball went through him, past him, that was the only moment I thought I could win the match,\" Djokovic said.\n\nIt required long exchanges full of great ball-striking, deft drop shots - Alcaraz's were usually more successful, sometimes so good that Djokovic refused to even pursue - and great sprinting, sliding, stretching defence on both sides. They served so well that neither was broken once: Djokovic saved eight break points, Alcaraz six.\n\nPerhaps most remarkable was how cleanly both men played, despite the talent of the opponent and the pressure of the occasion.\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans and, of course, Alcaraz, was that the Olympics used a best-of-three-set format, rather than the best-of-five format of Grand Slam tournaments. Make no mistake, this encounter between top-seeded Djokovic and second-seeded Alcaraz was worthy of a major final.\n\nYet between performances it became as quiet as in a theatre. So quiet that the performance was briefly postponed when the air was filled with anticipation with the cry of a young child.\n\nBoth men played for the crowd. When Alcaraz raced to reach a drop shot and deposit it over the net for a winner, he enjoyed the noisy reaction by pointing his right index finger to his ear. When Djokovic hit a cross-court forehand winner to seal a 10-stroke point and go 3-2 up in the second tiebreaker, he waved both arms above his head to encourage the crowd already standing and shouting.\n\nThe first set alone lasted over 1 1/2 hours, filled with epic shots and epic games. One set lasted 18 points over a dozen mesmerizing minutes, including five break chances for Alcaraz, before Djokovic managed to hold on to a 5-4 lead. In the tiebreaker, Djokovic was superior in crunch time, as he so often is, and took the last four points.\n\nAt 3-all, Alcaraz delivered a body serve, but Djokovic slid just enough to his left to hit a cross-court forehand return winner. After two errors from Alcaraz, Djokovic produced a volley winner and turned to his family with a fist raised.\n\nOne more set and one more tiebreak later, and Djokovic finally had the medal he wanted.\n\nWhen the Serbian anthem was over, Djokovic took the gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.\n\nThe first medal for a Russian athlete at the 2024 Olympics, who did not officially represent her country but participated as a neutral participant due to the war in Ukraine, came in tennis on Sunday, when Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider won silver in the women's doubles.\n\nAndreeva and Shnaider lost the final to Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini of Italy 2-6, 6-1, 10-7 in a tiebreak.\n\nAthletes from Russia and Belarus will compete at the Paris Games as Individual Neutral Athletes, known by the French acronym AIN. These countries were banned from team sports at the Paris Games by the International Olympic Committee due to the attack on Ukraine that began in February 2022.\n\nIndividual athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports were allowed to compete as neutral participants if they qualified and were subsequently approved to participate in the Olympic Games.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com",

He had tried five times to win the gold, failing each time.\n\nThat finally changed Sunday.\n\nAt the Roland Garros stadium where he had injured his knee only months earlier, and across the net from the face of tennis' new guard -- 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz -- who had defeated him at Wimbledon this summer, the 37-year-old veteran finally struck gold.\n\nAlcaraz did not make it easy for Djokovic, however. The two sets played had to go into a tiebreaker, which was neck and neck the entire way. During the first set, there were 13 unsuccessful break points. The match lasted nearly three hours, an eternity for earning the best two sets out of three.\n\nThe crowd was extremely rowdy, with both players visibly frustrated by screams and shouts, and officials repeatedly asking the crowd to be quiet.\n\nBut Djokovic came out on top, defeating Alcaraz 7(7)-6(3), 7(7)-6(2).\n\nAfter the match, Djokovic collapsed on the floor. He was shaking and crying, with a towel over his head. He jumped into the crowd to embrace his family.

Since then, Djokovic has won 24 Grand Slam titles in his career -- the most of any man in history.\n\nWhether Djokovic will pass the baton to the new guard and the likes of Alcaraz isn't certain, but this win solidifies him in the company of tennis legends.\n\n\"I'm telling myself always that I am enough, because I can be very self critical,\" Djokovic said. \"That's probably one of the biggest internal battles that I keep on fighting with myself, that I don't feel that I've done enough -- that I have been enough in my life on the court and off the court.\"\n\nWhile Djokovic's quest for gold is finally complete, Alcaraz's silver is prescient of what is to come for tennis' next superstar.\n\nThe 21-year-old is the youngest man to win a medal in the Olympics singles tournament since Djokovic, who won bronze in 2008.\n\n\"I am a little bit disappointed but I'm going to leave the court with my head high,\" Alcaraz said. \"I gave everything that I had.

It will be a historic match for the gold medal at the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nSerbia's Novak Djokovic, the world No. 2 and the owner of the most Grand Slam singles titles in tennis history with 24, will face Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, the world No. 3 and winner of the last two Grand Slam tournaments this year. Alcaraz won the French Open on the same court as the Olympic Games, Roland Garros, and followed that up with his second Wimbledon title, which he won by beating Djokovic in straight sets.\n\nRead more: Carlos Alcaraz makes tennis history after beating Novak Djokovic in Wimbledon final\n\nDjokovic, to be fair, was still recovering from a medial meniscus tear in his right knee suffered in that Wimbledon loss three weeks ago. He is presumably healthier now.\n\nIn his semi-final on Friday, Djokovic defeated Italian Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-2. In his semi-final, Alcaraz defeated Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-1, 6-1.\n\nWhatever happens during their meeting, history will be made on Sunday. The 37-year-old Djokovic would become the oldest player to win a gold medal, while the 21-year-old Alcaraz, who has won four majors, would be the youngest.\n\nOn his way to the final, Djokovic swept his old on-court rival, Rafael Nadal, off the floor, who second- most men's Grand Slam singles titles ever, with 24. Despite being only a year older than Djokovic, Nadal appears to be much closer to the end of his career than the Serbian superstar. Part of that may be a style issue, as Djokovic is far more defensive and measured in his play, while Nadal plays a considerably more frenetic, grinding style that appears to have worn out his knees.\n\nRead more: Olympic Tennis: Novak Djokovic Defeats Rafael Nadal in Men's Singles Competition\n\nThe action kicks off Sunday morning in the United States at 3 a.m. PT/6 a.m. ET. It will air on NBC. The contest can also be streamed on Peacock (NBC's sister site), DirecTV Stream, fubo and Hulu + Live TV.\n\nPer Howard Fendrich of The Associated PressDjokovic had an interesting assessment of the match before their meeting.\n\n\"The way he plays, he is definitely a favorite,\" Djokovic said of Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic has never won more than the sole bronze medal he won at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Nadal won gold that year. This will be Djokovic's first ever Olympic final.\n\n\"You know, I've been waiting for this for almost 20 years,\" Djokovic said during a post-match chat with NBC's Britney Eurton, per Sean Leahy of Yahoo Sports\"I've played four Olympics; this is my fifth and I've never made it past the semi-finals. So I lost three of the four semi-finals in my first four Olympics and I've managed to overcome this big hurdle.\"\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic have played each other six times in tournaments and are locked at 3-3 in those encounters. Alcaraz is 2-0 against Djokovic on grass courts, while Djokovic is 2-0 on hard courts.

The 24-time Grand Slam title winner now becomes the oldest player to claim Olympic gold in men's singles in history, at age 37. He was playing what would have been the youngest men's singles title winner in Olympic history -- Alcaraz is just 21.\n\nThe win also marks Djokovic's first tournament title of the year, as he had to undergo surgery on a right knee medial meniscus tear suffered the last time he was at Roland Garros, the 2024 French Open.\n\nNeither player was able to convert a single break point. The win was ultimately decided by a handful of points in the tiebreak. Alcaraz was 0-for-8 in break points.\n\nDjokovic is one of only four players, male or female, in the history of tennis to join the so-called \"Golden Slam Club\" -- defined as winning all four Grand Slam tournaments and an Olympic gold singles medal. He joins German star Steffi Graf, Graf's eventual husband Andre Agassi, Spaniard Rafael Nadal, and American Serena Williams in cementing the achievement.\n\nGraf won 22 Grand Slam singles titles and the Olympic gold in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The Las Vegas-born Agassi, like Graf a former world No. 1, claimed eight Grand Slam championships, and won the gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nNadal is a more recent world No. 1 and the only still-active player in this group, along with Djokovic. The \"King of Clay\" has won the second-most men's Grand Slam titles in history behind only Djokovic, with 22. He earned his gold medal in the 2008 Beijing games, where Djokovic had claimed his previous best finish -- a bronze medal. Williams, also another longtime world No. 1 and the winner of 23 women's Grand Slam tournaments, won her Olympic gold medal at the 2012 games in London.\n\nRoger Federer, the third-winningest men's Grand Slam singles champion with 20 such titles, did win an Olympic gold medal, too -- albeit in men's doubles with Swiss countryman Stanislas Wawrinka at the 2008 Games.\n\nIt took Djokovic five Olympics to sew up his first men's singles title in the tournament. This may have been Djokovic's last, best shot at claiming gold. He would be 41 when the 2028 Olympics roll around in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I'm overwhelmed with everything that I'm feeling right now,\" Djokovic told NBC sideline reporter Britney Eurton. \"Millions of different emotions of course, positive. Too proud, too happy, thrilled with the possibility to fight for a gold and to win a gold for the first time in my career for my country. Arguably the biggest success I ever had. Of course I won everything there is to win probably in my individual career, but winning [the] Davis Cup and particularly [the gold] medal at Olympic games for Serbia at age 37 is unprecedented.\"\n\n\"I'm super grateful for the blessing to win a historic gold medal for my country, to complete the 'Golden Slam,' to complete all the records,\" Djokovic added.\n\nDjokovic still has an opportunity to win his first Grand Slam title of the ATP season. The U.S. Open begins play in New York later this month. Should Djokovic fail to win there, it would mark his first year without a major title since a similarly injury-riddled 2017 season.\n\nAlcaraz won both this year's French Open and Wimbledon. At the latter tournament, he beat Djokovic in straight sets. He is the youngest player in men's tennis history to win four Grand Slams before the age of 22.\n\nRead More: Carlos Alcaraz Makes Tennis History After Beating Novak Djokovic in Wimbledon Final\n\nDjokovic now leads his individual head-to-head record with Alcaraz, 4-3. Djokovic leads 2-1 Alcaraz on clay courts and 2-0 on clay.\n\n\"It is painful to lose the way that I lost this match. I had my opportunities,\" Alcaraz conceded in his own post-match interview with Eurton. \"I couldn't take it. Novak is playing great. He deserved this position. In the difficult moments, [he] increases his level... I'm very disappointed, but honestly I'm going to leave the court with my head very high. I gave everything that I head. Fighting for Spain, it was everything for me, so I'm proud [of] the way that I played today.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I gave it everything I had in order to earn the gold.\n\n\"I did it first for Serbia, my country.\"\n\nAfter winning all four Grand Slams and the Olympic gold medal in their careers, Djokovic enters the select group of athletes that includes Andre Agassi, Rafa Nadal, Serena Williams, and Steffi Graf.\n\nIt takes something really exceptional to overshadow the men's 100-meter final at the Stade de France later on, but Alcaraz and Djokovic's sixth career meeting may have come close with their thrilling bout.\n\nThirty captivating minutes were spent in just the first four games, where nearly every rally was a struggle for dominance.\n\nWhen Djokovic served at 4-4, Alcaraz looked menacing as he unleashed his full armament on the Serb, saving three break points in the fourth game.\n\nDjokovic was forced to grin at his opponent's skill on multiple occasions as he applied pressure to earn five break points, but he managed to hold onto his serve.\n\nAlcaraz prevented a set point at 5-6, but in the tiebreak, the Spaniard's play deteriorated a little, and Djokovic took the lead without a second invitation.\n\nDeep into the second set, Djokovic increased his energy even more, sensing his moment, but Alcaraz held firm.\n\nDjokovic, on the other hand, was unrelenting. He ended the match fast by winning the 99th and, possibly, most memorable title of his illustrious career with an incredible forehand winner at 2-2 in the breaker, which broke Alcaraz's resistance.", "source": {"uri": "pakistankakhudahafiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PKKH.tv"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://pakistankakhudahafiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/042221538f45cb9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Out of all Grand Slam title wins, Novak Djokovic termed his PlayStation-like performance against Carlos Alcaraz in the Paris Olympics 2024 tennis final as the biggest achievement of his career on Sunday. Does that mean Djokovic will draw curtains after completing his career Golden Slam? Nole doesn't think so. The top seed still believes he has so much left in his tank as the Serbian ace wants to headline the Los Angeles Games 2028 after adding the elusive Olympic gold to his overflowing trophy cabinet.\n\nAn emotional Djokovic admitted that he put his heart and soul on the line to claim his maiden Olympic gold medal at the Paris Games. Overcoming a 16-year age gap in the Roland Garros classic, Djokovic outclassed his newest singles rival, Alcaraz, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) to end his long quest for an Olympic gold in Paris yesterday. The 37-year-old suffered Olympic heartbreaks in Beijing, London, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo editions before the top seed set his showdown clash with the Wimbledon champion in the Paris Games tennis final.\n\nALSO READ: Paris Olympics: Novak Djokovic fights off Carlos Alcaraz to finally strike gold\n\nDjokovic was outclassed by Alcaraz in the final at the All-England Club this year. Two months before the Summer Games, Djokovic tore his meniscus at the same venue in the fourth round of the French Open. Wearing a grey sleeve over the right knee throughout his Olympics 2024 campaign, Djokovic was early out of the block to take crucial time away from the Spaniard, who was branded Rafael Nadal 2.0 by the commentator in Paris. The first set of the summit clash at the Paris Games lasted more than 1\u00bd hours. Djokovic saved eight break points to have the bragging rights of the opening set.\n\nServing superbly, Djokovic remained keen on testing Alcaraz with his net assault. Djokovic banked on his shot selection; Alcaraz enhanced his errors in the tiebreak. A monstrous forehand return winner paved the way for Djokovic to go past Alcaraz at 3-3. Nole's drop volley winner concluded the marathon set. Despite manufacturing an early break point in the second set, Djokovic was kept in check by Alcaraz as the previous Grand Slam finalist entered another tiebreak. The two top seeds brought out a PlayStation-like feel to the unforgettable Paris Games final. However, it was the 24-time Grand Slam winner, who bagged the last four points in the tiebreaker. The 37-year-old fired an explosive forehand winner down the line to rewrite his name into the record books for the umpteenth time.\n\nDjokovic's best-ever run before the Paris final was a bronze in singles at the Beijing Games in 2008. Swiss marvel Roger Federer was at 12 Grand Slams, and King of Clay Rafael Nadal had cemented his French Open legacy when Djokovic unlocked his first major at the Australian Open back in 2008. Novak's next Grand Slam arrived in 2011. Fast-forwarding the clock to the present, the Serbian is in a league of his own with 24 Grand Slams. His closest arch-rival is four Grand Slams behind the Serbian ace.\n\nDjokovic's hands visibly shook following the epoch-making win over Alcaraz in the Olympics final. 'Dad is the best' - Djokovic's daughter Tara had a sign ready for the top seed as his children were in the box for the Olympic gold medal match. Breaking down into tears, Djokovic shared an emotional hug with his daughter and family after striking gold for Serbia at the Summer Games. Without dropping a set in the men's singles tournament, Djokovic became the oldest player to win an Olympic singles gold medal.\n\nBefore Sunday, being Serbia's flag bearer at the opening ceremony of the London Games was the proudest moment of the top seed. Out of the 24 majors, half of his Grand Slam wins have arrived after turning 30. At the age of 37, Djokovic has also completed tennis with his Golden Slam. He is the fifth player after icons Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams to complete a career Golden Slam by achieving all four Grand Slam events and Olympic gold in singles events.

Doesn't matter a bit how long it took. Djokovic beat Carlos Alcaraz, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2), in an enthralling and evenly matched men's tennis singles final at the 2024 Games on Sunday.\n\n\"I put my heart, my soul, my body, my family -- my everything -- on the line to win Olympic gold,\" Djokovic said. \"Incredible battle. Incredible fight.\"\n\nHis impressive career already featured a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nNow Djokovic is the oldest man to win the singles gold in his sport since 1908 and prevented Spain's Alcaraz, who is 21, from becoming the youngest.\n\nWhen the victory was his, when the gold was his, thanks to one last forehand winner, Djokovic turned toward his team in the stands -- sitting in front of his wife and their two children -- dropped his racket and knelt on the clay. As emotional as ever, he cried and covered his face, then rose and grabbed a red-white-and-blue Serbian flag.\n\nAfter hugs in the stands, Djokovic waved that flag.\n\n\"In the tough moments, he gave it an extra push,\" silver medalist Alcaraz said through his own tears. \"It hurts to lose like this.\"\n\nThe final, which lasted 2 hours, 50 minutes despite being decided in only two sets, was a rematch of the Wimbledon title match three weeks ago that Alcaraz won to follow up his French Open title in June.\n\nAlcaraz also defeated Djokovic in last year's final at the All England Club, but Djokovic won when they met in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open, the annual clay-court tournament held at Roland Garros, the site used for tennis during these Olympics.\n\nSunday's contest featured one of the best to ever do it in Djokovic, and the best at the moment in Alcaraz. Indeed, could have been frustrating for Djokovic to find himself once again across the net from a younger, speedier version of himself. Maybe that's why Djokovic frequently looked up and gesticulated and muttered toward his guest box.\n\nStill, he came out on top.\n\n\"Honestly, when the last shot went through him, past him, that was the only moment I actually thought I can win the match,\" Djokovic said.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@triblive.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/08/7601279_web1_7601279-0702b8d96a294b86af98171f26a84736.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

After all, if there was one tennis match Djokovic could have picked to win at the start of the year, it wouldn't have been the Wimbledon final.\n\nJust 21 days later, an inspired Djokovic earned revenge and ended his long quest for a first Olympic gold medal, defeating Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in an all-time final at Roland Garros.\n\nAt 37 and at his fifth Olympics, Djokovic captured the one title that had so far evaded him in a bid to complete the career golden slam. Two months after tearing his meniscus in his right knee and appearing to be a doubt for the Games when he underwent surgery, Djokovic returned to the same court on Philippe-Chatrier to record one of the greatest victories of his career against his young rival, delivering a gold medal for Serbia that he ranked above his record 24 grand slam titles as his \"biggest sporting achievement\".\n\nIn doing so, he managed to suppress Alcaraz just as the Spaniard appeared to be a level above what Djokovic was able to produce at this stage of his career. Djokovic dug deep into his reserves, first denying and then outlasting Alcaraz in a titanic 93-minute opening set. He withstood Alcaraz's powers of athleticism and shot-making in an epic last stand that displayed a vintage look at his greatest qualities as a tennis player. Djokovic endured, remaining solid in all aspects of his game, and delivered when the biggest moments arrived to claim a historic victory in one of the most memorable Olympics finals ever staged.\n\nAnd with 10 Australian Opens, three French Opens, seven Wimbledon, four US Opens, seven ATP Finals and 40 ATP 1000 titles, Djokovic now has the Olympic gold to tick the one box missing in his illustrious career. By becoming just the fifth player to complete the career grand slam in singles, he joins Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi, Serena Williams and Steffi Graf to claim another major milestone.\n\nDjokovic needed to be at his very best to beat Alcaraz with history on the line, but he found a level that had looked beyond him for much of the season. Incredibly, the Serbian also ends an eight-month title drought at the most important event of his year.\n\n\"I'm super thrilled that I managed to do it here in the way that I did it, against a guy who is the best in the world at the moment. I'm just over the moon,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"Everything that I felt in that moment when I won really surpassed everything I thought or hoped that it would. I thought that carrying the flag at the opening ceremony (in London) was the best feeling ever until I experienced this today.\n\n\"And being on that court with the Serbian flag raising, singing the Serbian anthem, with the gold around my neck, I think nothing can beat that in terms of professional sport. It definitely stands out as the biggest sporting achievement I had.\"\n\nA monumental final brought the rawest emotions: there weren't many new feelings in the sport for Djokovic to experience but winning gold for his country was one. First, there was shock, as he dropped his racket and turned to his box, eyes wide. Then came the tears, as he dropped to the clay and looked to the sky, shaking through sobs. At the far end of the court, Alcaraz was unable to speak as he was interviewed on TV, turning away to cover his face. He will have many more chances. Djokovic, who will be 41 by the time the next Olympics in Los Angeles arrive, knew this was it, adding another layer to a legendary performance that flipped the script.\n\nDjokovic admitted he felt \"inferior\" to Alcaraz after his humbling defeat in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago. On a hot, still afternoon at Roland Garros, the Olympic final was incomparable. Djokovic played at a much higher level in an opening set that brought a combined 13 break-point opportunities with Djokovic saving eight himself. He saved five of them in a monumental ninth game of the set, keeping his opponent at bay when any one of them would have given Alcaraz the chance to serve for the set. As Alcaraz pressed for the advantage, producing a series of stunning retrievals, Djokovic was left chuckling in disbelief at what it was taking just to win a point.\n\nBut Djokovic survived to reach the tiebreak, waiting for his moment to strike. After the first six points were split, Djokovic snapped up a slower second serve from Alcaraz to fire a forehand winner. Alcaraz momentarily lost his composure and two consecutive misses from the baseline handed Djokovic set point. As Djokovic sent Alcaraz wide to his right, the Spaniard lined up the sensational forehand crosscourt winner on the run. But when he looked up, Djokovic was already there, lunging to his right to land a soft drop volley. Djokovic stayed in the same position with his arm raised as he edged ahead.\n\nAn hour later, they stood in the same position as the second tiebreak arrived. Alcaraz had managed to stay alive in the match, passing awkward moments on serve, but was unable to find momentum. Alcaraz remaining in the match, though, could have been an ominous sign. Since winning the French Open two months ago, the Spaniard has managed to find a way to battle from behind time and time and again. Instead, Djokovic found another level in the tiebreak - an epic final reaching its grand conclusion.\n\nSeven points from victory and knowing how difficult it had been to put Alcaraz away, Djokovic used the Spaniard's tricks against him. In the key moment of the second tiebreak, Djokovic on the run dispatched a fine winner, running so wide to his left that he almost disappeared from the screen. As he hung up a lob that dropped inside the baseline, Alcaraz blinked, with a forehand slumping into the net.\n\nIt broke Alcaraz, and lifted Djokovic. From there, he produced three of the cleanest forehands he is ever likely to strike, throwing his entire weight behind a crosscourt winner that snapped viciously past Alcaraz. After falling behind, Alcaraz made two poor errors to give Djokovic match point. Sensing his moment, he held nothing back and another forehand winner, this time down the line, secured this final piece of tennis history.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lob (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serve (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_us_sports_articles_270/ea46fdafb7dd6b6945c853743e15e3fd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

I did it for my country first, for Serbia.\"\n\nIn a raucous atmosphere, with football-style chants shattering the calm of the adjacent Bois de Boulogne, neither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest.\n\nThe first set alone lasted one hour and 33 minutes as the two wrestled for control in a series of spellbinding games, including one at 4-4 in which Djokovic repelled five break points.\n\nAlcaraz blinked first in the tiebreak, allowing Djokovic to move ahead. When another tiebreak was required to decide the second set, Djokovic found inspiration once more, moving 6-2 in front and sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner.\n\nDjokovic roared to the sky and, after consoling a crestfallen Alcaraz at the net, fell to his knees and sobbed into the Parisian clay in the center of the court before climbing into the crowd, where he was swamped by his family, friends and team.\n\nWhile Djokovic became the oldest Olympic singles champion since tennis returned to the Games in 1988, the 21-year-old Alcaraz looked inconsolable after failing to add the gold medal to this year's French Open and Wimbledon crowns.\n\n\"I think I had a really great tournament, I think I played a really great match,\" the four-time Grand Slam champion said. \"Obviously, in front of me, I had a really hungry Novak.\"\n\nDjokovic had lost three times in Olympic singles semifinals with a solitary bronze medal to show from four previous Games.\n\nHe knew Paris was his last realistic chance to fill the remaining space in a bulging trophy cabinet containing 24 Grand Slam titles.\n\nAnd how he earned it - overturning a crushing loss to Alcaraz three weeks ago in the Wimbledon final to become the first man to win the Olympic singles title without dropping a set.\n\nDjokovic joins an elite group including Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams, the latter watching from the front row, in the Golden Slam club. Many will say this settled the G.O.A.T. argument once and for all.\n\nIt takes something pretty special to upstage the men's 100-meter final later at the Stade de France, but this nearly three-hour red-dirt duel arguably came close.\n\nThe opening four games spanned 30 mesmerizing minutes, every rally a battle of skill and will. Alcaraz saved three break points in the fourth game and looked menacing as he threw everything in his arsenal at Djokovic as the Serb served at 4-4.\n\nSeveral times, Djokovic could only smile at the athleticism of his opponent, who piled on the pressure to earn five break points, and somehow, Djokovic survived.\n\nAlcaraz saved a set point at 5-6, but the Spaniard's level dipped in the tiebreak, and Djokovic pounced to grab the lead. Sensing his moment, Djokovic's intensity went even higher deep in the second set, but Alcaraz hung on.\n\nDjokovic was relentless, and an outrageous forehand winner at 2-2 in the breaker snapped Alcaraz's resistance. The end came quickly as Djokovic claimed the 99th and perhaps most valuable title of his glittering career.\n\nA memorable week ended with Italy's Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini beating Russian neutral players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider 2-6, 6-1 (10-7) to win the women's gold, adding to compatriot Lorenzo Musetti's men's singles bronze.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com",

Doesn't matter a bit how long it took. Djokovic beat Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in an enthralling and evenly matched men's tennis singles final at the 2024 Games on Sunday.\n\n\"I put my heart, my soul, my body, my family -- my everything -- on the line to win Olympic gold,\" Djokovic said. \"Incredible battle. Incredible fight.\"\n\nHis impressive career already featured a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nBefore facing Musetti, Djokovic said, \"I was like, 'OK, let's get through this one.' That's why today, before the match, I did not feel as nervous as I would normally feel, because I had secured a medal.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets. Now Djokovic is the oldest man to win the singles gold in his sport since 1908 -- and prevented Spain's Alcaraz, who is 21, from becoming the youngest.\n\nWhen the victory was his, when the gold was his, thanks to one last forehand winner, Djokovic turned toward his team in the stands -- sitting in front of his wife and their two children -- dropped his racket and knelt on the clay. As emotional as ever, he cried and covered his face, then rose and grabbed a red-white-and-blue Serbian flag.\n\nAfter hugs in the stands, Djokovic waved that flag.\n\n\"In the tough moments, he gave it an extra push,\" silver medalist Alcaraz said through his own tears. \"It hurts to lose like this.\"\n\nThe final, which lasted 2 hours, 50 minutes despite being decided in only two sets, was a rematch of the Wimbledon title match three weeks ago that Alcaraz won to follow up his French Open title in June.\n\nAlcaraz also defeated Djokovic in last year's final at the All England Club, but Djokovic won when they met in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open, the annual clay-court tournament held at Roland Garros, the site used for tennis during these Olympics.\n\nSunday's contest featured one of the best to ever do it in Djokovic, and the best at the moment in Alcaraz. Indeed, could have been frustrating for Djokovic to find himself once again across the net from a younger, speedier version of himself. Maybe that's why Djokovic frequently looked up and gesticulated and muttered toward his guest box.\n\nStill, he came out on top.\n\n\"Honestly, when the last shot went through him, past him, that was the only moment I actually thought I can win the match,\" Djokovic said.\n\nIt required long exchanges filled with superb ball-striking, deft drop shots -- Alcaraz's tended to be more successful, sometimes so good Djokovic declined to even give chase -- and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense at both ends. They served so well that neither got broken even once: Djokovic saved eight break points, Alcaraz six.\n\nMost remarkable, perhaps, was how cleanly both men played, despite the talent of the opposition and pressure of the occasion.\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, Alcaraz -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Make no mistake, this encounter between the No. 1-seeded Djokovic and No. 2-seeded Alcaraz was worthy of a major final.\n\nThose in the stands became part of the show, repeatedly breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. In the second set, as Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters began chanting, \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\") while shaking their red-and-yellow flags. Chair umpire Damien Dumusois occasionally reminded folks to remain silent during the action.\n\nYet the place also became as quiet as a theater between points, enough so that play was delayed briefly when the air thick with anticipation was pierced by a young child's crying.\n\nBoth men played to the crowd. When Alcaraz raced to reach one drop shot and deposit it over the net for a winner, he basked in the raucous reaction by pointing his right index finger to his ear. When Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point to lead 3-2 in the second tiebreaker, he waved both arms overhead to encourage folks who already were standing and screaming.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes, including five break chances for Alcaraz, before Djokovic managed to hold for a 5-4 lead. In the tiebreaker, Djokovic was superior in crunch time, as he so often is, taking the last four points.\n\nAt 3-all, Alcaraz delivered a body serve, but Djokovic slid just enough to his left to smack a cross-court forehand return winner. After two mistakes by Alcaraz, Djokovic produced a volley winner and turned to face his family with a fist held high.\n\nAnother set, and another tiebreaker, later, and Djokovic had that medal that he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out at Court Philippe Chatrier, Djokovic reached for that gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.", "source": {"uri":

It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze - and he has made clear that simply was not sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.

He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nNow Djokovic is the oldest man to win the singles gold in his sport since 1908 -- and prevented Spain's Alcaraz, who is 21, from becoming the youngest.\n\nSteffi Graf was the first player to win all four Grand Slam titles as well as an Olympic gold, when she managed the feat in 1988.\n\nAndre Agassi became the first man to complete a career Golden Slam in 1999, when he won his first and last French Open title.\n\nRafael Nadal is the youngest to achieve a career Golden Slam, when he achieved the feat in 2010 at the age of 24. Serena Williams completed her set of all four Grand Slam titles and an Olympic gold medal in 2012.\n\nNovak Djokovic joined the illustrious list of career Golden Slam winners, adding the Olympic gold to his 24 Grand Slam triumphs.\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" APF quoted Djokovic as saying. \"I put my body, my family on the line to win gold and finally I did it.\" He added.\n\n\"Three hours, a big battle with tough moments,\" said Alcaraz. The 21-year-old said it was very painful to lose.\n\nAlcaraz cracked first in the tiebreak and when another tiebreak was required to decide the second set, Djokovic again found another gear, sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner down the line.\n\nDjokovic roared to the sky and after shaking hands with Alcaraz, he fell to his knees in the center of the court before climbing into the crowd to be swamped by his family and team. He celebrated by holding aloft the Serbian flag on court.\n\nThe 21-year-old Alcaraz, who was denied the Olympic title to go with this year's French Open and Wimbledon crowns, was in tears at the end.\n\nDjokovic has won three of his six matches against Alcaraz, including in last year's French Open semi-finals, but the Spaniard has seized power in the men's game this year, winning the French and Wimbledon crowns back-to-back.\n\nDjokovic put on one of the finest performances of his career to deny Alcaraz the elusive title and became only the fifth player to complete a career Golden Slam -- winning all four singles Grand Slams and the Olympic title.\n\nThe opening set alone lasted an hour and 33 minutes, as neither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest. There were plenty of break points on display, but neither managed to get a break of serve as the set headed to the tie-break, where Alcaraz cracked.

I did it for my country first, for Serbia.\"\n\nIn a raucous atmosphere, with soccer-style chants shattering the calm of the adjacent Bois de Boulogne, neither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest.\n\nThe first set alone lasted one hour 33 minutes as the two wrestled for control in a series of spellbinding games, one at 4-4 in which Djokovic repelled five break points.\n\nAlcaraz blinked first in the tiebreak to allow Djokovic to move ahead and when another tiebreak was required to decide the second set, again Djokovic found inspiration, moving 6-2 in front and sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner.\n\nALSO READ: Olympics Day 9: Chinese swimmers surge up, Djokovic completes trophy collection\n\nDjokovic roared to the sky and after consoling a crestfallen Alcaraz at the net, then fell to his knees and sobbed into the Parisian clay in the center of the court before climbing into the crowd where he was swamped by his family, friends and team.\n\nWhile Djokovic became the oldest Olympic singles champion since tennis returned to the Games in 1988, the 21-year-old Alcaraz looked inconsolable after failing to add the gold medal to this year's French Open and Wimbledon crowns.\n\n\"I think I did a really great tournament, I think I did a really great match,\" the four-time Grand Slam champion said. \"Obviously in front of me, I had a really hungry Novak.\"\n\nDjokovic had lost three times in Olympic singles semi-finals with a solitary bronze medal to show from four previous Games.\n\nHe knew Paris was his last realistic chance to fill the remaining space in a bulging trophy cabinet containing 24 Grand Slam titles. And how he earned it - overturning a crushing loss to Alcaraz three weeks ago in the Wimbledon final to become the first man to win the Olympic singles title without dropping a set.\n\nIncredible fight\n\nDjokovic joins an elite group of Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams, the latter watching from the front row, in the Golden Slam club, and many will say this settled the G.O.A.T argument once and for all.\n\nIt takes something pretty special to upstage the men's 100 meters final taking place later at the Stade de France, but this near three-hour red-dirt duel arguably came close.\n\nThe opening four games spanned 30 mesmerizing minutes, every rally a battle of skill and wills. Alcaraz saved three break points in the fourth game and looked menacing as he threw everything in his arsenal at Djokovic as the Serb served at 4-4.\n\nSeveral times Djokovic could only smile at the athleticism of his opponent who piled on the pressure to earn five break points, and somehow he survived.\n\nAlcaraz saved a set point at 5-6 but the Spaniard's level dipped in the tiebreak and Djokovic pounced to grab the lead. Sensing his moment, Djokovic's intensity went even higher deep in the second set but Alcaraz hung on.\n\nREAD MORE: Tennis: China narrowly miss mixed doubles gold; Alcaraz, Djokovic set for final\n\nDjokovic was relentless though and an outrageous forehand winner at 2-2 in the breaker snapped Alcaraz's resistance and the end then came quickly as he claimed the 99th, and perhaps most valuable, title of his glittering career.\n\nA memorable week ended with Italy's Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini beating Russian neutral players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider 2-6 6-1 (10-7) to win the women's gold, adding to compatriot Lorenzo Musetti's men's singles bronze.", "source": {"uri": "chinadailyasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

I put my heart, my soul, everything to win gold.\n\n\"I did it for my country first, for Serbia.\"\n\nDjokovic joins an elite group of Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams, the latter watching from the front row, in the Golden Slam club.\n\nIt takes something pretty special to upstage the men's 100 metres final which was taking place later at the Stade de France, but a seventh career clash between Alcaraz and Djokovic arguably came close as they served up a blockbuster.\n\nThe opening four games alone spanned 30 mesmerizing minutes, with virtually every rally a battle of wills.\n\nAlcaraz saved three break points in the fourth game but began to look dangerous as he threw everything in his arsenal at Djokovic when the Serb served at 4-4.\n\nSeveral times Djokovic could only smile at the athleticism of his opponent who piled on the pressure to earn five break points, but somehow he emerged with his serve intact.\n\nAlcaraz saved a set point at 5-6 but the Spaniard's level dipped slightly in the tiebreak and Djokovic needed no second invitation to grab the lead.\n\nSensing his moment, Djokovic's intensity levels went even higher deep in the second set but Alcaraz hung on.\n\nDjokovic was relentless though and an outrageous forehand winner at 2-2 in the breaker snapped Alcaraz's resistance and the end then came quickly as he claimed the 99th, and perhaps most memorable, title of his glittering career.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The only empty space in his trophy cabinet - the one waiting for an Olympic gold medal - has now been filled, after a phenomenal near three-hour battle with his young rival Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic was visibly emotional after claiming a prize he had been seeking since he took bronze in the Olympic singles event of 2008. After clinching victory with a forehand winner, he knelt down on the court for an extended moment, and then pulled a Serbian flag out of his bag and roared as waved it to his fans.\n\n\"To win Olympic gold at 37, I finally did it,\" said Djokovic in an interview with Eurosport's Alex Corretja at the side of the court. \"Most of all, it's my country. The pride of playing for Serbia. I know Carlos and Rafa [Nadal] love to play for Spain, Andy [Murray] loves to play for Great Britain. Roger [Federer] for Switzerland. Alex Zverev won at Tokyo for Germany. You saw the reactions of all these guys when they win; it's something special.\"\n\nWith the exception of Federer, all the names that Djokovic mentioned were on show in this Olympic tennis event. Yet Murray and Nadal were shadows of their former selves, their bodies rebelling against the sheer workload of two decades of top-level tennis.\n\nDjokovic, extraordinarily, is still fresh. Yes, he might have been wearing a sleeve on the knee that underwent surgery on a torn meniscus fewer than two months ago. But his movement was slick and his unrivalled strategic instincts - surely the most powerful weapon in his armoury - came through with a series of inspired choices under pressure.\n\nThere were no breaks of serve in this 7-6, 7-6 victory, but the quality of tennis and drama reached rare heights, particularly when Alcaraz made a strong push towards the end of the first set.\n\nDjokovic was on the back foot against a more explosive opponent, but he fell back on his courtcraft. Even when his shots were not as good as Alcaraz's, his decision-making was far sharper, and his nerve held strong on the biggest points.\n\nAlcaraz was emotional after the match, breaking down in tears as he gave his own interview to Eurosport. Seldom has a man played as well in defeat as Alcaraz did here, striking more than 40 clean winners in just two sets. But Alcaraz is 21, and his time will come again. The silver medal is one better than Djokovic - then exactly the same age - had managed in Beijing.\n\n\"This is now my fifth Olympic Games,\" said Djokovic. \"Three out of four I played semi-finals and never managed to overcome that hurdle for some reason. When I entered the court for the semi-finals against [Lorenzo] Musetti I was thinking about it and said 'let's get through this one'. That's why at the beginning of this match I was not as nervous as I had secured a medal but of course I was going for gold. It was intense on the court and I wanted to give it my best. I think the fact I qualified for the final already helped.\"\n\nAlcaraz had recently swatted Djokovic aside in a Wimbledon final that saw the younger man serve at a career-best level. But it was also true that Djokovic's movement was \"half-a-step\" - in his own words - behind where it needed to be, thanks to the after-effects of his knee operation.\n\nHere Djokovic took revenge in a match that gives him a narrow 4-3 edge in this fascinating head-to-head rivalry. Given the physicality of a wonderful contest, he must have been grateful that this was best-of-three sets rather than best-of-five.\n\nOne interesting subplot now relates to the upcoming US Open, which is only three weeks away. Will Djokovic take strength from his ability to land big titles, even in the face of young challengers like Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner? Or will he find it difficult to remotivate himself after ticking off the final box on the tennis to-do list? New York will reveal all.\n\nThanks for tuning in for one of the greatest tennis match's in Olympics history, and the sport in general. There was so little separating these two and yet somehow, some way, Djokovic tapped into that otherworldly instinct and finally got his gold. You could see just how much it meant to him.\n\nAlcaraz is very emotional, now in tears and unable to give his interview. He gave everything here and lost by such a fine margin.\n\nDjokovic is sobbing uncontrollably on his bench here. He finally gets up to hoist the Serbian flag aloft and goes to celebrate with his family. What an incredible moment.\n\nHe's done it! Djokovic is in tears, broken on the court. He's only the fifth player to win it all. Djokovic has shown why he is the greatest to ever play the game.\n\nAnother one into the net and Djokovic will have 4 points to earn him that elusive gold medal. You've got to feel for Alcaraz here as he breaks at the crucial moment.\n\nAn unforced error from Alcaraz and that could be it. He was in a good position and nevertheless hit it too low into the net. Djokovic is in the driver's seat here.\n\nWhat a forehand from Djokovic which sends Alcaraz sliding again. He somehow gets something on it this time, but it's only enough to gift Djokovic the easy smash.\n\nWow! One of the best shots of the match. Djokovic again battling on the back foot but somehow manages to hit a missile of a forehand which Alcaraz at full stretch can't get anything on.\n\nThe crowd can hardly contain itself as the umpire is forced again to try helplessly to intervene.\n\nAlcaraz's serve is massive, forcing Djokovic to stretch and scream, setting him up for an easy winner\n\nAnother long rally and this time it's Alcaraz who comes out on top. Djokovic hits a forehand inches long and the Spaniard is back in it.\n\nSome shouts from the crowd delays Djokovic here. The crowd claps but Novak is less than amused.\n\nDjokovic on the defensive somehow survives an onslaught from Alcaraz, returning some absolute rockets and somehow reposturing to win the point. This is one of the all-time great performances from Djokovic.\n\nAlcaraz serves first but it's Djokovic who draws first blood, hitting a gorgeous forehand cross-court and out of reach.\n\nDjokovic has come to the net here to dispute the umpire's call. He's convinced the serve was in and that the umpire was looking at the wrong ball. Both seem unlikely to yield, but Alcaraz breaks the tension and gives the Serb his first serve back. He's thanked by a thumbs up from his opposition.\n\nDjokovic is playing his service games at such a high level. He serves hard, sets up his shot, and then executes. It's cold and clinical, each point more incisive than the next. 40-0.\n\nDjokovic win's the game and we're going into yet another tiebreak. I think anyone could have predicted this - there almost nothing separating these super-athletes\n\nDjokovic has saved eight break points up until this stage. Alcaraz has saved six. Somehow, we are yet to have a single break as we watch two of the world's greatest returners refuse to give their opposition an inch.\n\nAlcaraz swiftly builds up a 40-0 lead in this game. He makes no mistake, refusing to allow Djokovic to mount another tricky comeback and taking the lead in the set.\n\nAlcaraz is starting to establish himself in Djokovic's service games now, but Djokovic will not give anything up. He predicts the drop-shot, and times his run perfectly, giving himself time to place his return out of Alcaraz's reach and go up 30-15.\n\nAlcaraz hits a gorgeous backhand down the line which lands right in the back corner, saving himself game point at 40-30.\n\nIt's clear to see why they call him a machine. This performance has been masterful and without hitches. Djokovic forces Alcaraz out wide to his right, stretching to return it high and too long.\n\nWhat a fantastic point! Djokovic scrambles all over the court as Alcaraz drops and then lobs and somehow he continues to return. Finally Alacaraz puts the point to bed. Both have had some ridiculous defensive points taking every single one intensley personally.\n\nThat one took a lot of of Djokovic, who drops the next two points with some unforced errors.\n\nHe's back in it though, giving Alcaraz a chance to run. He's battled his way back to 30-40 in this pivotal game.\n\nA gorgeous drop-shot from Djokovic is met by Alcaraz who can only tip it over. The Serb thinks it was a double bounce but makes sure by blasting it past Alcaraz and saving his third game point in a row.\n\nAt deuce here and the bludgeoning continues. Back and forth some huge shots and gobble dup like they're nothing. Alcaraz finally blinks first and slices one short, forcing Djokovic to bend and lean. He smashes the return in style and goes 40-AD up.\n\nAvoiding disaster, Alcaraz plays the final point of the game beautifully, setting himself up to smash and roar to the adoring crowd.\n\nBoth players frustrated with the crowd here with the umpire having to warn them again at the request of Djokovic.\n\nDjokovic has only dropped one point on his serve thus far in this set, winning the first point quickly and decisively.\n\nAnother miraculous defensive point from Alcaraz who returns one far out to his left-hand side. Djokovic lines up to crack one down the line but the net had other ideas and clipped it wide - 15-15.\n\nAlcaraz has stepped it up here and its his turn to send Djokovic scampering wide after a stunning forehand cross-court. He somehow returns, but Alcaraz finishes.\n\nBack the other way now and Alcaraz growls at his team having given up an easy one.\n\nThis has been his toughest service game by far here as he goes up AD-40. Djokovic continues to wrongfoot the young Spaniard as he plays smarter and smarter. Both players are playing such a high difficulty level of tennis.\n\nDjokovic wins the game - are we going to see a break today?\n\nDjokovic is incensed with his team here as he drops the game to Alcaraz without much resistance.\n\nThat was much better from Carlos who made no mistakes.\n\nWhat a start to this game! A rally goes on and on before Djokovic goes for the kill with a drop shot. Alcaraz uses his pace to make up the ground before feinting a cross-court shot and hitting down the line. Gorgeous tennis.\n\nIt's Djokovic's turn to get frustrated as on the next point he hits long and belts out an expletive. 15-15.\n\nThat seems to have fired him up as he hits his first ace of the game to the dismay of Alcaraz who can only watch.\n\nAnother ridiculous rally favours Djokovic at 40-15 as the Serb somehow manages to defend some brutal strokes sending his return high and long. Alcaraz is too nonchalant, not smashing with enough pace and allowing Djokovic back into the point before hitting into the net.\n\nDjokovic takes the game.\n\nDjokovic's face tells all. Eyes wide open in a steely grimace. He wants this.\n\nAlcaraz hits another drop-shot which Djokovic meets, using the angle on his return. Somehow Alcaraz gets there and hooks it round, turning a tight angle into an impossible one and winning the point.\n\nAnother long and brutal rally ends in Alcaraz's favour as he lets out an almighty bellow on a forehand crusher down the line.\n\nA gorgeous backhand down the line form Djokovic at game-point forces Alcaraz to loop a forehand long. This is incredible tennis from the veteran who is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nNevertheless, Alcaraz does not relent, holding firm with some fantastic serving and refusing to be broken.\n\nA fantastic rally at 15-0 as both athletes send bludgeoning strikes across the net. Eventually the tension breaks as Alacaraz's forehand creeps out.\n\nA couple more misses from Alcaraz and Djokovic wins the game.\n\nThe frustration is setting in as Alcaraz waves his arms following a scuffed forehand. The crowd are getting behind him but he can't afford any more unforced errors like that as Djokovic postures.\n\nHe responds gloriously hitting a forehand to the far right-hand corner of the court with incredible precision, saving the break. Alcaraz then gets Djokovic running with a firm forehand down the line before putting it on the other side of the court.\n\nHe wins the game and roars like he's won the set. He needed that one.\n\nAlcaraz has made an adjustment in his serve return, positioning himself closer and more central on the baseline. Djokovic responds in kind, serving shorter to counter the counter, and it works.\n\nDjokovic goes up 30-0 with the Serbian contingent of the crowd roaring in support. The precision on his forehand winners are unbelievable.\n\nHe looks relaxed and confident here. Alcaraz bounces into a blasted forehand down the line, but Djokovic gives him the eyes and wrongfoots the Spaniard, sending it back from whence it came and holding his serve without dropping a point.\n\nAlcaraz is fired up here, eager to get himself back into rhythm quickly. He comes out firing and goes 40-0 up immediately.\n\nDjokovic stumbles when Alcaraz sends a shot destined to wrongfoot him - unluckily for the Spaniard it can't get over the net. Djokovic seems to enjoy making things harder for himself as he battles his way to deuce.\n\nAlcaraz hits an audacious forehand volley drop-shot, which, despite running for it, Djokovic simply can't reach.\n\nDjokovic refuses to die but Alcaraz's furious power gives sends him 40-AD up for the second time this game. Finally, Djokovic sends his backhand long and the game relents. Unsurprisingly, the intensity has not dropped from either player here.\n\nThat was an hour and thirty-three minutes of pure tennis brilliance. Alcaraz has won three of his matches quicker than that first set. Amazing stuff and we're about to get going for the second already!\n\nDjokivic wins the set! Alcaraz hits a drop shot that he's clearly unhappy with and visibly resigns before Djokovic can even reach it. Novak hits down the line, but Alcaraz snaps into action swinging a forehand cros-scourt. Somehow, Djokovic reaches it and volleys into the empty court.\n\nWhat an intense and tight set there. Both players refused to give up ground and Djokovic edged it purely on execution right at the end.\n\nDjokovic's serve is wide and out of reach of the young Spaniard and you can see the frustration set in. He has to visibly hold himself back from smashing his racket into the ground.\n\nThis could be the moment for Djokovic here as he takes a two-point lead.\n\nWhat a serve return from Djokovic who uses the momentum to crash the ball into the service box and away from Alcaraz's reach.\n\nAlcaraz's serve is too strong and Djokovic can't return. Again, we are level.\n\nA fantastic forehand from the left-hand side of the court from Djokovic sets up an easy volleyed return to a gaping hole on the other side of the court.\n\nThis time the backhand is a tad long from Alcaraz. There is nothing to separate these two.\n\nAlcaraz takes the lead with a crushing backhand.\n\nDjokovic wins the first point of the tiebreak after a nice rally but Alcaraz comes storming back in the second point. He launches a brutal forehand down the line which nobody could reach.\n\nDjokovic goes 0-15 up as he looks to steal this set. So far there's been almost nothing separating the two here but Novak senses blood in the water. He advances aggressively, hitting a crosscourt backhand low and true as he approaches mid-court. Alcaraz isn't having any of it though, and returns down the line and out of reach, earning a clap from Djokovic who knows he's been bested there.\n\nAlcaraz follows that up with another forehand slice which Djokovic, at 37 years old, has no intention of wasting his energy on. 30-15 Alcaraz.\n\nA nice rally gives Alcaraz an opportunity to volley into a gaping right-hand side of the court. Somehow he gets it wrong, dropping it into the net and given Djokovic set point.\n\nOf course, he's not doen there though, hitting a gorgeous sweeping forehand out of reach of the stretching Serb. Deuce.\n\nAlcaraz gets a couple of serves right and we're into the tiebreak. This set deserved it.\n\nThe crowd liked that one. Alcaraz rocks back, shaping up for a huge forehand and then cuts through the ball, placing the perfect drop-shot.\n\nDjokovic hesitates a couple of times before his serve as the silenced is pierced by the sound of a baby crying. No doubt as a father of young children that noise has become a daily battle for him. When he does finally get his serve off it's inch pefect and sets up an easy winner following Alcaraz's stretched return - clearly not too distracted.\n\n40-30 up, Djokovic has to sprint to reach one of Alcaraz's torturous short slices. He manages to return this one, and the Spaniard's lob is long, giving Novak the game. He'll have a tie-break at the least.\n\nDjokovic is livid here as he commits an unforced error at the end of a long rally - he knows he can't afford to give up anything easy here.\n\nThere is no such thing as a drop-shot to Alcaraz. Djokovic continues to test him, but the Spaniard is meeting everything at the net. Nevertheless, he sends this one too wide as he tries to give Djokovic no chance of returning.\n\nAnother rare unforced error from Djokovic there as he sends a fairly straightforward backhand long. Alcaraz senses weakness and finishes the game off. Djokovic almost never makes those mistakes and will be furious.\n\nAlcaraz predicts the drop-shot from Djokovic there. The Serb holds his ground though, putting the Spaniard off as he scuffs it in between the tramlines.\n\nThe defence from Alcaraz is impregnable. Djokic blasts a forehand to the far right corner which forces a sliding Alcaraz to return high. Djokovic smashes, but Alcaraz returns, resulting in a stunned Novak hitting an easy one into the net. Again Alcaraz defends, showing off his wheels as he somehow returns a short one despite starting from the other side of the court. Djokovic wins the point and can't help but laugh at the sheer speed of his opponent.\n\nAlcaraz forces break point and almost delivers after again returning a couple of smashes from Djokovic which I'm convinced only he could do. No shot is too hard or too far for this man.\n\nDjokovic continues to shake his head. His forehand clips the net giving Alcaraz time to think. Expecting it to come hard and fast, he cups it over the net, giving Djokovic no chance.\n\nWe're going back and forth here as Djokovic saves break-point after break-point. he simply cannot believe some of the returns his opponent is conjuring up.\n\nThe Serb starts to push back, earning a couple of game-points of his own but Alcaraz holds on, coming up with some ingenious manoeuvres to get himself back in it.\n\nDjokovic finally converts after a long game - it feels like this will be a pivotal one as somehow Alcaraz walks away without a break.\n\nOnly seven unforced errors from Djokovic to Alcaraz's eleven, but that's two in this game alone. He goes for a backhand slice to get the Spaniard running but it won't creep over the net. Next he tries a cross-court forehand which again falls too short.\n\nIt's all tied up here as Djokovic has been the only one to threaten a break thus far.\n\nAlcaraz lets out a yell of frustration as he mishits Djokovic's serve sending it vertical. It's Djokovic's turn to up the ante, matching Alcaraz's rampaging forehand with his own two-handed crusher.\n\nThat'll be seven holds so far as Djokovic exorcizes whatever demons caused him such trouble at Wimbledon - perhaps the extra couple of weeks post operation has returned the power that he was so clearly missing.\n\nHow are you supposed to return that forehand? Alcaraz makes quick work of that game and is strutting his stuff, bumping his head to the music.\n\nIt's Alcaraz's turn to complain here as Djokovic sends him scampering to his right before smashing a forehand volley down the line.\n\nHe comes back straight away though, darting forward to return a short one, placing it just on the line. The athleticism is on full display as he follows this rapid movement with a crashing backhand which wrongfoots Djokovic and earns him a break point.\n\nDjokovic saves three break-points as this turns into a chess match with both players making adjustments after each point, countering the other's. He finally gets his serve spot on, setting up an easy smash to win the game.\n\nA fantastic rally at 15-0 here as both players blast shots cross-court with immense power. Alcaraz is liking the short shots but Djokovic predicted that one and finishes it to the gaping right-hand side of the court.\n\nThe Serbian is picking his moments, waiting for Alcaraz to make mistakes at times, but knowing when to unleash a venomous winner. He goes 40-0 up and has three break-points.\n\nAnd just like that, Alcaraz brings it level. Djokovic is venting to his team after a missed opportunity and the crowd doesn't like it - a frustrated shrug illustrates his lack of patience for the loud criticism.\n\nHe brings it all the way back and totally reverses the momentum in this game. The precision on the forehand is back as he sends Djokovic this way and then that, ultimately setting up an easy volley winner with the Serb too far to even consider a return.\n\nDjokovic misplaces a smash after forcing Alcaraz into a stretching and sliding back-handed backhand return. The Spaniard goes 30-0 up looking to break.\n\nNovak does not feel the pressure. He wins all the remaining points in the game and holds his serve. Alcaraz is sending a couple of his forehands long but we'll put that down to overzealous excitement.\n\nDjokovic will don a white baseball cap as he switches sides for the second game.\n\nHe attacks aggressively on Alcaraz's second serve - clearly trying to take the game to him.\n\nAlcaraz's forehand looks typically imperious. The power he generates is beggar's belief. He comes to the net with a 30-15 but the veteran is too savvy, and whips the ball cross-court and out of reach.\n\nWe're starting to see some quality rallies early here as Djokovic forces deuce. This feels like experience against energy as Alcaraz's pace and power faces Djokovic's precision and consistency. The quality on display is fantastic.\n\nAlcaraz saves break point and then finally wins the game as Djokovic misdirects a backhand.\n\nA couple of unforced errors to start here from Alcaraz as he sends a straightforward forehand long in the first point, and then another into the net in the third.\n\nDjokovic looks strong as he manipulates the Spaniard around the court and goes 40-0 up. Nevertheless, Alcaraz shows off his youthful speed, reaching an attempted drop-shot with ease and sending it out of reach.\n\nThe Serb converts with a fast serve wide to the right hand side of the court, winning the first game 40-30.\n\nThey'll take a moment to settle in before Djokovic serves the first ball of this match. This is a truly historic moment.\n\nThe first time he competed in the Olympics was in 2008. Alcaraz was five years old at the time...\n\nHe gets a huge reception - he'll prefer that to Wimbledon.\n\nHe receives a warm welcome for the crowd in Roland-Garros today.\n\nThe youngest versus the oldest at these Olympics.\n\nThe best two tennis players in the world are about to take the court.\n\nAs Nadal comes close to hanging up his racket, and Federer is already a distant memory, father time has finally come for Britain's darling.\n\nCompeting in the doubles after a defiant display at Wimbledon earlier this summer, Andy Murray teamed up with Dan Evans in an effort to do the impossible and compete for one last medal.\n\nThey managed to conjure up not one but two great escapes showing off that relentless desire to win at all costs.\n\nFirst it was Japan and then Belgium in a super tie-break comeback which was something out of a child's imagination.\n\nAs they don't play deciding sets in the Olympics it came down to a first-to-ten but win-by-two scenario it was all the more intense. But when Evans smashed it straight into the ground to win the game the euphoria was overwhelming.\n\nThey celebrated like they had won it all. And to us, they had.\n\nThe road had to end somewhere and sadly it was the two Americans, Fritz and Paul, who stood in the way.\n\nThey were outmatched and ultimately overcome, but it was a tournament to remember and a sensational way to wrap up a legendary career.\n\nDjokovic is in a red shirt with white shorts whilst Alcaraz dons yellow shorts and a red top.\n\nBoth look loose and calm at this stage.\n\nIt's easy to make comparisons between the two. It sometimes seems Alcaraz is following Nadal's script.\n\nBoth young Spanish stars burst onto the scene and audaciously started winning right away. They both made taking down legends their wheelhouse speciality.\n\nIf we are witnessing the reemergence of a Nadal-esque talent we could well be in for a long road of dominance and titles. I've already seen enough to think he could surpass him - a tall order but one that Alcaraz is fully capable of fulfilling\n\nBut instead of standing one up against the other, these Olympics gave us the gift of seeing them compete together for their country.\n\nAnd it was glorious. They beat Argentinian duo Molteni and Gonzalez in two close sets before taking on and defeating the Dutch pair Griekspoor and Koolhof in the super tie-break.\n\nAs all good things do, it came to an end in the quarter-finals when the Americans, Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek, asserted their superiority in spite of the 15,000 disappointed fans who were staunchly behind the Spanish team.\n\nI think that will be Nadal's legacy. A player nobody ever wanted to see lose because to see him play for just one more point was worth it. Alcaraz will no doubt carry the mantle and adhere to his predecessor's example.\n\n...this is Djokovic's first Olympic finals!\n\nThe Serb has lost his last three semi-finals at the Olympics, only winning bronze once. Can he finally get that gold medal he has so relentlessly coveted.\n\nThis was one of tennis's longest and most spectacular rivalries which has never failed to entertain. Two true legends who always knew how to perform and played tennis the right way.\n\n60 contests, Djokovic leading 31-29, there really isn't much separating them. Nadal was always the king of the clay but Djokovic ruled the grass - and for a while pretty much everything else.\n\nWhilst there was certainly the usual hype building up for their match, it did feel bittersweet as Nadal looks to be at the back end of his career, no longer the imperious savant we were accustomed to.\n\nThe Spaniard had lost just four times in these hallowed grounds demonstrating just how at home he is here.\n\nNevertheless, Djokovic is not one for long drawn-own goodbyes. He dismantled Nadal 6-1, 6-4, refusing to play with his food. He is on a mission and isn't interested in any niceties.\n\nNadal was valiant, but admitted he doesn't have the legs of his youth.\n\n\"Playing against Novak without creating damage to him, without having the legs of 20 years ago, is almost impossible now,\" he lamented afterwards.\n\nDjokovic had accepted the possibility that this was the so-called 'last dance' between the pair. But Nadal was more defensive when that suggestion was put to him a few days ago. \"Who says it's the last dance?\" he said, with a quizzical raised eyebrow, sending the tennis rumour mill whirring.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz has won all four major finals he has taken part in, including Wimbledon in 2022, and 2024, the US Open in 2022, and the French Open this year.\n\nEarlier this summer he faced Djokovic in the Wimbledon finals, winning in straight sets and displaying a level of dominance over the Serb we have never seen before.\n\nNovak underwent surgery on a torn meniscus just five weeks before the tournament and yet still steamrolled his way through the tournament to reach the finals.\n\nAnd yet, he was totally outclassed. Alcaraz beamed 42 clean winners to Djokovic's 26 and was manipulating him across the court. He was superior in every department and gave up nothing.\n\n\"He played every single shot better than I did,\" acknowledged Djokovic after his 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 defeat. \"He just was better than me in every aspect of the game: in movement, in the way he was striking the ball beautifully, serving great, everything.\"\n\nAsked about the aftermath of his knee surgery, Djokovic said \"That probably had an effect, particularly in the opening rounds. As the tournament progressed, I felt better and better. But yeah, today I was half a step behind him.\"\n\nNovak will need to play at a much higher level if he is to stand a chance in this one.\n\nIn the first of three contests scheduled to be played on Court Phillipe-Chatrier it was the Women's Doubles bronze medal match. The Spanish duo Busca and Sorribes Tormo won 6-2, 6-2, against Czech players Muchova and Noskova in a fairly one-sided affair.\n\nThe Spaniards hit 18 winners and lulled the Czechs into 26 unforced errors with a classy performance. They were impeccable at the net, displaying inhumane reactions and clinical placement.\n\n\"We are speechless,\" said Christina Busca. \"We are crying. This is a dream that has just come true. There are so many people I would like to thank. I am just speechless.\n\n\"After the semi-final I was sure that we would play for the bronze medal and win it.\"\n\nSara Sorribes said, \"It's really incredible what we've achieved to get a bronze medal - it's crazy.\n\n\"After the match we lost I knew we were going to make it.\"\n\nThis is the dream. First seed up against second seed. The two best tennis players in the world. An established legend who refuses to age versus a young champion hungry for more. A rematch of the Wimbledon finals. Are you not entertained?\n\nDjokovic comes into this match having dominated all would-be contenders, including beating Alcaraz's doubles teammate and fading legend Rafael Nadal.\n\nHe began the tournament against Matthew Ebden, dispatching the Australian in straight sets and only dropping a single game. Ebden won gold in the men's doubles yesterday in a tie-break which ended 10-8.\n\nIn the second round, he took on Nadal, again winning in two sets. Djokovic-Nadal at Roland Garros has been one of the great fixtures of modern sport. They've faced each other 60 times, with Djokovic now leading Nadal 31-29. The Spanish stalwart is in the twilight of his career and Djokovic was able to make easy work of this one. Sadly, it's likely to be the last.\n\nAfter beating the German Dominik Koepfer and the Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas respectively, he faced Lorenzo Musetti in the semi-finals.\n\nSpeaking after his victory, the one-time Olympic medalist said, \"It was such a tense match, there were a lot of emotions, so much expectations and stress particularly as a win meant I would secure a medal for my country and it's my first Olympic final. I'm thrilled.\n\n\"I was very nervous before the match because I lost three out of four of my semi-finals in the Olympic Games, so I really wanted to get over this hurdle.\n\n\"I lost quite comfortably to Carlos [Alcaraz] at Wimbledon but this is a different surface and I'm playing better and moving better than I was at Wimbledon, and in a way I have nothing to lose as I already have a medal, so I'm going to go for it.\"\n\nHe faces the stiffest of challenges in his first Olympic finals in Carlos Alcaraz who already holds the past two Wimbledon finals over his head.\n\nAlcaraz has dominated on his way to the finals, juggling playing doubles with Nadal at the same time. He comes into this one the favourite although the last time they faced off at Roland Garros Djokovic came out victorious.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

It was the Serb's first title in 2024. He was coming off meniscus surgery a little more than a month ago.\n\n\"He was already a mythological creature in Serbia and this only adds gold to his resume,\" Mary Carillo said on Peacock.\n\nDjokovic, the all-time men's leader with 24 Grand Slam singles titles, joined an elite club of people who have won all four majors and Olympic gold: Steffi Graf (1988), Andre Agassi (1999), Rafael Nadal (2010) and Serena Williams (2012).\n\nDjokovic's one previous medal was a bronze in 2008 at Beijing after losing to Nadal in the semifinals; Djokovic also was beaten in the semifinals by the eventual champions at London in 2012 (Andy Murray) and at Tokyo three years ago.\n\n\"I played four Olympic games, this is my fifth and I never passed semifinals,\" Djokovic said after his semifinal win over Lorenzo Musetti. \"I lost three out of four semifinals in my first four Olympic games and I managed to overcome this big hurdle.\"\n\nIn a game that took more than 14 minutes and featured several break chances by Alcaraz, Djokovic held for 5-4 in the first.\n\nServing at 5-6, Alcaraz fended off a set point to force a tiebreak.\n\nWith Alcaraz serving at 3-6 in the breaker, he smashed a potential forehand pass winner but Djokovic lunged to stab it back over the net and seize the first set.\n\nThe Serb saved eight break points to win the first set in 1 hour, 32 minutes. When Djokovic left the court for a break, Alcaraz had his head in his hands and had a lengthy conversation with his player box.\n\nIn the second set tiebreak, Djokovic earned an early mini-break for 1-0 and then went up 3-2 with a stretching forehand winner that Alcaraz could not return.\n\nAlcaraz netted a forehand to give Djokovic a 5-2 lead in the breaker. He then hit a two-handed backhand into the net to bring it to 2-6 on his serve.\n\nOn his first match point, Djokovic drilled a forehand winner down the line and then hugged Alcaraz at the net.\n\nDjokovic and Alcaraz had split their six previous career matches, with the Spaniard dominating their most recent match in straight sets in the Wimbledon final last month. They were 1-1 on clay, with Djokovic winning their most recent encounter in the 2023 Roland Garros semifinals when Alcaraz cramped badly and limped to the finish line.\n\nAlcaraz was seeking to become just the second man after his countryman and Olympic doubles partner Rafael Nadal to win the French Open, Wimbledon and Olympic gold in the same year. He had won 12 consecutive matches at Roland Garros dating to the French Open.\n\n\"It's going to be difficult for sure but I will try to be focused on myself,\" Alcaraz said ahead of the match. I try not to hear all the fans, or all the people that say I'm going to win. I'm just going to give my 100%, my best tennis and hopefully I reach my goal to get the gold.\"\n\nDuring his quarterfinal win over Stefanos Tsitsipas, Djokovic twice called the physio for his right knee, the same knee on which he had surgery in early June after withdrawing from Roland Garros. He said he was \"very worried\" about his knee but he rebounded to take out Musetti in straight sets in the semifinals.\n\nAnd then he defeated Alcaraz to win the elusive gold medal.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Carillo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mary Carillo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Tsitsipas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefanos Tsitsipas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66af9614c41a516aacb13eae/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The Serbian star now joins the Golden Slam club: players who have won all four major tournaments: the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open, and an Olympic gold medal. He joins Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams.\n\nWith the second-set tiebreaker at 2-2, Djokovic, 37, unleashed a devastating cross-court winner on a service game from Alcaraz that gave him all the momentum. Alcaraz then made a couple of unforced errors. He looked up in disbelief from the stands after Djokovic's fierce match-point winner. After shaking hands with Alcaraz, he fell to the clay court at Roland Garros and knelt for a moment. Djokovic, overcome with emotion, returned to his bench, put his head in a white towel and wept.\n\nDjokovic has achieved everything you can think of in tennis. But the Olympics does that to you. Representing your country does that to you.\n\nRead more: Which Olympic sport is the toughest on the body?\n\nDjokovic has made no secret of his desire for an Olympic gold medal to cap off his career. He has it now.\n\n\"I didn't know until today that there is an even better feeling, which is winning a gold medal for your country,\" Djokovic said after his victory. \"I couldn't be more proud and happy. Playing for Serbia has always been my biggest, real pleasure, priority.\n\nAt 4-4 in the first set and Djokovic serving, Alcaraz, 21, had several chances to break his opponent. After executing a beautiful drop shot to hold Alcaraz off in that game, Djokovic let out a roar, his most emphatic gesture on court to that point. Djokovic's drop shot was a hit all day. He won that first-set tiebreaker in surprisingly easy fashion.\n\nAll day long, Alcaraz had sauce on his shots. But he couldn't tackle the man who is arguably the best defensive player in tennis history. Djokovic maintained his stamina, even after a handful of points that had him running for his water bottle. Djokovic visibly frustrated Alacaraz, who at one point fired a ball into the net in anger.\n\nThe Spanish flags that flew and hung around Roland Garros outnumbered the Serbian ones. But Djokoic still deserved his fair share of support. No no! the grateful fans in the stands chanted. You could hear cheers for Novak outside Court Philippe-Chatrier during the bronze medal match in the women's doubles. Djokovic will always have his detractors. But his stellar performances towards the end of his career and his friendlier demeanor on court in the last few years have done much to convince the crowd that has been skeptical of his Behavior in the Covid Era and anti-vax stance. Playing in the Olympic tournament that many tennis pros skipped should continue to boost his popularity.\n\nRead more: What Olympic Athletes Eat to Have All That Energy\n\nThe victory comes a few weeks after Alcaraz defeated Djokvic in straight sets in the Wimbledon final. \"I feel like I'm a different player than I was at Wimbledon,\" Djokovic said before the final. \"The way I move, the way I hit the ball. Not to take anything away from the fact that he won the Wimbledon final, he was dominant and deserved a winner, but I feel more confident in myself and my chances in the final.\"\n\nHis self-assessment was quite accurate. Djokovic moved and hit. He proved that he can still win more majors.\n\nAnd he has just taken part in the rare Olympic air.\n\nThis is something else, says Djokovic. This is beyond anything I have ever felt on the tennis court after winning major trophies. It is just an incredible amount of joy.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164614008.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as - no, make that more than - every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier's red clay at the end and why his tears flowed.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,\" said Djokovic, who didn't drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. \"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.\"\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\n\"In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,\" said silver medallist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medallist. \"That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal.

Djokovic beat Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in an enthralling and evenly matched men\u00b4s tennis singles final at the 2024 Games on Sunday.\n\n\"I put my heart, my soul, my body, my family - my everything - on the line to win Olympic gold,\" Djokovic said. \"Incredible battle.

As emotional as ever, he cried and covered his face, then rose and grabbed a red-white-and-blue Serbian flag.\n\nAfter hugs in the stands, Djokovic waved that flag.\n\n\"In the tough moments, he gave it an extra push,\" silver medalist Alcaraz said through his own tears. \"It hurts to lose like this.\"\n\nThe final, which lasted 2 hours, 50 minutes despite being decided in only two sets, was a rematch of the Wimbledon title match three weeks ago that Alcaraz won to follow up his French Open title in June.\n\nSunday\u00b4s contest featured one of the best to ever do it in Djokovic, and the best at the moment in Alcaraz. Indeed, could have been frustrating for Djokovic to find himself once again across the net from a younger, speedier version of himself. Maybe that\u00b4s why Djokovic frequently looked up and gesticulated and muttered toward his guest box.\n\n\"Honestly, when the last shot went through him, past him, that was the only moment I actually thought I can win the match,\" Djokovic said.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d1jcea4y7xhp7l.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Glod.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

He was going to go for it.\"\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him -- and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nUntil getting Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Djokovic said, \"I was ready.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic -- and the \"highest mountain to climb at the moment,\" in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThere was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense. The No. 1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No. 2 Alcaraz saved six. Pressure? Ha. What pressure?\n\n\"We both played at a very high level,\" Djokovic said. \"We really went toe-to-toe.\"\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, Alcaraz -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. As Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters chanted \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\").\n\nYet the place was as quiet as a theater between points; play was delayed briefly when a young child's crying pierced the air that was thick with anticipation.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tiebreaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points, then turned to face his guest box -- which included his tennis team and his wife and their two children -- with a fist held high.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.\n\nWas he worried that moment would never arrive?\n\n\"There are always doubts. Absolutely, I had doubts,\" Djokovic said. \"But the belief and the conviction that I can make it is stronger than my doubts. It always has been. I knew that it's going to happen. It was just a matter of when it's going to happen.\"\n\nSpain's Carlos Alcaraz returns the ball to Serbia's Novak Djokovic during the men's singles tennis final at the Roland Garros stadium during the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, in Paris, France.

I did it for my country first, for Serbia.\"\n\nIn a raucous atmosphere, with soccer-style chants shattering the calm of the adjacent Bois de Boulogne, neither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest.\n\nThe first set alone lasted one hour 33 minutes as the two wrestled for control in a series of spellbinding games, one at 4-4 in which Djokovic repelled five break points.\n\nAlcaraz blinked first in the tiebreak to allow Djokovic to move ahead and when another tiebreak was required to decide the second set, again Djokovic found inspiration, moving 6-2 in front and sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner.\n\nDjokovic roared to the sky and after consoling a crestfallen Alcaraz at the net, then fell to his knees and sobbed into the Parisian clay in the centre of the court before climbing into the crowd where he was swamped by his family, friends and team.\n\nWhile Djokovic became the oldest Olympic singles champion since tennis returned to the Games in 1988, the 21-year-old Alcaraz looked inconsolable after failing to add the gold medal to this year's French Open and Wimbledon crowns.\n\n\"I think I did a really great tournament, I think I did a really great match,\" the four-time Grand Slam champion said. \"Obviously in front of me, I had a really hungry Novak.\"\n\nDjokovic had lost three times in Olympic singles semi-finals with a solitary bronze medal to show from four previous Games.\n\nHe knew Paris was his last realistic chance to fill the remaining space in a bulging trophy cabinet containing 24 Grand Slam titles. And how he earned it -- overturning a crushing loss to Alcaraz three weeks ago in the Wimbledon final to become the first man to win the Olympic singles title without dropping a set.\n\nINCREDIBLE FIGHT\n\nDjokovic joins an elite group of Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams, the latter watching from the front row, in the Golden Slam club, and many will say this settled the G.O.A.T argument once and for all.\n\nIt takes something pretty special to upstage the men's 100 metres final taking place later at the Stade de France, but this near three-hour red-dirt duel arguably came close.\n\nThe opening four games spanned 30 mesmerizing minutes, every rally a battle of skill and wills. Alcaraz saved three break points in the fourth game and looked menacing as he threw everything in his arsenal at Djokovic as the Serb served at 4-4.\n\nSeveral times Djokovic could only smile at the athleticism of his opponent who piled on the pressure to earn five break points, and somehow he survived.\n\nAlcaraz saved a set point at 5-6 but the Spaniard's level dipped in the tiebreak and Djokovic pounced to grab the lead. Sensing his moment, Djokovic's intensity went even higher deep in the second set but Alcaraz hung on.\n\nDjokovic was relentless though and an outrageous forehand winner at 2-2 in the breaker snapped Alcaraz's resistance and the end then came quickly as he claimed the 99th, and perhaps most valuable, title of his glittering career.\n\nA memorable week ended with Italy's Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini beating Russian neutral players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider 2-6 6-1 (10-7) to win the women's gold, adding to compatriot Lorenzo Musetti's men's singles bronze.", "source": {"uri":

That exclusive group also features Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Serena Williams, who was in the stands to witness this pulsating contest.\n\nHow much this triumph meant to Djokovic was immediately evident. Upon winning match point, he roared with delight, dropped to his knees, then tearfully embraced his family and coaching team.\n\nA Serbian flag was soon brought out, and the 37-year-old - the oldest man to win an Olympics singles gold medal - still seemed shaken with joy when he returned to his courtside chair. This is the first title that Djokovic has won all year, but arguably the one he wanted the most.\n\n\"I couldn't be prouder and happier,\" said Djokovic, who won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n\"Playing for Serbia has always been my utmost, real pleasure, my priority ... I'm just so proud to be a part of an elite number of athletes that managed to win gold for their countries in their respective sports.\"\n\nDjokovic celebrates winning match point against Alcaraz.\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nOlympic tennis competitions can be a strange thing, arriving at awkward times in the calendar and often missing some of the sport's top players. This, however, was an exception, a thrilling sequel to Alcaraz's straight-sets victory in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, Djokovic has returned to the court on which he sustained a knee injury while playing at the French Open in June. That seems a lifetime ago now, and one meniscus surgery and one grand slam final later, he has now filled a notable gap in his remarkable trophy cabinet.\n\nStill playing with a brace on his right knee, Djokovic started the match promisingly, creating a break point on Alcaraz's first service game.\n\nThe 21-year-old shut out the opening, which would become a common theme through the early part of the match. Djokovic had five break points in the first set and Alcaraz eight, yet neither man could edge in front.\n\nOr looking at it another way, both seemed to raise their standard when the pressure increased. That was best demonstrated at 2-1 in the first set, with Alcaraz 0-40 down on his own serve. After a quick change of rackets, he reeled off the next three points before wrapping up the game a few points later with an exquisite drop volley.\n\nThe roles reversed several games later. With the set locked at 4-4, Alcaraz's booming forehand heaped the pressure on Djokovic's serve, and the break points came thick and fast - five in that game alone. But the world No. 2 stood firm, roaring to the crowd when a volley winner denied Alcaraz the chance to get ahead.\n\nAlcaraz plays a backhand in the men's singles gold medal match.\n\nMatthew Stockman/Getty Images\n\nIt was fitting and probably fair that this absorbing set would be decided by a tie-break, and with the scores locked at 3-3, it was Alcaraz who cracked first. Back-to-back errors handed Djokovic three set points before another cute forehand volley completed the marathon first set in an hour and 33 minutes.\n\nUnsurprisingly, little changed in the second set, only that break points became fewer and farther between.\n\nAs the match wore on, the standard remained unrelentingly high. At 4-4, Djokovic came from 40-0 down to deuce on Alcaraz serve, prompting chants of \"Nol\u00e9! Nol\u00e9!\" from the stands. But Alcaraz had a response, winning a marathon point by sliding a shot past Djokovic at the net, then raising a finger to his ear in celebration.\n\nAn inevitable tie-break followed soon after and, once again, the 24-time grand slam champion's experience and mettle came to the fore.\n\nA stunning cross-court forehand, bringing to an end one of the longest rallies of the match, had the crowd on their feet, and Djokovic didn't lose a point from there. Another forehand winner completed the victory, which was sealed with a huge roar of delight.\n\nThereafter, the emotions flowed freely as Djokovic kissed and hugged his wife and children in the stands. This was only Serbia's second medal of the Games, and the country's sporting talisman had achieved it without dropping a set in the competition.\n\n\"I was so blessed to win everything pretty much there is to win in my sport, but this is something different,\" said Djokovic. \"This supersedes everything that I've ever felt on the tennis court after winning big trophies. It's just incredible joy.\"\n\nDjokovic had long targeted winning a gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nAmber Searls/USA Today Sports/Reuters\n\nAt 21, Alcaraz had been aiming to become the youngest man to win an Olympic singles gold medal. Despite falling short, he played a wonderful role in this spectacle, dazzling the crowd with 25 forehand winners.\n\nHis unforced error count may have cost him - 33 to Djokovic's 25 - as well as an inferiority to his opponent in the two tie-breaks. But heading into the US swing, the world No. 3 can nonetheless reflect on a stellar two-month period: a first French Open title, a second Wimbledon title and now an Olympic silver medal.\n\n\"I'm really happy about my performance today,\" Alcaraz told reporters. \"I'm a little bit disappointed about not playing my best tennis in some situations, in difficult situations. Tie-breaks, for example, he increased his level at the top and I couldn't do it, so probably a bit sad thinking about those moments.\"\n\nIt just happened to be one of those days that Alcaraz found himself up against an opponent who was inspired and determined like never before.\n\n\"In front of me, I had a really angry Novak,\" he added, \"An impressive player today. His level was really, really high.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_ramsay@cnn.com", "name": "George Ramsay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-08-04t150348z-1220397805-up1ek8415u4av-rtrmadp-3-olympics-2024-tennis.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Back in 2008, he won the bronze medal in Beijing, but a finish on top eluded him. But in Paris, Djokovic made sure of going all the way.

Please try again later.\n\nPARIS -- Novak Djokovic asked more of his 37-year-old body than anyone at Roland Garros could have imagined. He slid on the red clay and grimaced. He watched winners from the bouncier Carlos Alcaraz laser past him and showed frustration that he couldn't move well enough to return them. At times, it hurt just to watch him teeter along with a right knee that had been surgically repaired in this city just two months ago.\n\nStill, sore and achy, Djokovic is more superstar than old man. In adding an Olympic gold medal to his 24 Grand Slam tennis titles, he pulled off one of the most incredible feats of his legendary career Sunday. During the Wimbledon final three weeks ago, Alcaraz, 16 years younger, dusted him in straight sets. But in the men's gold medal match, Djokovic summoned spectacular resolve to outlast Alcaraz in a 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-2) victory that was a test of determination.\n\nThe two-set match was a marathon, lasting two hours and 50 minutes, daring both players to fend off break points and continue to strike the ball well during long rallies. Despite constant threats to break serve, neither player could do so. Alcaraz saved six breaks. Djokovic staved off eight. Anything the match lacked in precision, it made up for in guts. It was splendid competition, every point contested, the kind of willpower you expect when gold is on the line.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nGet the latest updates on the 2024 Olympics\n\n(Washington Post illustration)\n\nTrack all the Paris Olympic medal counts country by country, and see the breakdown of medals by U.S. athletes. Get live updates from Paris and keep up with the latest by signing up for The Sports Moment: Olympics Edition.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nAlcaraz tested Djokovic's movement in every way, executing beautiful drop shots, pressing his opponent from baseline to baseline. Like his serve, Djokovic's body held up.\n\nAt the end, after one final forehand winner, Djokovic spread his arms to the side, turned his palms up and tried to grasp the joy and disbelief. He put his face in his hands and fell to the clay. He crossed himself, kissed his hands and dropped down on the clay once more, resting on all fours for an extended period. Later, he cried and covered his face with a towel. He grabbed the Serbian flag, waved it around the stadium and then went into the stands to hug his loved ones.\n\nOn June 3, Djokovic injured his knee here during the French Open and withdrew from the quarterfinal the next day. On June 5, he was lying in a Paris hospital bed and getting wheeled into the operating room. Yet here he was, eight weeks later, capping a career milestone.\n\n\"When I take everything in consideration, this is probably the biggest sporting success I've ever had in my career,\" Djokovic said.\n\nHe became the fifth player to win a golden slam, which requires titles in all four majors and an Olympic triumph, joining Andre Aggasi, Steffi Graf, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams. He also became the oldest player to win a singles gold medal.\n\nThe men's final pitted the youngest player ever to vie for gold against the oldest. And Djokovic won it wearing a gray knee brace that looked like a Big 5 Sporting Goods deal of the week. Never mind Wimbledon. Leave that 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) loss in the past. Djokovic couldn't keep up on grass one month after a meniscus knee operation. It was remarkable he had played well enough to make the final, but the younger champion beat him so thoroughly it seemed like the torch had been yanked.\n\nBut Djokovic can still grind. He won't be discarded with ease. He didn't turn this tournament into his farewell Olympics, even though it probably is. There is no time to bask in last hurrahs when you remain capable of winning.\n\nAndy Murray, 37, retired at these Games. Rafael Nadal, 38, lost to Djokovic in the second round, leaving us wondering if the rivals will ever meet again in a high-stakes situation. Nevertheless, Djokovic pulled up his knee brace, mitigated the discomfort and taught a junior superstar a lesson.\n\n\"Hungry Novak,\" Alcaraz called him.\n\nplayPlay now\n\nNaN min\n\nFollow on\n\nPodcast episode\n\nSpotify\n\nApple\n\nGoogle\n\nAmazon\n\nAlcaraz expected Djokovic to go all out. But there was no way to prepare for the intensity and purpose that Djokovic played with during key moments.\n\n\"I've heard many, many times that Novak wanted to win a gold medal,\" Alcaraz said. \"I knew that before the match. In the close moments, the difficult situations, the tiebreakers, he played an impressive game. I saw something. He was hungry in the match.\"\n\nUsually, Alcaraz is the one to rise at critical times. His four Grand Slam titles verify his ability to meet the moment. He's only 20 behind Djokovic, and at his first Olympics, Alcaraz hasn't been chasing this final jewel the way his opponent has been.\n\n\"It was a little bit different,\" Alcaraz said of the Olympics. \"In the difficult moments, the tough situations, I increase my level. I felt the pressure in those situations, and I couldn't play my best tennis. I could feel it. I got a lot of experience. I'm going to be a better player.\"\n\nDjokovic needed this one. He played like it. The greater the pressure, the higher he rose. He's always loved representing Serbia. When he was a flag-bearer during the 2012 London Games, he considered it \"the best feeling an athlete can have.\" Now, he has experienced a better one.\n\n\"It kind of supersedes everything I've ever imagined and hoped I could feel,\" Djokovic said.\n\nHe hadn't won a tournament this year, perhaps the most challenging start to a season he has ever had. He wondered if he could turn it around. That's the thing about Djokovic. He's almost never in denial. It frees him to face any challenge.\n\n\"I always have doubts,\" he said. \"My conviction and belief is stronger than the doubt.\"\n\nDuring the medal ceremony, Djokovic lifted his right hand into the air and pointed his index finger toward the heavens. He looked at the gold around his neck, glowing in the daylight. He fulfilled his last big dream.\n\n\"Glory to the gods. Incredible journey,\" he said, while making clear that this is not an ending.\n\nSo, what do you do when you've done it all? A reporter asked Djokovic if he'd \"like to be president of Serbia or something.\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"I am happy with where I am in the moment.\"", "source": {"uri":

He delivered one of the finest performances of his career, becoming only the fifth player in history to win all four Grand Slam titles and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe final was a fierce battle, with neither player yielding an inch. The first set alone lasted an intense one hour and 33 minutes, showcasing a series of spellbinding games. Alcaraz faltered first in the tiebreak, and when another tiebreak decided the second set, Djokovic elevated his game, sealing the victory with a breathtaking forehand winner down the line.\n\nOverwhelmed with emotion, Djokovic roared to the sky, consoled Alcaraz at the net, and then fell to his knees, sobbing at the center of Court Philippe Chatrier. He climbed into the crowd, where he was enveloped by his family, friends, and team. At 37, Djokovic became the oldest player to win the Olympic singles title since tennis returned to the Games in 1988. Meanwhile, the 21-year-old Alcaraz, who had hoped to add an Olympic gold to his French Open and Wimbledon titles, was inconsolable.\n\nHaving lost three times in Olympic singles semi-finals, Djokovic knew this was likely his last chance to fill the final gap in his trophy cabinet, which already boasts a men's record of 24 Grand Slam titles. His victory was made even sweeter by overturning his recent loss to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final, becoming the first man to win the Olympic singles title without dropping a set.\n\n\"It was an incredible fight, and I had to play my best tennis,\" an emotional Djokovic told Eurosport before the medals ceremony, as Serbian fans celebrated in the stands. \"It was fair that the two sets finished in tiebreaks. I put my heart, my soul, everything to win gold.

All-time men's tennis title winner Novak Djokovic of Serbia goes head-to-head with the leader of the new era of tennis, Carlos Alcaraz of Spain.\n\nEven though the pair are both bidding for the same goal - their first Olympic gold medal, they come to the Games in diametrically opposite places in their careers.\n\nAt 21 years old, Alcaraz has already captured four Grand Slam titles, including the French Open trophy in May. Alcaraz burst onto the tennis scene at just 16, and in the ensuing years has postured himself to be the game's next great leading man. Should he win the gold medal, he will become the youngest Olympic singles champion and would join Steffi Graf and Nadal in winning the French, Wimbledon and Olympic titles in the same year.\n\nWhile Djokovic's trophy case is bursting at the seams with accolades a plenty, there is one precious piece of metal that has eluded him throughout his career: an Olympic gold. Some say the Serbian is long overdue. Djokovic has only managed an Olympic best of a bronze in 2008 in his five Games appearances. At 37, Djokovic is the oldest player to reach the Olympic men's singles final since tennis returned to the Games program in 1988. Paris may be his last shot to finally end his medal drought. Should he emerge the victor, Djokovic would complete the \"Golden Slam\" in singles, which is when a player has won all four Grand Slam titles and the gold at the Olympics. To elevate to a \"Golden Slam\" champion would put Djokovic in rarefied air. Only four other tennis players have completed it: Steffi Graff (GER), Andre Agassi (USA), Rafael Nadal (ESP), and Serena Williams (USA).\n\nThe pair are currently split in matchups, but Alcaraz took the win in their last meeting at the men's singles final at Wimbledon, decimating Djokovic in straight sets.\n\nWhile Alcaraz comes to the clay with youth on his side, Djokovic brings with him something even more potent: a champion's final chance for glory.", "source": {"uri": "nbcolympics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nbcolympics.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.nbcolympics.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/ParisDefaultThumbnail.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

I don't play only to win the tournaments.\n\n\"I don't know about the future, I really want to be in the present moment to celebrate. It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal. So now it's about happiness, joy and celebration.\"\n\nIt was played in a superb spirit, with both players often left laughing at the quality of the other's shot-making.\n\nThe crowd was equally split between Spanish fans, decked in flags, and Serbia supporters carrying signs with \"Nole\" - Djokovic's nickname - written on.\n\nAn electric atmosphere added to the tension - Alcaraz looked the more nervous and had to save a break point in his opening game, but he pushed Djokovic to the limit with his mix of touch and power.\n\nHowever, Djokovic simply would not give in. He played some of his best tennis when down break point and, after taking the first set, was full of confidence.\n\nThere was the occasional gesture towards his support box - who responded by telling him to keep his head up and stay positive - but on the whole, Djokovic was as dialled in as he has been all year.\n\nIt has been a difficult season for Djokovic. He lost in the Australian Open semi-finals to Italy's Jannik Sinner, had an indifferent hard court swing, needed knee surgery after injuring himself at Roland Garros and was completely outplayed in his first final of the season at Wimbledon.\n\nHowever, that will only make this victory that much sweeter for a man who shows no sign of stopping - and has not ruled out competing at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.

The highlights included Alcaraz rallying from 0/40 to hold in the fourth game, while Djokovic pulled through a see-saw ninth game, packed with scintillating tennis from both players, having faced five break points.\n\nDjokovic's final break point of the set doubled as a set point at 6-5, 30/40.

Playing on the famous clay courts of Roland Garros, Djokovic was the oldest male finalist in an Olympic tennis tournament and is now the oldest male winner.\n\nHe needed two tiebreaks to do so, but he defeated Alcaraz in straight sets, 7-6(3), 7-6(2). The loss means that Alcaraz, who reached the final as the youngest male finalist in an Olympic tennis tournament, leaves his first participation in the Summer Games with a silver medal.\n\nThe Serb has a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles, but his best performance at the Olympics came in 2008, when he won a bronze medal. His other appearances at the Games have been disappointing, and many saw it as a tough ask to finish with gold this year, given the young talent and Djokovic's own struggles this tennis season.\n\nBut he looked nothing like the injury-plagued 37-year-old who failed to win a Grand Slam this year on Sunday. Facing Alcaraz, a man he had beaten in the final of one of those slams just before the Olympics began, he looked like he was in his No. 1 position.\n\nEarly in the match, Djokovic took advantage of Alcaraz's aggressive play with penalties from difficult angles, his specialty. But while Djokovic threatened a quick break, Alcaraz held off and held out until the start. A few games later, Djokovic had a triple break chance, but this too was dealt with by Alcaraz.\n\nThey went back and forth like that for much of the first set. Djokovic kept hitting shots that looked like Alcaraz had no chance of reaching, but he did so often, bringing the ball back into play. However, both players struggled to get the job done with breaks on the line. No breaks were earned in 13 attempts, leading to a first-set tiebreaker, which Djokovic won.\n\nThe second set was much the same as the first, with both players refusing to break despite several attempts from both sides. Alcaraz made numerous forced errors as he often found Djokovic's strokes but couldn't get his return. They ended with another tiebreak, with Djokovic getting a point on Alcaraz's first serve, which set the tone.\n\nDjokovic and Alcaraz reached the final after defeating their surprise semifinal opponents, Lorenzo Musetti of Italy and Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada. Musetti and Auger-Aliassime were scheduled to face each other for the bronze medal, which ultimately went to Musetti and Italy. He defeated Auger-Aliassime in three sets on Saturday to claim the bronze, leaving Sunday's match between Djokovic and Alcaraz as the only draw.\n\nOn the way to the semi-finals, Djokovic and Alcaraz faced a number of top players, but some very big names were left out. Two of Germany's biggest, Alexander Zverev and Norway's Casper Ruud, both in the top six, lost in the quarter-finals to Musetti and Auger-Aliassime.\n\nIn his quarterfinal, Alcaraz defeated American Tommy Paul in straight sets, ending the US's hopes of a medal in the bracket. Djokovic had a similar straight-sets win over his quarterfinal opponent, eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas. He also faced Rafael Nadal in the second round, defeating the Spaniard in straight sets while both were struggling with injuries.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic had split six career meetings before Sunday's final, including the only two times they've played each other on clay courts. While Djokovic, 37, is unlikely to return to the Olympics for another four years, Alcaraz should have plenty of time to add to his medal tally at age 21.\n\nBelow you will find the full results of the men's singles medal matches.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Tsitsipas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefanos Tsitsipas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ocp3V1FUnwyCZhMYAVkM0nRZW2o=/0x0:7728x4046/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25559044/2164807948.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

At 37 years old, two months after surgery to repair a torn meniscus, Djokovic was clearly hobbling and frequently appeared to be in pain. Carlos Alcaraz, who happens to be the best player in the world, taunted Djokovic with drop shots, forcing him to go where his knee did not want to take him. Alcaraz never lost a service game, and he finished 33 with winners, compared to 15 for Djokovic. What he did not finish with was a gold medal.\n\nDjokovic beat Alcaraz, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-2). Djokovic has always been an expressive player, but there were times in this match when he seemed especially frustrated by forces beyond his control. His problem was not hitting shots; it was getting to them. Djokovic is the best in history at seizing control of a point he seems sure to lose. But in this match, there were balls he would normally track down that he didn't even bother to chase-or when he did, he got there later than we have come to expect.\n\nThis sounds contradictory, but it's true: Djokovic did not look his best, yet he played some of his best tennis. Alcaraz summed it up: \"Hungry Novak ... an impressive player today.\" Someday, when Alcaraz's grandkids ask him what made Djokovic great, this performance at Roland Garros would be a fine place to start.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration,\" Djokovic said afterward, \"this is probably the biggest sporting success I've had in my career.\"\n\nTwo months ago, Djokovic withdrew from the French Open before the quarterfinals because of his knee injury. He seemed unlikely to even play in Wimbledon right up until the tournament started. He made it to the final, where, he said Sunday: \"I was dominated in the final by Alcaraz, who was a far better player.\"\n\nMany players, maybe even most players, would have skipped the Olympics to rest and prepare for the U.S. Open. (Some players did skip this, anyway.) But Djokovic said, \"I did everything I possibly could to prepare myself ... to raise form when it needs to be raised.\n\nDjokovic arrived here having won 10 Australian Opens, seven Wimbledons, four U.S. Opens and three French Opens. He was the most accomplished male player in history. The only person in the world who thought his career was missing anything was him.\n\nDjokovic had never won an Olympic gold medal. He won bronze in Beijing in 2008. He lost in the semifinals in London and Tokyo. He wanted gold desperately, and one reason this match was such great theater is that it was almost certainly his last chance. The other reason was Alcaraz.\n\nAlcaraz is 20 grand slam titles away from catching Djokovic. It is absurd to even discuss the possibility, but it is also irresistible, because Alcaraz is a rare talent. At 21, he has already won four slams, and he has won on all three surfaces.\n\nBoth men said afterward that the pressure of the Olympics was even greater than what they feel at Grand Slams. Djokovic said, \"The fact I lost as easy as I did in the finals at Wimbledon probably worked in my favor because I knew that I couldn't do worse than that.\" With the first set in Paris tied 4-4, Djokovic fended off five break points. In both tiebreakers, Djokovic was the superior player. Alcaraz acknowledged that afterward: \"I felt the pressure in those situations, that I couldn't play my best tennis.\"\n\nWhen the match ended, Djokovic seemed as stunned as he was happy-he ended up prone on the ground, face down, his right hand shaking against the clay. When he got up, he found a towel, sat in his chair and covered his sobbing face.\n\n\"I thought that 2012 opening ceremony, carrying the flag for my country, was the best feeling that an athlete could have,\" the best male tennis player in history said Sunday. \"This supersedes everything that I imagined, and everything I hoped I could experience and feel.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Novak Djokovic Goes From Hobbled to Heroic to Win Elusive Olympic Gold Medal.", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The State"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_rosenberg@thestate.com", "name": "Michael Rosenberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/pmqxqy/picture290741909/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/fef705ac-9de5-4bc6-9e74-e7d256f2c30c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

I put my heart, soul, body, family, everything on the line to win the Olympic Gold at the age of 37.\"\n\nDjokovic had failed four times before and was an underdog in the final today against the red-hot Carlos Alcaraz who had won the last two Slams and just crushed Djokovic at Wimbledon.\n\nRight from the start, though, you could see Djokovic was a different player than London. Moving better, hitting hard and looking more at ease. Early on, the points were long, the games were long. Both players missed buckets of break chances -- Alcaraz 0-for-8 and Djokovic 0-for-5.\n\nThe two played to a breaker like they had to finish Wimbledon. This time Djokovic got out on top.\n\nAfter the 93-minute or so opening stanza, the second moved slight quicker. Just one break point as both raised their level into the breaker. And Djokovic dominated yet again as Alcaraz couldn't find the court.\n\nDjokovic fell to the court in tears, trembling is delight with a 7-6(3), 7-6(2) win, one of the biggest of his career.\n\n\"We almost played three hours for two sets. It was an incredible battle, incredible fight,\" Djokovic said. \"When the last shot went past him, that was the only moment I actually thought I could win the match. I mean I believed that I could win, but to actually win it, because he keeps on coming back. He keeps on asking me to play my best tennis.\n\n\"I don't know what to say. I'm still in shock, honestly.

I finally did it.\"\n\nDjokovic joins just Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal as men to win Golden Slam. Steffi Graf and Serena Williams did it in the women's game.\n\nDjokovic is the oldest of the bunch and it took him the longest, but he'll take it.\n\nAlcaraz at just 21 was trying to become the youngest to win men's singles gold. He'll have many more chances.\n\n\"It is painful to lose the way that I lost this match,\" Alcaraz said. \"I had my opportunities... I couldn't take them. Novak is playing great, he really settled in his position, in the difficult moments he increased his level, he played unbelievable.\n\n\"I'm really disappointed but honestly, I'm going to leave the court with my head really high.

Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as -- no, make that more than -- every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier's red clay at the end and why his tears flowed.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,\" said Djokovic, who didn't drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. \"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.\"\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\n\"In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,\" said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. \"That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.\"\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him -- and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nUntil getting Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Djokovic said, \"I was ready.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic -- and the \"highest mountain to climb at the moment,\" in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThere was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense. The No. 1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No. 2 Alcaraz saved six. Pressure? Ha. What pressure?\n\n\"We both played at a very high level,\" Djokovic said. \"We really went toe-to-toe.\"\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, Alcaraz -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. As Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters chanted \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\").\n\nYet the place was as quiet as a theater between points; play was delayed briefly when a young child's crying pierced the air that was thick with anticipation.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tiebreaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points, then turned to face his guest box -- which included his tennis team and his wife and their two children -- with a fist held high.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.\n\nWas he worried that moment would never arrive?\n\n\"There are always doubts. Absolutely, I had doubts,\" Djokovic said. \"But the belief and the conviction that I can make it is stronger than my doubts. It always has been. I knew that it's going to happen. It was just a matter of when it's going to happen.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

His gold is the first for Serbia in men's singles tennis.\n\nImmediately after his 7-6(3), 7-6(2) defeat of Alcaraz, 21, an emotional Djokovic dropped to his knees on Roland Garros' clay court.

For this match, he was coming in just under nine weeks after undergoing meniscus surgery on his leg.\n\nThe gold medal was truly the one remaining tennis win that had long evaded Djokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam champion. It also comes after Alcaraz beat him in a five-set thriller at Wimbledon last month.\n\nSpeaking to Eurosport after the match, the athlete said, \"I don't know what to say, I'm still in shock.

A Career Golden Slam is when players win all four Grand Slam and an Olympic singles gold medal. Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams have achieved the feat before Djokovic.\n\nSpeaking at the post match press conference, Djokovic said the feeling of winning an Olympic gold medal was very special. \"This is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had and the most special feeling. I thought carrying the flag at the opening ceremony for my country at the 2012 Olympics was the best feeling an athlete could have until today. Now at the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had,\" the 37-year-old said.\n\nDjokovic, 37-years-old, and Alcaraz, who is just 21, have played many memorable matches in the past but the Olympic final at the Roland Garros would stand out as one of the best duels the duo have engaged in.\n\nAll games across both sets were won serve and neither player giving room, it was imperative that a tie-breaker had to decide the outcome, in both the sets.\n\nThe Serbian player said it was only after the final winning shot that he was sure to have won the match.\n\nAn elated Djokovic was uncontrollable as emotions took over the top seed. He, however, said he now has the Los Angeles Olympics in mind, scheduled to be played four years from now. \"We played for three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match. I want to play in Los Angeles, I enjoy playing for my country in the Olympic Games, in the Davis Cup,\" he added.\n\nAlcaraz, who had to settle for a silver medal, said the pressure of playing for Spain got to him. \"I think I put more pressure on myself because I was playing for Spain, for the Spaniards. I felt that I let the Spanish people down by not winning the gold,\" he said.\n\nThe gold medal match between Djokovic and Alcaraz was a rematch of the past two Wimbledon finals, both won by Alcaraz, including in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hari_kishore@thehansindia.com", "name": "Hari Kishore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/08/05/1468201-novak.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6862745098039216, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he has made clear that simply was not sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets. Now Djokovic is the oldest man to win the singles gold in his sport since 1908 -- and prevented Spain's Alcaraz, who is 21, from becoming the youngest.\n\nWhen the victory was his, when the gold was his, thanks to one last forehand winner, Djokovic turned toward his team in the stands -- sitting in front of his wife and their two children -- and dropped his racket as he knelt on the clay. As emotional as ever, he cried and covered his face, then rose and grabbed a red-white-and-blue Serbian flag. After hugs in the stands, Djokovic waved that flag. Alcaraz wept afterward, too.\n\nThe final, which lasted 2 hours, 50 minutes despite being decided in only two sets, was a rematch of the Wimbledon title match three weeks ago that Alcaraz won to follow up his French Open title in June.\n\nAlcaraz also defeated Djokovic in last year's final at the All England Club, but Djokovic won when they met in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open, the annual clay-court tournament held at Roland Garros, the site used for tennis during these Olympics.\n\nSunday's contest was an enthralling matchup, featuring one of the best to ever do it in Djokovic, and the best at the moment in Alcaraz. Indeed, could have been frustrating for Djokovic to find himself once again across the net from a younger, speedier version of himself. Maybe that's why Djokovic frequently looked up and gesticulated and muttered toward his guest box.\n\nStill, he came out on top.\n\nIt required long exchanges filled with superb ball-striking at the baseline, deft drop shots -- Alcaraz's tended to be more successful, sometimes so good Djokovic declined to even give chase -- and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense at both ends. They served so well that neither got broken even once: Djokovic saved eight break points, Alcaraz six.\n\nMost remarkable, perhaps, was how cleanly both men played, despite the talent of the opposition and pressure of the occasion. Unforced errors were rare.\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, the loser -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Make no mistake, this encounter between the No. 1-seeded Djokovic and No. 2-seeded Alcaraz was worthy of a major final, and no one fortunate enough to hold a ticket could complain about not getting their money's worth.\n\nThose in the stands became part of the show, repeatedly breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. In the second set, as Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters began chanting, \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\") while shaking their red-and-yellow flags. Chair umpire Damien Dumusois occasionally reminded folks to remain silent during the action.\n\nYet it also became as quiet as a theater between points, enough so that play was delayed briefly in the first set when the air thick with anticipation was pierced by a young child's crying.\n\nBoth men played to the crowd. When Alcaraz raced to reach one drop shot and deposit it over the net for a winner, he basked in the raucous reaction by pointing his right index finger to his ear. When Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point to lead 3-2 in the second tiebreaker, he waved both arms overhead to encourage folks who already were on their feet, screaming.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, chock full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes, including five break chances for Alcaraz, before Djokovic managed to hold for a 5-4 lead. In the tiebreaker, Djokovic was superior in crunch time, as he so often is, taking the last four points.\n\nAt 3-all, Alcaraz delivered a body serve, but Djokovic slid just enough to his left to smack a cross-court forehand return winner. After two mistakes by Alcaraz, Djokovic produced a volley winner and turned to face his family with a fist held high.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange

In a repeat of the recent Wimbledon finalthe youngest man who a Olympic final faced the oldest ever: 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz took on 37-year-old Novak Djokovic for the gold medal.\n\nAlcaraz had blown away Djokovic on the grass courts of London just 3 weeks earlier and was also the reigning French Open champion in the battle for the gold medal in Paris. In early June he had defeated Alexander Zverev in a 5-set battle on the Phillipe-Chatrier court.\n\nIt already felt like a farewell tournament, with Andy Murray playing his last professional match and tears shed for Rafael Nadal, who many believe was playing his last match on the court he ruled for most of his career. Many saw the Paris Olympics as Djokovic's last chance to win the coveted gold medal.\n\nIt was the only major honour to elude him during a glittering, record-breaking career and he will be 41 by the time the 2028 Olympics in LA begin. Despite surpassing his great rival Nadal in Grand Slam titles, Djokovic had yet to achieve the so-called career Golden Slam in singles - all four Grand Slams and an Olympic gold medal - something the Spaniard achieved after an Olympic gold medal in Beijing in 2008 and an Australian Open title in 2009 to complete the set.\n\nIn a thrilling men's tennis singles final, Djokovic defeated Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2).\n\nDjokovic entered the final with minor injury concerns, claiming that a knee injury he had surgery on in June had troubled him throughout the Olympic tournament. But even when he wasn't 100 percent, the Serb reached the gold medal match without dropping a set, just like Alcaraz.\n\nHowever, the Spaniard spent much more time on court, reaching the quarter-finals of the men's doubles in a box-office pairing with Nadal, while Djokovic opted to compete in the singles tournament only this time around.\n\nDespite being the reigning Grand Slam champion on this court, Alcaraz started tentatively, fending off a break point in his first service game and coming back from 0-40 down in his second to impressively level the first set at 2-2. Little could separate the two men as they continued to hold serve, but it was Alcaraz who had the better of the chances, with eight break point chances passing him by before Djokovic showed his championship credentials to pull away in the first set tiebreak to take the set.\n\nThe atmosphere in Phillipe-Chatrier was as electric as the level of tennis. As the Serbian walked back to his bench, cheering, the brass band on the court came to life, adding to the excitement in the crowd.\n\nThe second set followed a similar pattern, with both men holding serve, but it was Djokovic who looked to be the man in control. Alcaraz began to make uncharacteristic unforced errors and with every Djokovic winner the crowd celebrated, the Serb's level seemed to rise and he looked to be the man with the momentum as they headed into a second set tiebreak.\n\nDjokovic took a brief break early in the tiebreaker with an incredible forehand cross-court winner that had the crowd on their feet and they could barely sit down afterward. The Serb steamrolled through the tiebreaker to the gold medal and complete the career gold slam that had eluded him for so long.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion is now an Olympic champion on his fifth attempt. He joins an exclusive group of Nadal, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graff and Serena Williams as Golden Slam winners and as he sobbed and held a Serbian flag aloft in the middle of the court, some would argue that this gold medal earns him the undisputed title of greatest player of all time.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

However, his hopes were dashed by the experienced Djokovic, who came out on top in the much-awaited contest.\n\nAlcaraz was considered the favourite heading into the gold medal match at his debut Olympic campaign having won the French Open and Wimbledon titles earlier this year. The Spanish ace had defeated Djokovic in a lop-sided final at Wimbledon to stop the 37-year-old from winning his 25th Grand Slam title.\n\nHowever, on Sunday as both superstars battled for their maiden Olympic gold medal, it was Djokovic who reigned supreme. The Serbian defeated Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6(2) in an intense contest that lasted two hours and 52 minutes. The gold medal triumph at the Paris Olympics saw Djokovic become only the 5th player in history to complete a Career Golden Slam in singles.\n\nIt was agony on the other side as Alcaraz was clearly dejected after his defeat. The 21-year-old was seen breaking down uncontrollably as tears rolled down his cheeks during a TV interview after his loss against Djokovic. The video of Alcaraz crying after the loss left his fans heartbroken.\n\nOpening up on his emotional breakdown after his loss in the final, Alcaraz said he felt he let the Spanish people down with his defeat as they had high expectations from him.\n\n\"I feel that I let the Spanish people down.

With the name Djokovic echoing around the stadium, the Serbian climbed the stairs and went into the stands to celebrate with his family. After Djokovic's 7-6, 7-6 win in the gold medal match, the emotions got the better of Alcaraz as he settled for the silver medal.\n\nNow after this win, he has won 24 Grand Slam titles, the most by anyone across both men's and women's tennis. Djokovic has won 10 Australian Open titles, three French Open titles, seven Wimbledon titles and four US Open titles.\n\nBesides all this, he now finally has an Olympic gold medal, which is required for a player to complete a career golden slam.\n\nAside from his dominance at Grand Slam level, Djokovic has a total of 72 big titles in tennis. After spending years trying to catch up with stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he has outshined them to become the leader of the modern-day 'Big Three' in tennis. This includes 40 ATP Masters titles as well and seven ATP Finals championship titles.\n\nNadal is second among the 'Big Three', with a total of 59 big titles, including 22 Grand Slams, which also includes a record 14 French Open titles, 36 ATP Masters titles and one Olympic gold medal in singles competition.\n\nFederer is at number three, with 20 Grand Slam titles, including a record eight Wimbledon titles, 28 ATP Masters titles and six ATP Finals titles. This all combines and makes 54 big titles. He has no Olympic singles gold medal though, having one silver medal in the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBesides Djokovic, no other player has won an Olympic singles gold, Grand Slams and all nine ATP Masters 1000 titles.\n\nNotably, Djokovic won all four grand slams in 2021 but failed to touch the rare feat of winning all four grand slams as well as the Olympic gold. Fast forward three years later, the Serbian legend finally has his hands on the elusive gold.\n\nThe blockbuster gold medal clash had its fair share of highlights, with Alcaraz flaunting his ace and Djokovic shinning with his precision.\n\nIn a neck-to-neck battle, Djokovic sealed the first game and stood inches away from breaking Alcaraz's serve.\n\nThroughout the first set, fierce rallies unfolded with Alcaraz, quick as lightning, pulling off slapshots backhand and forehand shots from his arsenal. Djokovic relied on using the court to his advantage and negating the threat that Alacaraz carried.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic stood steps away from breaking each other's serve numerous times. Eventually, Djokovic managed to take away Alcaraz's advantage during the breakpoint and smiled. Each time Alcaraz denied the Serbian to go ahead in the game, the Spaniard was more aggressive and animated in his reaction.\n\nWith the first set level at 6-6, the game went into a tiebreak. Djokovic took the first point after Alcaraz's attempt to slice a forehand shot went wide.\n\nThe Spaniard fought back to take the next point. The duo seemed inseparable until Djokovic upped the ante to take four consecutive points to seal the first set in his favour.\n\nIn the second set, the uncanny resemblance to the opening set continued to keep the packed audience in a state of trance.\n\nDjokovic ensured that Alcaraz had no room to get close to the net and take control of their intense rallies. The second set featured some delightful rallies, forcing the fans to stand on their feet and appreciate the spectacle that the two produced. Drop shot was a common theme throughout those rallies, which was used by both tennis stars to overcome each other.\n\nWith the second set, going right down the wire at 6-6, Alcaraz needed to take the second set home to keep his hopes of standing at the top of the podium alive.\n\nDjokovic raced to a 2-0 lead but Alcaraz fought back to level the scoreline. Djokovic relied on his strong forehand play to turn his dream into reality and win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe heartbreak that Djokovic suffered in the Wimbledon final last month at the hands of Alcaraz became a distant memory.

Now, the Serb has added another feather to his cap. AP\n\nSerbia's Novak Djokovic added another feather to his cap after he defeated Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets in the men's singles final of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Sunday. Djokovic defeated Alcaraz 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-2) to win his maiden Olympic gold medal. This was his last major achievement that had been missing from his trophy cabinet that consists of 24 Grand Slam trophies.\n\nIn his stellar career, Djokovic has also spent most weeks spent at No. 1 in the rankings by any man or woman. It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze \u00e2\u20ac\" and he has made clear that simply was not sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets. Now Djokovic is the oldest man to win the singles gold in his sport since 1908 \u00e2\u20ac\" and prevented Spain's Alcaraz, who is 21, from becoming the youngest.\n\nWhen the victory was his, when the gold was his, thanks to one last forehand winner, Djokovic turned toward his team in the stands \u00e2\u20ac\" sitting in front of his wife and their two children \u00e2\u20ac\" and dropped his racket as he knelt on the clay. As emotional as ever, he cried and covered his face, then rose and grabbed a red-white-and-blue Serbian flag. After hugs in the stands, Djokovic waved that flag. Alcaraz wept afterward, too.\n\nThe final, which lasted 2 hours, 50 minutes despite being decided in only two sets, was a rematch of the Wimbledon title match three weeks ago that Alcaraz won to follow up his French Open title in June.\n\nAlcaraz also defeated Djokovic in last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final at the All England Club, but Djokovic won when they met in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open, the annual clay-court tournament held at Roland Garros, the site used for tennis during these Olympics.\n\nSunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contest was an enthralling matchup, featuring one of the best to ever do it in Djokovic, and the best at the moment in Alcaraz. Indeed, could have been frustrating for Djokovic to find himself once again across the net from a younger, speedier version of himself. Maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Djokovic frequently looked up and gesticulated and muttered toward his guest box.\n\nStill, he came out on top. It required long exchanges filled with superb ball-striking at the baseline, deft drop shots \u00e2\u20ac\" Alcaraz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tended to be more successful, sometimes so good Djokovic declined to even give chase \u00e2\u20ac\" and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense at both ends.\n\nThey served so well that neither got broken even once: Djokovic saved eight break points, Alcaraz six. Most remarkable, perhaps, was how cleanly both men played, despite the talent of the opposition and pressure of the occasion. Unforced errors were rare.\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans \u00e2\u20ac\" and, naturally, the loser \u00e2\u20ac\" was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Make no mistake, this encounter between the No. 1-seeded Djokovic and No. 2-seeded Alcaraz was worthy of a major final, and no one fortunate enough to hold a ticket could complain about not getting their money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth.\n\nThose in the stands became part of the show, repeatedly breaking out into choruses of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No-le! No-le!\u00e2\u20ac or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Car-los! Car-los!\u00e2\u20ac that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. In the second set, as Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters began chanting, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Si, se puede!\u00e2\u20ac (essentially, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, you can!\u00e2\u20ac) while shaking their red-and-yellow flags. Chair umpire Damien Dumusois occasionally reminded folks to remain silent during the action.\n\nYet it also became as quiet as a theater between points, enough so that play was delayed briefly in the first set when the air thick with anticipation was pierced by a young child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crying.\n\nBoth men played to the crowd. When Alcaraz raced to reach one drop shot and deposit it over the net for a winner, he basked in the raucous reaction by pointing his right index finger to his ear. When Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point to lead 3-2 in the second tiebreaker, he waved both arms overhead to encourage folks who already were on their feet, screaming.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, chock full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes, including five break chances for Alcaraz, before Djokovic managed to hold for a 5-4 lead. In the tiebreaker, Djokovic was superior in crunch time, as he so often is, taking the last four points.\n\nAt 3-all, Alcaraz delivered a body serve, but Djokovic slid just enough to his left to smack a cross-court forehand return winner. After two mistakes by Alcaraz, Djokovic produced a volley winner and turned to face his family with a fist held high.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"},

With the name Djokovic echoing around the stadium, the Serbian climbed the stairs and went into the stands to celebrate with his family. After Djokovic's 7-6, 7-6 win in the gold medal match, the emotions got the better of Alcaraz as he settled for the silver medal.\n\nNow after this win, he has won 24 Grand Slam titles, the most by anyone across both men's and women's tennis. Djokovic has won 10 Australian Open titles, three French Open titles, seven Wimbledon titles and four US Open titles.\n\nBesides all this, he now finally has an Olympic gold medal, which is required for a player to complete a career golden slam.\n\nAside from his dominance at Grand Slam level, Djokovic has a total of 72 big titles in tennis. After spending years trying to catch up with stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he has outshined them to become the leader of the modern-day 'Big Three' in tennis. This includes 40 ATP Masters titles as well as seven ATP Finals championship titles.\n\nNadal is second among the 'Big Three', with a total of 59 big titles, including 22 Grand Slams, which also includes a record 14 French Open titles, 36 ATP Masters titles and one Olympic gold medal in singles competition. Federer is at number three, with 20 Grand Slam titles, including a record eight Wimbledon titles, 28 ATP Masters titles and six ATP Finals titles. This all combines and makes 54 big titles. He has no Olympic singles gold medal though, having one silver medal in the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBesides Djokovic, no other player has won an Olympic singles gold, Grand Slams and all nine ATP Masters 1000 titles.\n\nNotably, Djokovic won all four grand slams in 2021 but failed to touch the rare feat of winning all four grand slams as well as the Olympic gold. Fast forward three years later, the Serbian legend finally has his hands on the elusive gold.\n\nThe blockbuster gold medal clash had its fair share of highlights, with Alcaraz flaunting his ace and Djokovic shinning with his precision.\n\nIn a neck-to-neck battle, Djokovic sealed the first game and stood inches away from breaking Alcaraz's serve.\n\nThroughout the first set, fierce rallies unfolded with Alcaraz, quick as lightning, pulling off slapshots backhand and forehand shots from his arsenal. Djokovic relied on using the court to his advantage and negating the threat that Alacaraz carried.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic stood steps away from breaking each other's serve numerous times. Eventually, Djokovic managed to take away Alcaraz's advantage during the breakpoint and smiled. Each time Alcaraz denied the Serbian to go ahead in the game, the Spaniard was more aggressive and animated in his reaction.\n\nWith the first set level at 6-6, the game went into a tiebreak. Djokovic took the first point after Alcaraz's attempt to slice a forehand shot went wide. The Spaniard fought back to take the next point. The duo seemed inseparable until Djokovic upped the ante to take four consecutive points to seal the first set in his favour.\n\nIn the second set, the uncanny resemblance to the opening set continued to keep the packed audience in a state of trance.\n\nDjokovic ensured that Alcaraz had no room to get close to the net and take control of their intense rallies. The second set featured some delightful rallies, forcing the fans to stand on their feet and appreciate the spectacle that the two produced. Drop shot was a common theme throughout those rallies, which was used by both tennis stars to overcome each other.\n\nWith the second set, going right down the wire at 6-6, Alcaraz needed to take the second set home to keep his hopes of standing at the top of the podium alive.\n\nDjokovic raced to a 2-0 lead but Alcaraz fought back to level the scoreline. Djokovic relied on his strong forehand play to turn his dream into reality and win his first Olympic gold medal. The heartbreak that Djokovic suffered in the Wimbledon final last month at the hands of Alcaraz became a distant memory.", "source": {"uri": "newsroompost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsroomPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Three (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ace (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://newsroompost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/picture-3-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

After all, if there was one tennis match Djokovic could have picked to win at the start of the year, it wouldn't have been the Wimbledon final.\n\nJust 21 days later, an inspired Djokovic earned revenge and ended his long quest for a first Olympic gold medal, defeating Alcaraz 7-6 (3) 7-6 (2) in an all-time final at Roland Garros.\n\nAt 37 and at his fifth Olympics, Djokovic captured the one title that had far so long evaded him to complete the career golden slam. Two months after tearing his meniscus in his right knee and appearing to be a doubt for the Olympics when he underwent surgery, Djokovic returned to the same court on Philippe-Chatier to record one of the greatest victories of his career against his young rival, delivering a gold medal for Serbia that will rank highly among his record 24 grand slam titles.\n\nIn doing so, he managed to suppress Alcaraz just as the Spaniard was appearing to be a level above what Djokovic was able to produce at this stage of his career. Djokovic dug deep into his reserves, first denying and then outlasting Alcaraz in an titanic 93-minute opening set. Djokovic withstood Alcaraz's powers of athleticism and shot-making in an epic last stand that displayed a vintage look at his greatest qualities as a tennis player. Djokovic endured, remaining solid in all aspects of his game, and delivered when the biggest moments arrived to claim a historic victory in one of the most memorable Olympics finals ever staged.\n\nAnd with 10 Australian Opens, three French Opens, seven Wimbledon, four US Opens, seven ATP Finals, 40 ATP 1000 titles, Djokovic now has the Olympic gold to tick the final box that was missing in his career. By becoming just the fifth player to complete the career grand slam in singles, he joins Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi, Serena Williams and Steffi Graf to claim another major milestone. Djokovic needed to be at his very best to beat Alcaraz and with history on the line, but found a level that had looked beyond him for much of the season. Incredibly, Djokovic also ends an eight-month title drought.\n\nA monumental final brought the rawest emotions: there weren't many new feelings in the sport for Djokovic to experience but winning gold for his country was one. First there was shock, as he dropped his racket and turned to his box, eyes wide. Then came the tears, as Djokovic dropped to the clay and looked to the sky, shaking through sobs. At the far end of the court, Alcaraz was unable to speak as he was interviewed on TV, turning away to cover his face. He will have many more chances. Djokovic, who will be 41 by the time of the next Olympics in Los Angeles, knew this was it, adding another layer to a legendary performance.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/4f1a8547ac015ffbf997ef0de05e44d0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The only empty space in his trophy cabinet - the one waiting for an Olympic gold medal - has now been filled, after a phenomenal near-three hour battle with his young rival Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nThere were no breaks of serve in this 7-6, 7-6 victory, but the quality of tennis and drama reached rare heights, particularly when Alcaraz made a strong push towards the end of the first set.\n\nDjokovic was on the back foot against a more explosive opponent, but he fell back on his courtcraft. Even when his shots weren't as good as Alcaraz's, his decison-making was far sharper, and his nerve held strong on the biggest points.\n\nHe was visibly emotional after claiming a prize he had been seeking since he took bronze in the Olympic singles event of 2008. After clinching victory with a forehand winner, he knelt down on the court for an extended moment, and then pulled a Serbian flag out of his bag and roared as waved it to his fans.\n\nAlcaraz was emotional as well, breaking down in tears as he gave a post-match interview at the side of the court. Seldom has a man played as well in defeat as Alcaraz did here, striking more than 40 clean winners in just two sets. But Alcaraz is 21 and his time will come again.\n\nThanks for tuning in for one of the greatest tennis match's in Olympics history, and the sport in general. There was so little separating these two and yet somehow, some way, Djokovic tapped into that otherworldly instinct and finally got his gold. You could see just how much it meant to him.\n\nAlcaraz is very emotional, now in tears and unable to give his interview. He gave everything here and lost by such a fine margin.\n\nDjokovic is sobbing uncontrollably on his bench here. He finally gets up to hoist the Serbian flag aloft and goes to celebrate with his family. What an incredible moment.\n\nHe's done it! Djokovic is in tears, broken on the court. He's only the fifth player to win it all. Djokovic has shown why he is the greatest to ever play the game.\n\nAnother one into the net and Djokovic will have 4 points to earn him that elusive gold medal. You've got to feel for Alcaraz here as he breaks at the crucial moment.\n\nAn unforced error from Alcaraz and that could be it. He was in a good position and nevertheless hit it too low into the net. Djokovic is in the driver's seat here.\n\nWhat a forehand from Djokovic which sends Alcaraz sliding again. He somehow gets something on it this time, but it's only enough to gift Djokovic the easy smash.\n\nWow! One of the best shots of the match. Djokovic again battling on the back foot but somehow manages to hit a missile of a forehand which Alcaraz at full stretch can't get anything on.\n\nThe crowd can hardly contain itself as the umpire is forced again to try helplessly to intervene.\n\nAlcaraz's serve is massive, forcing Djokovic to stretch and scream, setting him up for an easy winner\n\nAnother long rally and this time it's Alcaraz who comes out on top. Djokovic hits a forehand inches long and the Spaniard is back in it.\n\nSome shouts from the crowd delays Djokovic here. The crowd claps but Novak is less than amused.\n\nDjokovic on the defensive somehow survives an onslaught from Alcaraz, returning some absolute rockets and somehow reposturing to win the point. This is one of the all-time great performances from Djokovic.\n\nAlcaraz serves first but it's Djokovic who draws first blood, hitting a gorgeous forehand cross-court and out of reach.\n\nDjokovic has come to the net here to dispute the umpire's call. He's convinced the serve was in and that the umpire was looking at the wrong ball. Both seem unlikely to yield, but Alcaraz breaks the tension and gives the Serb his first serve back. He's thanked by a thumbs up from his opposition.\n\nDjokovic is playing his service games at such a high level. He serves hard, sets up his shot, and then executes. It's cold and clinical, each point more incisive than the next. 40-0.\n\nDjokovic win's the game and we're going into yet another tiebreak. I think anyone could have predicted this - there almost nothing separating these super-athletes\n\nDjokovic has saved eight break points up until this stage. Alcaraz has saved six. Somehow, we are yet to have a single break as we watch two of the world's greatest returners refuse to give their opposition an inch.\n\nAlcaraz swiftly builds up a 40-0 lead in this game. He makes no mistake, refusing to allow Djokovic to mount another tricky comeback and taking the lead in the set.\n\nAlcaraz is starting to establish himself in Djokovic's service games now, but Djokovic will not give anything up. He predicts the drop-shot, and times his run perfectly, giving himself time to place his return out of Alcaraz's reach and go up 30-15.\n\nAlcaraz hits a gorgeous backhand down the line which lands right in the back corner, saving himself game point at 40-30.\n\nIt's clear to see why they call him a machine. This performance has been masterful and without hitches. Djokovic forces Alcaraz out wide to his right, stretching to return it high and too long.\n\nWhat a fantastic point! Djokovic scrambles all over the court as Alcaraz drops and then lobs and somehow he continues to return. Finally Alacaraz puts the point to bed. Both have had some ridiculous defensive points taking every single one intensley personally.\n\nThat one took a lot of of Djokovic, who drops the next two points with some unforced errors.\n\nHe's back in it though, giving Alcaraz a chance to run. He's battled his way back to 30-40 in this pivotal game.\n\nA gorgeous drop-shot from Djokovic is met by Alcaraz who can only tip it over. The Serb thinks it was a double bounce but makes sure by blasting it past Alcaraz and saving his third game point in a row.\n\nAt deuce here and the bludgeoning continues. Back and forth some huge shots and gobble dup like they're nothing. Alcaraz finally blinks first and slices one short, forcing Djokovic to bend and lean. He smashes the return in style and goes 40-AD up.\n\nAvoiding disaster, Alcaraz plays the final point of the game beautifully, setting himself up to smash and roar to the adoring crowd.\n\nBoth players frustrated with the crowd here with the umpire having to warn them again at the request of Djokovic.\n\nDjokovic has only dropped one point on his serve thus far in this set, winning the first point quickly and decisively.\n\nAnother miraculous defensive point from Alcaraz who returns one far out to his left-hand side. Djokovic lines up to crack one down the line but the net had other ideas and clipped it wide - 15-15.\n\nAlcaraz has stepped it up here and its his turn to send Djokovic scampering wide after a stunning forehand cross-court. He somehow returns, but Alcaraz finishes.\n\nBack the other way now and Alcaraz growls at his team having given up an easy one.\n\nThis has been his toughest service game by far here as he goes up AD-40. Djokovic continues to wrongfoot the young Spaniard as he plays smarter and smarter. Both players are playing such a high difficulty level of tennis.\n\nDjokovic wins the game - are we going to see a break today?\n\nDjokovic is incensed with his team here as he drops the game to Alcaraz without much resistance.\n\nThat was much better from Carlos who made no mistakes.\n\nWhat a start to this game! A rally goes on and on before Djokovic goes for the kill with a drop shot. Alcaraz uses his pace to make up the ground before feinting a cross-court shot and hitting down the line. Gorgeous tennis.\n\nIt's Djokovic's turn to get frustrated as on the next point he hits long and belts out an expletive. 15-15.\n\nThat seems to have fired him up as he hits his first ace of the game to the dismay of Alcaraz who can only watch.\n\nAnother ridiculous rally favours Djokovic at 40-15 as the Serb somehow manages to defend some brutal strokes sending his return high and long. Alcaraz is too nonchalant, not smashing with enough pace and allowing Djokovic back into the point before hitting into the net.\n\nDjokovic takes the game.\n\nDjokovic's face tells all. Eyes wide open in a steely grimace. He wants this.\n\nAlcaraz hits another drop-shot which Djokovic meets, using the angle on his return. Somehow Alcaraz gets there and hooks it round, turning a tight angle into an impossible one and winning the point.\n\nAnother long and brutal rally ends in Alcaraz's favour as he lets out an almighty bellow on a forehand crusher down the line.\n\nA gorgeous backhand down the line form Djokovic at game-point forces Alcaraz to loop a forehand long. This is incredible tennis from the veteran who is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nNevertheless, Alcaraz does not relent, holding firm with some fantastic serving and refusing to be broken.\n\nA fantastic rally at 15-0 as both athletes send bludgeoning strikes across the net. Eventually the tension breaks as Alacaraz's forehand creeps out.\n\nA couple more misses from Alcaraz and Djokovic wins the game.\n\nThe frustration is setting in as Alcaraz waves his arms following a scuffed forehand. The crowd are getting behind him but he can't afford any more unforced errors like that as Djokovic postures.\n\nHe responds gloriously hitting a forehand to the far right-hand corner of the court with incredible precision, saving the break. Alcaraz then gets Djokovic running with a firm forehand down the line before putting it on the other side of the court.\n\nHe wins the game and roars like he's won the set. He needed that one.\n\nAlcaraz has made an adjustment in his serve return, positioning himself closer and more central on the baseline. Djokovic responds in kind, serving shorter to counter the counter, and it works.\n\nDjokovic goes up 30-0 with the Serbian contingent of the crowd roaring in support. The precision on his forehand winners are unbelievable.\n\nHe looks relaxed and confident here. Alcaraz bounces into a blasted forehand down the line, but Djokovic gives him the eyes and wrongfoots the Spaniard, sending it back from whence it came and holding his serve without dropping a point.\n\nAlcaraz is fired up here, eager to get himself back into rhythm quickly. He comes out firing and goes 40-0 up immediately.\n\nDjokovic stumbles when Alcaraz sends a shot destined to wrongfoot him - unluckily for the Spaniard it can't get over the net. Djokovic seems to enjoy making things harder for himself as he battles his way to deuce.\n\nAlcaraz hits an audacious forehand volley drop-shot, which, despite running for it, Djokovic simply can't reach.\n\nDjokovic refuses to die but Alcaraz's furious power gives sends him 40-AD up for the second time this game. Finally, Djokovic sends his backhand long and the game relents. Unsurprisingly, the intensity has not dropped from either player here.\n\nThat was an hour and thirty-three minutes of pure tennis brilliance. Alcaraz has won three of his matches quicker than that first set. Amazing stuff and we're about to get going for the second already!\n\nDjokivic wins the set! Alcaraz hits a drop shot that he's clearly unhappy with and visibly resigns before Djokovic can even reach it. Novak hits down the line, but Alcaraz snaps into action swinging a forehand cros-scourt. Somehow, Djokovic reaches it and volleys into the empty court.\n\nWhat an intense and tight set there. Both players refused to give up ground and Djokovic edged it purely on execution right at the end.\n\nDjokovic's serve is wide and out of reach of the young Spaniard and you can see the frustration set in. He has to visibly hold himself back from smashing his racket into the ground.\n\nThis could be the moment for Djokovic here as he takes a two-point lead.\n\nWhat a serve return from Djokovic who uses the momentum to crash the ball into the service box and away from Alcaraz's reach.\n\nAlcaraz's serve is too strong and Djokovic can't return. Again, we are level.\n\nA fantastic forehand from the left-hand side of the court from Djokovic sets up an easy volleyed return to a gaping hole on the other side of the court.\n\nThis time the backhand is a tad long from Alcaraz. There is nothing to separate these two.\n\nAlcaraz takes the lead with a crushing backhand.\n\nDjokovic wins the first point of the tiebreak after a nice rally but Alcaraz comes storming back in the second point. He launches a brutal forehand down the line which nobody could reach.\n\nDjokovic goes 0-15 up as he looks to steal this set. So far there's been almost nothing separating the two here but Novak senses blood in the water. He advances aggressively, hitting a crosscourt backhand low and true as he approaches mid-court. Alcaraz isn't having any of it though, and returns down the line and out of reach, earning a clap from Djokovic who knows he's been bested there.\n\nAlcaraz follows that up with another forehand slice which Djokovic, at 37 years old, has no intention of wasting his energy on. 30-15 Alcaraz.\n\nA nice rally gives Alcaraz an opportunity to volley into a gaping right-hand side of the court. Somehow he gets it wrong, dropping it into the net and given Djokovic set point.\n\nOf course, he's not doen there though, hitting a gorgeous sweeping forehand out of reach of the stretching Serb. Deuce.\n\nAlcaraz gets a couple of serves right and we're into the tiebreak. This set deserved it.\n\nThe crowd liked that one. Alcaraz rocks back, shaping up for a huge forehand and then cuts through the ball, placing the perfect drop-shot.\n\nDjokovic hesitates a couple of times before his serve as the silenced is pierced by the sound of a baby crying. No doubt as a father of young children that noise has become a daily battle for him. When he does finally get his serve off it's inch pefect and sets up an easy winner following Alcaraz's stretched return - clearly not too distracted.\n\n40-30 up, Djokovic has to sprint to reach one of Alcaraz's torturous short slices. He manages to return this one, and the Spaniard's lob is long, giving Novak the game. He'll have a tie-break at the least.\n\nDjokovic is livid here as he commits an unforced error at the end of a long rally - he knows he can't afford to give up anything easy here.\n\nThere is no such thing as a drop-shot to Alcaraz. Djokovic continues to test him, but the Spaniard is meeting everything at the net. Nevertheless, he sends this one too wide as he tries to give Djokovic no chance of returning.\n\nAnother rare unforced error from Djokovic there as he sends a fairly straightforward backhand long. Alcaraz senses weakness and finishes the game off. Djokovic almost never makes those mistakes and will be furious.\n\nAlcaraz predicts the drop-shot from Djokovic there. The Serb holds his ground though, putting the Spaniard off as he scuffs it in between the tramlines.\n\nThe defence from Alcaraz is impregnable. Djokic blasts a forehand to the far right corner which forces a sliding Alcaraz to return high. Djokovic smashes, but Alcaraz returns, resulting in a stunned Novak hitting an easy one into the net. Again Alcaraz defends, showing off his wheels as he somehow returns a short one despite starting from the other side of the court. Djokovic wins the point and can't help but laugh at the sheer speed of his opponent.\n\nAlcaraz forces break point and almost delivers after again returning a couple of smashes from Djokovic which I'm convinced only he could do. No shot is too hard or too far for this man.\n\nDjokovic continues to shake his head. His forehand clips the net giving Alcaraz time to think. Expecting it to come hard and fast, he cups it over the net, giving Djokovic no chance.\n\nWe're going back and forth here as Djokovic saves break-point after break-point. he simply cannot believe some of the returns his opponent is conjuring up.\n\nThe Serb starts to push back, earning a couple of game-points of his own but Alcaraz holds on, coming up with some ingenious manoeuvres to get himself back in it.\n\nDjokovic finally converts after a long game - it feels like this will be a pivotal one as somehow Alcaraz walks away without a break.\n\nOnly seven unforced errors from Djokovic to Alcaraz's eleven, but that's two in this game alone. He goes for a backhand slice to get the Spaniard running but it won't creep over the net. Next he tries a cross-court forehand which again falls too short.\n\nIt's all tied up here as Djokovic has been the only one to threaten a break thus far.\n\nAlcaraz lets out a yell of frustration as he mishits Djokovic's serve sending it vertical. It's Djokovic's turn to up the ante, matching Alcaraz's rampaging forehand with his own two-handed crusher.\n\nThat'll be seven holds so far as Djokovic exorcizes whatever demons caused him such trouble at Wimbledon - perhaps the extra couple of weeks post operation has returned the power that he was so clearly missing.\n\nHow are you supposed to return that forehand? Alcaraz makes quick work of that game and is strutting his stuff, bumping his head to the music.\n\nIt's Alcaraz's turn to complain here as Djokovic sends him scampering to his right before smashing a forehand volley down the line.\n\nHe comes back straight away though, darting forward to return a short one, placing it just on the line. The athleticism is on full display as he follows this rapid movement with a crashing backhand which wrongfoots Djokovic and earns him a break point.\n\nDjokovic saves three break-points as this turns into a chess match with both players making adjustments after each point, countering the other's. He finally gets his serve spot on, setting up an easy smash to win the game.\n\nA fantastic rally at 15-0 here as both players blast shots cross-court with immense power. Alcaraz is liking the short shots but Djokovic predicted that one and finishes it to the gaping right-hand side of the court.\n\nThe Serbian is picking his moments, waiting for Alcaraz to make mistakes at times, but knowing when to unleash a venomous winner. He goes 40-0 up and has three break-points.\n\nAnd just like that, Alcaraz brings it level. Djokovic is venting to his team after a missed opportunity and the crowd doesn't like it - a frustrated shrug illustrates his lack of patience for the loud criticism.\n\nHe brings it all the way back and totally reverses the momentum in this game. The precision on the forehand is back as he sends Djokovic this way and then that, ultimately setting up an easy volley winner with the Serb too far to even consider a return.\n\nDjokovic misplaces a smash after forcing Alcaraz into a stretching and sliding back-handed backhand return. The Spaniard goes 30-0 up looking to break.\n\nNovak does not feel the pressure. He wins all the remaining points in the game and holds his serve. Alcaraz is sending a couple of his forehands long but we'll put that down to overzealous excitement.\n\nDjokovic will don a white baseball cap as he switches sides for the second game.\n\nHe attacks aggressively on Alcaraz's second serve - clearly trying to take the game to him.\n\nAlcaraz's forehand looks typically imperious. The power he generates is beggar's belief. He comes to the net with a 30-15 but the veteran is too savvy, and whips the ball cross-court and out of reach.\n\nWe're starting to see some quality rallies early here as Djokovic forces deuce. This feels like experience against energy as Alcaraz's pace and power faces Djokovic's precision and consistency. The quality on display is fantastic.\n\nAlcaraz saves break point and then finally wins the game as Djokovic misdirects a backhand.\n\nA couple of unforced errors to start here from Alcaraz as he sends a straightforward forehand long in the first point, and then another into the net in the third.\n\nDjokovic looks strong as he manipulates the Spaniard around the court and goes 40-0 up. Nevertheless, Alcaraz shows off his youthful speed, reaching an attempted drop-shot with ease and sending it out of reach.\n\nThe Serb converts with a fast serve wide to the right hand side of the court, winning the first game 40-30.\n\nThey'll take a moment to settle in before Djokovic serves the first ball of this match. This is a truly historic moment.\n\nThe first time he competed in the Olympics was in 2008. Alcaraz was five years old at the time...\n\nHe gets a huge reception - he'll prefer that to Wimbledon.\n\nHe receives a warm welcome for the crowd in Roland-Garros today.\n\nThe youngest versus the oldest at these Olympics.\n\nThe best two tennis players in the world are about to take the court.\n\nAs Nadal comes close to hanging up his racket, and Federer is already a distant memory, father time has finally come for Britain's darling.\n\nCompeting in the doubles after a defiant display at Wimbledon earlier this summer, Andy Murray teamed up with Dan Evans in an effort to do the impossible and compete for one last medal.\n\nThey managed to conjure up not one but two great escapes showing off that relentless desire to win at all costs.\n\nFirst it was Japan and then Belgium in a super tie-break comeback which was something out of a child's imagination.\n\nAs they don't play deciding sets in the Olympics it came down to a first-to-ten but win-by-two scenario it was all the more intense. But when Evans smashed it straight into the ground to win the game the euphoria was overwhelming.\n\nThey celebrated like they had won it all. And to us, they had.\n\nThe road had to end somewhere and sadly it was the two Americans, Fritz and Paul, who stood in the way.\n\nThey were outmatched and ultimately overcome, but it was a tournament to remember and a sensational way to wrap up a legendary career.\n\nDjokovic is in a red shirt with white shorts whilst Alcaraz dons yellow shorts and a red top.\n\nBoth look loose and calm at this stage.\n\nIt's easy to make comparisons between the two. It sometimes seems Alcaraz is following Nadal's script.\n\nBoth young Spanish stars burst onto the scene and audaciously started winning right away. They both made taking down legends their wheelhouse speciality.\n\nIf we are witnessing the reemergence of a Nadal-esque talent we could well be in for a long road of dominance and titles. I've already seen enough to think he could surpass him - a tall order but one that Alcaraz is fully capable of fulfilling\n\nBut instead of standing one up against the other, these Olympics gave us the gift of seeing them compete together for their country.\n\nAnd it was glorious. They beat Argentinian duo Molteni and Gonzalez in two close sets before taking on and defeating the Dutch pair Griekspoor and Koolhof in the super tie-break.\n\nAs all good things do, it came to an end in the quarter-finals when the Americans, Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek, asserted their superiority in spite of the 15,000 disappointed fans who were staunchly behind the Spanish team.\n\nI think that will be Nadal's legacy. A player nobody ever wanted to see lose because to see him play for just one more point was worth it. Alcaraz will no doubt carry the mantle and adhere to his predecessor's example.\n\n...this is Djokovic's first Olympic finals!\n\nThe Serb has lost his last three semi-finals at the Olympics, only winning bronze once. Can he finally get that gold medal he has so relentlessly coveted.\n\nThis was one of tennis's longest and most spectacular rivalries which has never failed to entertain. Two true legends who always knew how to perform and played tennis the right way.\n\n60 contests, Djokovic leading 31-29, there really isn't much separating them. Nadal was always the king of the clay but Djokovic ruled the grass - and for a while pretty much everything else.\n\nWhilst there was certainly the usual hype building up for their match, it did feel bittersweet as Nadal looks to be at the back end of his career, no longer the imperious savant we were accustomed to.\n\nThe Spaniard had lost just four times in these hallowed grounds demonstrating just how at home he is here.\n\nNevertheless, Djokovic is not one for long drawn-own goodbyes. He dismantled Nadal 6-1, 6-4, refusing to play with his food. He is on a mission and isn't interested in any niceties.\n\nNadal was valiant, but admitted he doesn't have the legs of his youth.\n\n\"Playing against Novak without creating damage to him, without having the legs of 20 years ago, is almost impossible now,\" he lamented afterwards.\n\nDjokovic had accepted the possibility that this was the so-called 'last dance' between the pair. But Nadal was more defensive when that suggestion was put to him a few days ago. \"Who says it's the last dance?\" he said, with a quizzical raised eyebrow, sending the tennis rumour mill whirring.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz has won all four major finals he has taken part in, including Wimbledon in 2022, and 2024, the US Open in 2022, and the French Open this year.\n\nEarlier this summer he faced Djokovic in the Wimbledon finals, winning in straight sets and displaying a level of dominance over the Serb we have never seen before.\n\nNovak underwent surgery on a torn meniscus just five weeks before the tournament and yet still steamrolled his way through the tournament to reach the finals.\n\nAnd yet, he was totally outclassed. Alcaraz beamed 42 clean winners to Djokovic's 26 and was manipulating him across the court. He was superior in every department and gave up nothing.\n\n\"He played every single shot better than I did,\" acknowledged Djokovic after his 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 defeat. \"He just was better than me in every aspect of the game: in movement, in the way he was striking the ball beautifully, serving great, everything.\"\n\nAsked about the aftermath of his knee surgery, Djokovic said \"That probably had an effect, particularly in the opening rounds. As the tournament progressed, I felt better and better. But yeah, today I was half a step behind him.\"\n\nNovak will need to play at a much higher level if he is to stand a chance in this one.\n\nIn the first of three contests scheduled to be played on Court Phillipe-Chatrier it was the Women's Doubles bronze medal match. The Spanish duo Busca and Sorribes Tormo won 6-2, 6-2, against Czech players Muchova and Noskova in a fairly one-sided affair.\n\nThe Spaniards hit 18 winners and lulled the Czechs into 26 unforced errors with a classy performance. They were impeccable at the net, displaying inhumane reactions and clinical placement.\n\n\"We are speechless,\" said Christina Busca. \"We are crying. This is a dream that has just come true. There are so many people I would like to thank. I am just speechless.\n\n\"After the semi-final I was sure that we would play for the bronze medal and win it.\"\n\nSara Sorribes said, \"It's really incredible what we've achieved to get a bronze medal - it's crazy.\n\n\"After the match we lost I knew we were going to make it.\"\n\nThis is the dream. First seed up against second seed. The two best tennis players in the world. An established legend who refuses to age versus a young champion hungry for more. A rematch of the Wimbledon finals. Are you not entertained?\n\nDjokovic comes into this match having dominated all would-be contenders, including beating Alcaraz's doubles teammate and fading legend Rafael Nadal.\n\nHe began the tournament against Matthew Ebden, dispatching the Australian in straight sets and only dropping a single game. Ebden won gold in the men's doubles yesterday in a tie-break which ended 10-8.\n\nIn the second round, he took on Nadal, again winning in two sets. Djokovic-Nadal at Roland Garros has been one of the great fixtures of modern sport. They've faced each other 60 times, with Djokovic now leading Nadal 31-29. The Spanish stalwart is in the twilight of his career and Djokovic was able to make easy work of this one. Sadly, it's likely to be the last.\n\nAfter beating the German Dominik Koepfer and the Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas respectively, he faced Lorenzo Musetti in the semi-finals.\n\nSpeaking after his victory, the one-time Olympic medalist said, \"It was such a tense match, there were a lot of emotions, so much expectations and stress particularly as a win meant I would secure a medal for my country and it's my first Olympic final. I'm thrilled.\n\n\"I was very nervous before the match because I lost three out of four of my semi-finals in the Olympic Games, so I really wanted to get over this hurdle.\n\n\"I lost quite comfortably to Carlos [Alcaraz] at Wimbledon but this is a different surface and I'm playing better and moving better than I was at Wimbledon, and in a way I have nothing to lose as I already have a medal, so I'm going to go for it.\"\n\nHe faces the stiffest of challenges in his first Olympic finals in Carlos Alcaraz who already holds the past two Wimbledon finals over his head.\n\nAlcaraz has dominated on his way to the finals, juggling playing doubles with Nadal at the same time. He comes into this one the favourite although the last time they faced off at Roland Garros Djokovic came out victorious.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

The others are Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, and Steffi Graf.\n\nDjokovic had to deliver one of the finest performances of his career to deny a man 16 years his junior.\n\n\"It was an incredible fight and I had to play my best tennis,\" an emotional Djokovic said on court as flag-waving Serbian fans sang his name. \"I put my heart, my soul, everything to win gold. I did it for my country first, for Serbia.\"\n\nIn a raucous atmosphere, with soccer-style chants shattering the calm of the adjacent Bois de Boulogne, neither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest.\n\nAlcaraz cracked first in the tie-break and when another tie-break was required to decide the second set, Djokovic again found another gear, sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner down the line.\n\nDjokovic roared to the sky and after consoling Alcaraz at the net, he fell to his knees and sobbed on the court before climbing into the crowd to be swamped by his family, friends and team.\n\nWhile Djokovic, the oldest player to win the Olympic singles title since the sport returned to the Games in 1988, cried tears of joy, the 21-year-old Alcaraz was

'This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.'\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tie-breakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final just three weeks ago. ALSO READ: Carlos Alcaraz beats Novak Djokovic in five-set thriller to win Wimbledon final.\n\n'In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tie-breaks, he played an impressive game,' said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. 'That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.'\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him -- and Alcaraz said on Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic -- and the 'highest mountain to climb at the moment,' in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThere was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defence. The No.1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No.2 Alcaraz saved six.\n\n'We both played at a very high level,' Djokovic said. 'We really went toe-to-toe.'\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 90 minutes, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tie-breaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points, then turned to face his guest box -- which included his tennis team and his wife and their two children -- with a fist held high.\n\nIn the second tie-breaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.\n\n'There are always doubts. Absolutely, I had doubts,' Djokovic said. 'But the belief and the conviction that I can make it is stronger than my doubts. It always has been. I knew that it's going to happen. It was just a matter of when it's going to happen.'", "source": {"uri": "spainenglish.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spain in English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epic poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo\u017ee_pravde", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bo\u017ee pravde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.spainenglish.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-04-at-23.59.14.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal in 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he has made clear that simply was not sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medallist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nWhen the victory was his, when the gold was his, thanks to one last forehand winner, Djokovic turned toward his team in the stands -- sitting in front of his wife and their two children -- and dropped his racket as he knelt on the clay. As emotional as ever, he cried and covered his face, then rose and grabbed a red-white-and-blue Serbian flag. After hugs in the stands, Djokovic waved that flag. Alcaraz wept afterward, too.\n\nWATCH | Djokovic overcome with emotion after finally completing the career Golden Slam:\n\nThe final, which lasted 2 hours, 50 minutes despite being decided in only two sets, was a rematch of the Wimbledon title match three weeks ago that Alcaraz won to follow up his French Open title in June.\n\nAlcaraz also defeated Djokovic in last year's final at the All England Club, but Djokovic won when they met in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open, the annual clay-court tournament held at Roland Garros, the site used for tennis during these Olympics.\n\nSunday's contest was an enthralling matchup, featuring one of the best to ever do it in Djokovic, and the best at the moment in Alcaraz. Indeed, could have been frustrating for Djokovic to find himself once again across the net from a younger, speedier version of himself. Maybe that's why Djokovic frequently looked up and gesticulated and muttered toward his guest box.\n\nStill, he came out on top.\n\nIt required long exchanges filled with superb ball-striking at the baseline, deft drop shots -- Alcaraz's tended to be more successful, sometimes so good Djokovic declined to even give chase -- and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense at both ends. They served so well that neither got broken even once: Djokovic saved eight break points, Alcaraz six.\n\nMost remarkable, perhaps, was how cleanly both men played, despite the talent of the opposition and pressure of the occasion. Unforced errors were rare.\n\nWATCH | Auger-Aliassime beaten by Italy's Musetti in men's single bronze match:\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, the loser -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Make no mistake, this encounter between the No. 1-seeded Djokovic and No. 2-seeded Alcaraz was worthy of a major final, and no one fortunate enough to hold a ticket could complain about not getting their money's worth.\n\nThose in the stands became part of the show, repeatedly breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. In the second set, as Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters began chanting, \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\") while shaking their red-and-yellow flags. Chair umpire Damien Dumusois occasionally reminded folks to remain silent during the action.\n\nBoth men played to the crowd. When Alcaraz raced to reach one drop shot and deposit it over the net for a winner, he basked in the raucous reaction by pointing his right index finger to his ear. When Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point to lead 3-2 in the second tiebreaker, he waved both arms overhead to encourage folks who already were on their feet, screaming.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, chock full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes, including five break chances for Alcaraz, before Djokovic managed to hold for a 5-4 lead. In the tiebreaker, Djokovic was superior in crunch time, as he so often is, taking the last four points.\n\nAt 3-all, Alcaraz delivered a body serve, but Djokovic slid just enough to his left to smack a cross-court forehand return winner. After two mistakes by Alcaraz, Djokovic produced a volley winner and turned to face his family with a fist held high.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7285154.1722784085!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/djokovic-gold-04082024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Fast forward three years later, the Serbian legend finally has his hands on the ellusive gold.\n\nThe blockbuster gold medal clash had its fair share of highlights, with Alcaraz flaunting off his ace and Djokovic shinning with his precision.\n\nIn a neck-to-neck battle, Djokovic sealed the first game and stood inches away from breaking Alcaraz's serve.\n\nThroughout the first set, fierce rallies unfolded with Alcaraz, quick as lightning, pulling off slapshots backhand and forehand shots from his arsenal. Djokovic relied on using the court to his advantage and negating the threat that Alacaraz carried.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic stood steps away from breaking each other's serve numerous times. Eventually, Djokovic managed to take away Alcaraz's advantage during the breakpoint and smiled. Each time Alcaraz denied the Serbian to go ahead in the game, the Spaniard was more aggressive and animated in his reaction.\n\nWith the first set level at 6-6, the game went into a tiebreak. Djokovic took the first point after Alcaraz's attempt to slice a forehand shot went wide.\n\nThe Spaniard fought back to take the next point. The duo seemed inseparable until Djokovic upped the ante to take four consecutive points to seal the first set in his favour.\n\nIn the second set, the uncanny resemblance to the opening set continued to keep the packed audience in a state of trance.\n\nDjokovic ensured that Alcaraz had no room to get close to the net and take control of their intense rallies. The second set featured some delightful rallies, forcing the fans to stand on their feet and appreciate the spectacle that the two produced. Drop shot was a common theme throughout those rallies, which was used by both tennis stars to overcome each other.\n\nWith the second set, going right down the wire at 6-6, Alcaraz needed to take the second set home to keep his hopes of standing at the top of the podium alive.\n\nDjokovic raced to a 2-0 lead but Alcaraz fought back to level the scoreline. Djokovic relied on his strong forehand play to turn his dream into reality and win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe heartbreak that Djokovic suffered in the Wimbledon final last month at the hands of Alcaraz became a distant memory.

Four times he tried and four times he failed to win a gold medal at the Olympics, a piece of hardware he sought not only for personal prestige but as a means of honoring his country.\n\nDjokovic on Sunday completed his journey at the 2024 Paris Olympics taking down Spain's Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-3) in straight sets to win the gold medal for Serbia and complete the iconic Golden Slam that puts him in distinct company.\n\nThe moment meant so much to Djokovic, 37, that he was not only crying tears of joy but physically shaking with a towel over his face as he attempted to process what he just accomplished.\n\nDjokovic entered Sunday's gold medal match as the oldest player in history to reach an Olympic tennis singles final. By taking down Alcaraz, he joins an elite list of tennis players who have Olympic gold along with titles in each of the four major championships. The Golden Slam has only been won previously by Germany's Steffi Graf (1988), the United States' Andre Agassi (1999), Spain's Rafael Nadal (2010) and the United States' Serena Williams (2012).\n\n\"I'm overwhelmed with everything that I'm feeling right now. Millions of different emotions, of course positive,\" Djokovic said. \"Too proud. Too happy. Thrilled with the possibility to fight for a gold and to win a gold for the first time in my career for my country, arguably the biggest success I've ever had.\"\n\nBeating Alcaraz was not an easy task as their battle lasted 2 hours and 52 minutes. It was intense from the start as the ninth game of the first set lasted about 15 minutes with Djokovic needing to save five break points to take a 5-4 lead. He had to truly earn every single point with the first set taking 1 hour and 34 minutes, including a tiebreak.\n\nThe job did not get any easier as the match continued as Alcaraz was doing everything in his power to force a third set. After an hour spent in the second set, they had to go into another tiebreak.\n\nThough Alcaraz gave his all and fought back from a 2-0 deficit to even the tiebreak, Djokovic's will overcame the 21-year-old's youth as he won five straight points to claim gold with Alcaraz earning silver.\n\n\"I'm a little bit disappointed, but I'm going to leave the court with the head really really high,\" said Alcaraz, already a four-time major winner. \"I gave everything I had. Fighting for Spain, it was everything to me. I'm proud of the way I played today.\"\n\nWhile this was possibly Djokovic's last Olympics, Alcaraz is the youngest man to win a Grand Slam title on grass, clay and hard courts, and he's the youngest to make it to the gold medal match in the Olympics in 36 years.\n\nItaly's Lorenzo Musetti previously earned the bronze medal on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabel_gonzalez@cbssports.com", "name": "Isabel Gonzalez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/08/04/53ccab9e-a7bd-46d9-8fe3-74a000d45de0/thumbnail/1200x675/eafa9fc4ebebcf483ee31992e0d668d9/novak-djokovic-tennis-olympics-g.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The Serbian star now joins the Golden Slam club: players who have won all four major tournaments -- the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and U.S. Open -- and an Olympics gold. He joins Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, and Serena Williams.\n\nWith the second set tiebreaker tied 2-2, Djokovic, 37, unleashed a devastating cross court-winner, on an Alcaraz service game, that granted him all momentum. Alcaraz committed a few unforced errors after that. After Djokovic's ferocious match point winner, he looked up in the stands in disbelief. Following his handshake with Alcaraz, he fell to the Roland Garros clay, and knelt down for a moment. Djokovic, overcome with emotion, went back to his bench, put his head in a white towel and cried.\n\nDjokovic has accomplished everything imaginable in tennis. But the Olympics will do that to you. Representing your country will do that to you.\n\nRead More: Which Olympic Sport Is Hardest on the Body?\n\nDjokovic made no secret of his desire for an Olympic gold, as a career capstone. He now has it.\n\nAt 4-4 in the first set and Djokovic serving, Alcaraz, 21, had several opportunities to break his opponent. After executing a beautiful drop shot to stave off Alcaraz in that game, Djokovic let out a roar, his most emphatic gesture on the court to that point. Djokovic's drop shot was on all day. He won that first-set tiebreaker in surprisingly easy fashion.\n\nAll day long, Alcaraz had sauce on shots. But he couldn't solve the man who's arguably the greatest defensive player in tennis history. Djokovic kept his stamina even after a handful of points that left him running to his water bottle. Djokovic visibly frustrated Alacaraz, who at one point kicked a ball into the net in anger.\n\nThe Spanish flags waving and hanging around Roland Garros outnumbered the Serbian ones. But Djokoic still earned his fair share of support. \"Nole! Nole!\" the appreciative fans in the stands chanted. You could hear cheers for Novak outside Court Philippe-Chatrier during the women's doubles bronze medal match. Djokovic will always have his detractors. But his late-career excellence, and more gracious on-court demeanor the last few years, have gone a long way towards winning over the public skeptical of his Covid-era behavior and anti-vax stance. Playing in the Olympics -- a tournament that many tennis pros skipped -- should continue to boost his popularity.\n\nRead More: What Olympic Athletes Eat to Have All That Energy\n\nThe win comes a few weeks after Alcaraz routed Djokvic in straight sets at the Wimbledon final. \"I feel like I'm a different player than I was at Wimbledon,\" Djokovic said before the final. \"The way I move, the way I'm striking the ball. Not to take anything away from him winning the Wimbledon finals, he was dominating and deservedly a winner, but I feel more confident about myself and my chances in the finals.\"\n\nHis self-assessment was quite accurate. Djokovic moved and struck. He proved he can still win more majors.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_gregory@time.com", "name": "Sean Gregory", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164614008.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as - no, make that more than - every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier's red clay at the end and why his tears flowed.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,\" said Djokovic, who didn't drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. \"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.\"\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\n\"In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,\" said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. \"That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.\"\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze - and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him - and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nUntil getting Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Djokovic said, \"I was ready.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic - and the \"highest mountain to climb at the moment,\" in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThere was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense. The No. 1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No. 2 Alcaraz saved six. Pressure? Ha. What pressure?\n\n\"We both played at a very high level,\" Djokovic said. \"We really went toe-to-toe.\"\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans - and, naturally, Alcaraz - was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. As Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters chanted \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\").\n\nYet the place was as quiet as a theater between points; play was delayed briefly when a young child's crying pierced the air that was thick with anticipation.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tiebreaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points, then turned to face his guest box - which included his tennis team and his wife and their two children - with a fist held high.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.\n\nWas he worried that moment would never arrive?\n\n\"There are always doubts. Absolutely, I had doubts,\" Djokovic said. \"But the belief and the conviction that I can make it is stronger than my doubts. It always has been. I knew that it's going to happen. It was just a matter of when it's going to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as -- no, make that more than -- every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier's red clay at the end and why his tears flowed.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,\" said Djokovic, who didn't drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. \"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.\"\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\n\"In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,\" said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. \"That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.\"\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking during the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him -- and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nUntil getting past Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Djokovic said, \"I was ready.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic -- and the \"highest mountain to climb at the moment,\" in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThere was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense. The No. 1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No. 2 Alcaraz saved six. Pressure? Ha. What pressure?\n\n\"We both played at a very high level,\" Djokovic said. \"We really went toe-to-toe.\"\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, Alcaraz -- was the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. As Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters chanted \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\").\n\nYet the place was as quiet as a theater between points; play was delayed briefly when a young child's crying pierced the air that was thick with anticipation.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1\u00bd hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread for more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tiebreaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points, then turned to face his guest box -- which included his tennis team and his wife and their two children -- with a fist held high.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.\n\nWas he worried that moment would never arrive?\n\n\"There are always doubts. Absolutely, I had doubts,\" Djokovic said. \"But the belief and the conviction that I can make it is stronger than my doubts. It always has been. I knew that it's going to happen. It was just a matter of when it's going to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "newstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jefferson City News Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo\u017ee_pravde", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bo\u017ee pravde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2024/08/04/olympicstennis_wR0vmUF_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Playing on the familiar clay courts of Roland Garros, Djokovic was the oldest male finalist in an Olympic tennis tournament - and is now the oldest male winner.\n\nHe needed a pair of tiebreaks to do it, but he downed Alcaraz in straight sets, 7-6(3), 7-6(2). The loss means Alcaraz, who came into the final as the youngest male finalist in an Olympic tennis tournament, will leave his first Summer Games appearance with a silver medal.\n\nThe Serb has a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles, but his previous best finish at the Olympics came back in 2008, when he secured a bronze medal. His other appearances at the games have been disappointing, and many considered it an uphill climb to emerge with gold this year given all the young talent and Djokovic's own struggles this tennis season.\n\nBut he looked nothing like the injury-riddled 37-year-old who didn't win any of the Grand Slams this year on Sunday. When he faced Alcaraz, a man who beat him in the finals of one of those very slams just before the Olympics began, he looked every bit of his No. 1 ranking.\n\nEarly in the match, Djokovic took advantage of Alcaraz's aggressive play with punishing shots from difficult angles -- his specialty. But though Djokovic threatened a quick break, Alcaraz fought it off and held to start. A couple games later, and Djokovic had a triple break opportunity, but this was handled by Alcaraz as well.\n\nThey went back-and-forth in that fashion for much of the first set. Djokovic kept hitting shots that looked like Alcaraz would have no chance to get to them, but he frequently did and put the ball back in play. Both players had trouble finishing the job with breaks on the line, though. No breaks were earned in 13 attempts, leading to a first set tiebreak, which was won by Djokovic.\n\nThe second set went very much like the first -- both players refused to break despite several attempts on either side. Alcaraz had numerous forced errors as he frequently was able to make it to Djokovic's shots, but couldn't get his return in. They wound up going to another tiebreak, with Djokovic getting a point on Alcaraz's first serve, setting the tone.\n\nDjokovic and Alcaraz made it to the final after dispatching their surprise semifinal opponents in Lorenzo Musetti of Italy and Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada, respectively. That left Musetti and Auger-Aliassime to face each other for the bronze medal, which ultimately went to Musetti and Italy. He bested Auger-Aliassime in three sets on Saturday to claim the bronze, leaving Sunday's match between Djokovic and Alcaraz the only unsettled business.\n\nOn their way to the semifinals, Djokovic and Alcaraz took on some top competition, but some very big names were left out. Two of the biggest in Germany's Alexander Zverev and Norway's Casper Ruud, both ranked in the top six, fell to Musetti and Auger-Aliassime in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn his quarterfinal match, Alcaraz downed American Tommy Paul in straight sets, ending the USA's hope at getting a medal in the bracket. Djokovic had a similar straight sets victory over his quarterfinal opponent, the eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas. He also faced Rafael Nadal in the second round, and took down the Spaniard in straight sets while both were dealing with injuries.\n\nGoing into Sunday's final, Alcaraz and Djokovic had split six career meetings. That also included splitting the only two times they played each other on clay courts. While Djokovic, at 37 years old, is not likely to return to Olympic competition in four years time, Alcaraz should have more than enough time to add to his medal count at just 21 years old.\n\nFull results for the medal matchups in the men's singles bracket are below.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brady@sbnation.com", "name": "James Brady", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Tsitsipas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefanos Tsitsipas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Op7iyNTRGSLwJp14xhDsmVDb__w=/0x0:7728x3864/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25559044/2164807948.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

I did it for my country first, for Serbia.\"\n\nIn a raucous atmosphere, with soccer-style chants shattering the calm of the adjacent Bois de Boulogne, neither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest.\n\nThe first set alone lasted one hour 33 minutes as the two wrestled for control in a series of spellbinding games, one at 4-4 in which Djokovic repelled five break points.\n\nAlcaraz blinked first in the tiebreak to allow Djokovic to move ahead and when another tiebreak was required to decide the second set, again Djokovic found inspiration, moving 6-2 in front and sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner.\n\nDjokovic roared to the sky and after consoling a crestfallen Alcaraz at the net, then fell to his knees and sobbed into the Parisian clay in the centre of the court before climbing into the crowd where he was swamped by his family, friends and team.\n\nWhile Djokovic became the oldest Olympic singles champion since tennis returned to the Games in 1988, the 21-year-old Alcaraz looked inconsolable after failing to add the gold medal to this year's French Open and Wimbledon crowns.\n\n\"I think I did a really great tournament, I think I did a really great match,\" the four-time Grand Slam champion said. \"Obviously in front of me, I had a really hungry Novak.\"\n\nDjokovic had lost three times in Olympic singles semi-finals with a solitary bronze medal to show from four previous Games.\n\nHe knew Paris was his last realistic chance to fill the remaining space in a bulging trophy cabinet containing 24 Grand Slam titles. And how he earned it -- overturning a crushing loss to Alcaraz three weeks ago in the Wimbledon final to become the first man to win the Olympic singles title without dropping a set.\n\nINCREDIBLE FIGHT\n\nDjokovic joins an elite group of Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams, the latter watching from the front row, in the Golden Slam club, and many will say this settled the G.O.A.T argument once and for all.\n\nIt takes something pretty special to upstage the men's 100 metres final taking place later at the Stade de France, but this near three-hour red-dirt duel arguably came close.\n\nThe opening four games spanned 30 mesmerizing minutes, every rally a battle of skill and wills. Alcaraz saved three break points in the fourth game and looked menacing as he threw everything in his arsenal at Djokovic as the Serb served at 4-4.\n\nSeveral times Djokovic could only smile at the athleticism of his opponent who piled on the pressure to earn five break points, and somehow he survived.\n\nAlcaraz saved a set point at 5-6 but the Spaniard's level dipped in the tiebreak and Djokovic pounced to grab the lead. Sensing his moment, Djokovic's intensity went even higher deep in the second set but Alcaraz hung on.\n\nDjokovic was relentless though and an outrageous forehand winner at 2-2 in the breaker snapped Alcaraz's resistance and the end then came quickly as he claimed the 99th, and perhaps most valuable, title of his glittering career.\n\nA memorable week ended with Italy's Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini beating Russian neutral players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider 2-6 6-1 (10-7) to win the women's gold, adding to compatriot Lorenzo Musetti's men's singles bronze.", "source": {"uri":

I don't play only to win the tournaments.\n\n\"I don't know about the future, I really want to be in the present moment to celebrate. It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal. So now it's about happiness, joy and celebration.\"\n\nIt was played in a superb spirit, with both players often left laughing at the quality of the other's shot-making.\n\nThe crowd was equally split between Spanish fans, decked in flags, and Serbia supporters carrying signs with \"Nole\" - Djokovic's nickname - written on.\n\nAn electric atmosphere added to the tension - Alcaraz looked the more nervous and had to save a break point in his opening game, but he pushed Djokovic to the limit with his mix of touch and power.\n\nHowever, Djokovic simply would not give in. He played some of his best tennis when down break point and, after taking the first set, was full of confidence.\n\nThere was the occasional gesture towards his support box - who responded by telling him to keep his head up and stay positive - but on the whole, Djokovic was as dialled in as he has been all year.\n\nIt has been a difficult season for Djokovic. He lost in the Australian Open semi-finals to Italy's Jannik Sinner, had an indifferent hard court swing, needed knee surgery after injuring himself at Roland Garros and was completely outplayed in his first final of the season at Wimbledon.\n\nHowever, that will only make this victory that much sweeter for a man who shows no sign of stopping - and has not ruled out competing at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\nItaly win women's doubles gold\n\nElsewhere, Italy took gold in the women's doubles as Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani beat Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider - the Russian pair playing under a neutral banner.\n\nAndreeva and Shnaider are the first Russian athletes to medal at Paris 2024.\n\nThey were beaten 2-6 6-1 10-7 by Wimbledon finalist Paolini and former doubles world number one Errani.\n\nSpain's Cristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo beat Czech Republic's Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova 6-2 6-2 in the bronze-medal match.", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke",

He overturned his crushing loss to Alcaraz in last month's Wimbledon final to become the first man to win the Olympic singles without dropping a set.\n\n\"It was an incredible fight and I had to play my best tennis,\" an emotional Djokovic told Eurosport before the medals ceremony as Serbian fans celebrated in the stands.\n\n\"It was fair that the two sets finished in tiebreaks. I put my heart, my soul, everything to win gold.\n\n\"I did it for my country first, for Serbia.\"\n\nDjokovic joins an elite club of Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and Steffi Graf in winning all four Grand Slams and the Olympic title in their careers.\n\nIn women's doubles play, No. 8 seeds Cristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo of Spain won the bronze medal, topping Czechs Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-2 at Roland Garros. For the Spaniards, this was just their second event playing doubles together.\n\nThe gold-medal match was to be played later Sunday between No. 3 seeds Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini of Italy and unseeded Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider.", "source": {"uri": "sanluisobispo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@sanluisobispo.com", "name":

Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as -- no, make that more than -- every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier's red clay at the end and why his tears flowed.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,\" said Djokovic, who didn't drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. \"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.\"\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\n\"In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,\" said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. \"That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.\"\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him -- and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nUntil getting Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Djokovic said, \"I was ready.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic -- and the \"highest mountain to climb at the moment,\" in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThere was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense. The No. 1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No. 2 Alcaraz saved six. Pressure? Ha. What pressure?\n\n\"We both played at a very high level,\" Djokovic said. \"We really went toe-to-toe.\"\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, Alcaraz -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. As Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters chanted \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\").\n\nYet the place was as quiet as a theater between points; play was delayed briefly when a young child's crying pierced the air that was thick with anticipation.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tiebreaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points, then turned to face his guest box -- which included his tennis team and his wife and their two children -- with a fist held high.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.\n\nWas he worried that moment would never arrive?\n\n\"There are always doubts. Absolutely, I had doubts,\" Djokovic said. \"But the belief and the conviction that I can make it is stronger than my doubts. It always has been. I knew that it's going to happen. It was just a matter of when it's going to happen.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima

Djokovic beat Spain's Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) in an enthralling final at the Court Phillippe Chartier in Paris.\n\n\"This is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had and the most special feeling,\" the 37-year-old Serb said. \"I want to play in Los Angeles, I enjoy playing for my country in the Olympic Games, in the Davis Cup,\" he added.

He also managed to beat Alcaraz, who got the better of him in two consecutive Wimbledon finals.\n\nThe 37-year-old said that he was not assured of a win until the final shot and gave his everything thinking that this could be his last shot at the Olympic gold.\n\n\"Now at the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had.\"\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" said Djokovic.\n\n\"I knew that this could be my last chance of a gold medal,\" added Djokovic at his post-final press conference still draped in his country's flag and with his medal hanging proudly around his neck.\n\n\"I did everything I possibly could to prepare myself for this period. The injury sidetracked me a little bit. But coming into the Olympic Games, I felt like a different player in terms of how I moved, how I played.\n\nAlcaraz, 21, was also in tears after the match, but became the youngest to win a silver medal in the tennis event on his Olympic debut.\n\n\"In a way losing heavily to Alcaraz at Wimbledon probably worked in my favour as I knew I couldn't play any worse than that.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/novak-djokovic-05092461-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=z.OftCwtLHmqYcjKnO3Fe2zKz44ZDj6a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The 37-year-old finished on top in Paris after he defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles final on Centre Court. He won the match 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3) at Philippe Chatrier. It also happened to be his second medal in the Olympics after he clinched bronze back in Beijing 2008.\n\nDjokovic also completed the career golden glam after Steffi Graf (1998), Andre Agassi (1999), Andre Agassi (1999), Rafael Nadal (2010) and Serena Williams (2012). Djokovic had to fight for nearly three hours to get the better of Alcaraz, who earlier defeated him in the final of Wimbledon 2024.\n\nBoth the sets went right down to the wire, but once they went into tie-breaks, Djokovic showed why he is deemed as of the greats of the game.\n\n\"I don't know.

That exclusive group also features Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Serena Williams, who was in the stands to witness this pulsating contest.\n\nHow much this triumph meant to Djokovic was immediately evident. Upon winning match point, he roared with delight, dropped to his knees, then tearfully embraced his family and coaching team.\n\nA Serbian flag was soon brought out, and the 37-year-old - the oldest man to win an Olympics singles gold medal - still seemed shaken with joy when he returned to his courtside chair. This is the first title that Djokovic has won all year, but arguably the one he wanted the most.\n\n\"I couldn't be prouder and happier,\" said Djokovic, who won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n\"Playing for Serbia has always been my utmost, real pleasure, my priority ... I'm just so proud to be a part of an elite number of athletes that managed to win gold for their countries in their respective sports.\"\n\nOlympic tennis competitions can be a strange thing, arriving at awkward times in the calendar and often missing some of the sport's top players. This, however, was an exception, a thrilling sequel to Alcaraz's straight-sets victory in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, Djokovic has returned to the court on which he sustained a knee injury while playing at the French Open in June. That seems a lifetime ago now, and one meniscus surgery and one grand slam final later, he has now filled a notable gap in his remarkable trophy cabinet.\n\nStill playing with a brace on his right knee, Djokovic started the match promisingly, creating a break point on Alcaraz's first service game.\n\nThe 21-year-old shut out the opening, which would become a common theme through the early part of the match. Djokovic had five break points in the first set and Alcaraz eight, yet neither man could edge in front.\n\nOr looking at it another way, both seemed to raise their standard when the pressure increased. That was best demonstrated at 2-1 in the first set, with Alcaraz 0-40 down on his own serve. After a quick change of rackets, he reeled off the next three points before wrapping up the game a few points later with an exquisite drop volley.\n\nThe roles reversed several games later. With the set locked at 4-4, Alcaraz's booming forehand heaped the pressure on Djokovic's serve, and the break points came thick and fast - five in that game alone. But the world No. 2 stood firm, roaring to the crowd when a volley winner denied Alcaraz the chance to get ahead.\n\nIt was fitting and probably fair that this absorbing set would be decided by a tie-break, and with the scores locked at 3-3, it was Alcaraz who cracked first. Back-to-back errors handed Djokovic three set points before another cute forehand volley completed the marathon first set in an hour and 33 minutes.\n\nUnsurprisingly, little changed in the second set, only that break points became fewer and farther between.\n\nAs the match wore on, the standard remained unrelentingly high. At 4-4, Djokovic came from 40-0 down to deuce on Alcaraz serve, prompting chants of \"Nol\u00e9! Nol\u00e9!\" from the stands. But Alcaraz had a response, winning a marathon point by sliding a shot past Djokovic at the net, then raising a finger to his ear in celebration.\n\nAn inevitable tie-break followed soon after and, once again, the 24-time grand slam champion's experience and mettle came to the fore.\n\nA stunning cross-court forehand, bringing to an end one of the longest rallies of the match, had the crowd on their feet, and Djokovic didn't lose a point from there. Another forehand winner completed the victory, which was sealed with a huge roar of delight.\n\nThereafter, the emotions flowed freely as Djokovic kissed and hugged his wife and children in the stands. This was only Serbia's second medal of the Games, and the country's sporting talisman had achieved it without dropping a set in the competition.\n\n\"I was so blessed to win everything pretty much there is to win in my sport, but this is something different,\" said Djokovic. \"This supersedes everything that I've ever felt on the tennis court after winning big trophies. It's just incredible joy.\"\n\nAt 21, Alcaraz had been aiming to become the youngest man to win an Olympic singles gold medal. Despite falling short, he played a wonderful role in this spectacle, dazzling the crowd with 25 forehand winners.\n\nHis unforced error count may have cost him - 33 to Djokovic's 25 - as well as an inferiority to his opponent in the two tie-breaks. But heading into the US swing, the world No. 3 can nonetheless reflect on a stellar two-month period: a first French Open title, a second Wimbledon title and now an Olympic silver medal.\n\n\"I'm really happy about my performance today,\" Alcaraz told reporters. \"I'm a little bit disappointed about not playing my best tennis in some situations, in difficult situations. Tie-breaks, for example, he increased his level at the top and I couldn't do it, so probably a bit sad thinking about those moments.\"\n\nIt just happened to be one of those days that Alcaraz found himself up against an opponent who was inspired and determined like never before.\n\n\"In front of me, I had a really angry Novak,\" he added, \"An impressive player today. His level was really, really high.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Thank God. I am super proud, super happy.\"\n\nHe also celebrated his moment by holding the Serbian flag in his hand with pride.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam Champion was down on his knees and tears of joy fell from his eyes after taking the game point. With the name Djokovic echoing around the stadium, the Serbian climbed the stairs and went into the stands to celebrate with his family. After Djokovic's 7-6, 7-6 win in the gold medal match, the emotions got the better of Alcaraz as he settled for the silver medal.\n\nNow after this win, he has won 24 Grand Slam titles, the most by anyone across both men's and women's tennis. Djokovic has won 10 Australian Open titles, three French Open titles, seven Wimbledon titles and four US Open titles.\n\nBesides all this, he now finally has an Olympic gold medal, which is required for a player to complete a career golden slam.\n\nAside from his dominance at Grand Slam level, Djokovic has a total of 72 big titles in tennis. After spending years trying to catch up with stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he has outshined them to become the leader of the modern-day 'Big Three' in tennis. This includes 40 ATP Masters titles as well and seven ATP Finals championship titles.\n\nNadal is second among the 'Big Three', with a total of 59 big titles, including 22 Grand Slams, which also includes a record 14 French Open titles, 36 ATP Masters titles and one Olympic gold medal in singles competition.\n\nFederer is at number three, with 20 Grand Slam titles, including a record eight Wimbledon titles, 28 ATP Masters titles and six ATP Finals titles. This all combines and make 54 big titles. He has no Olympic singles gold medal though, having one silver medal in the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nThe blockbuster gold medal clash had its fair share of highlights, with Alcaraz flaunting his ace and Djokovic shinning with his precision.\n\nIn a neck-to-neck battle, Djokovic sealed the first game and stood inches away from breaking Alcaraz's serve.\n\nThroughout the first set, fierce rallies unfolded with Alcaraz, quick as lightning, pulling off slapshots backhand and forehand shots from his arsenal. Djokovic relied on using the court to his advantage and negating the threat that Alacaraz carried.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic stood steps away from breaking each other's serve numerous times. Eventually, Djokovic managed to take away Alcaraz's advantage during the breakpoint and smiled. Each time Alcaraz denied the Serbian to go ahead in the game, the Spaniard was more aggressive and animated in his reaction.\n\nWith the first set level at 6-6, the game went into a tiebreak. Djokovic took the first point after Alcaraz's attempt to slice a forehand shot went wide.\n\nThe Spaniard fought back to take the next point. The duo seemed inseparable until Djokovic upped the ante to take four consecutive points to seal the first set in his favour.\n\nIn the second set, the uncanny resemblance to the opening set continued to keep the packed audience in a state of trance.\n\nDjokovic ensured that Alcaraz had no room to get close to the net and take control of their intense rallies. The second set featured some delightful rallies, forcing the fans to stand on their feet and appreciate the spectacle that the two produced.

Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as -- no, make that more than -- every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier's red clay at the end and why his tears flowed.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,\" said Djokovic, who didn't drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. \"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.\"\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\n\"In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,\" said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. \"That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.\"\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him -- and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nUntil getting Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Djokovic said, \"I was ready.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic -- and the \"highest mountain to climb at the moment,\" in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThere was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense. The No. 1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No. 2 Alcaraz saved six. Pressure? Ha. What pressure?\n\n\"We both played at a very high level,\" Djokovic said. \"We really went toe-to-toe.\"\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, Alcaraz -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. As Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters chanted \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\"). / AP", "source": {"uri": "sunstar.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun.Star Network Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sunstar.com.ph", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/sunstar%2F2024-08%2F5c6b6ffc-2984-4d03-b831-2c490c0f2d61%2FAP24217515648040.jpg?rect=0%2C28%2C750%2C394&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Thank God. I am super proud, super happy.\"\n\nHe also celebrated his moment by holding the Serbian flag in his hand with pride.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam Champion was down on his knees and tears of joy fell from his eyes after taking the game point. With the name Djokovic echoing around the stadium, the Serbian climbed the stairs and went into the stands to celebrate with his family. After Djokovic's 7-6, 7-6 win in the gold medal match, the emotions got the better of Alcaraz as he settled for the silver medal.\n\nNow after this win, he has won 24 Grand Slam titles, the most by anyone across both men's and women's tennis. Djokovic has won 10 Australian Open titles, three French Open titles, seven Wimbledon titles and four US Open titles.\n\nBesides all this, he now finally has an Olympic gold medal, which is required for a player to complete a career golden slam.\n\nAside from his dominance at Grand Slam level, Djokovic has a total of 72 big titles in tennis. After spending years trying to catch up with stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he has outshined them to become the leader of the modern-day 'Big Three' in tennis. This includes 40 ATP Masters titles as well and seven ATP Finals championship titles.\n\nNadal is second among the 'Big Three', with a total of 59 big titles, including 22 Grand Slams, which also includes a record 14 French Open titles, 36 ATP Masters titles and one Olympic gold medal in singles competition.\n\nFederer is at number three, with 20 Grand Slam titles, including a record eight Wimbledon titles, 28 ATP Masters titles and six ATP Finals titles. This all combines and makes 54 big titles. He has no Olympic singles gold medal though, having one silver medal in the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nThe blockbuster gold medal clash had its fair share of highlights, with Alcaraz flaunting his ace and Djokovic shinning with his precision.In a neck-to-neck battle, Djokovic sealed the first game and stood inches away from breaking Alcaraz's serve.\n\nThroughout the first set, fierce rallies unfolded with Alcaraz, quick as lightning, pulling off slapshots backhand and forehand shots from his arsenal. Djokovic relied on using the court to his advantage and negating the threat that Alacaraz carried.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic stood steps away from breaking each other's serve numerous times. Eventually, Djokovic managed to take away Alcaraz's advantage during the breakpoint and smiled. Each time Alcaraz denied the Serbian to go ahead in the game, the Spaniard was more aggressive and animated in his reaction.\n\nWith the first set level at 6-6, the game went into a tiebreak. Djokovic took the first point after Alcaraz's attempt to slice a forehand shot went wide.\n\nThe Spaniard fought back to take the next point. The duo seemed inseparable until Djokovic upped the ante to take four consecutive points to seal the first set in his favour.\n\nIn the second set, the uncanny resemblance to the opening set continued to keep the packed audience in a state of trance.\n\nDjokovic ensured that Alcaraz had no room to get close to the net and take control of their intense rallies. The second set featured some delightful rallies, forcing the fans to stand on their feet and appreciate the spectacle that the two produced. Drop shot was a common theme throughout those rallies, which was used by both tennis stars to overcome each other.\n\nWith the second set going right down the wire at 6-6, Alcaraz needed to take the second set home to keep his hopes of standing at the top of the podium alive.\n\nDjokovic raced to a 2-0 lead but Alcaraz fought back to level the scoreline. Djokovic relied on his strong forehand play to turn his dream into reality and win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe heartbreak that Djokovic suffered in the Wimbledon final last month at the hands of Alcaraz became a distant memory.

After all, if there was one tennis match Djokovic could have picked to win at the start of the year, it wouldn't have been the Wimbledon final.\n\nJust 21 days later, an inspired Djokovic earned revenge and ended his long quest for a first Olympic gold medal, defeating Alcaraz 7-6 (3) 7-6 (2) in an all-time final at Roland Garros.\n\nAt 37 and at his fifth Olympics, Djokovic captured the one title that had far so long evaded him to complete the career golden slam. Two months after tearing his meniscus in his right knee and appearing to be a doubt for the Olympics when he underwent surgery, Djokovic returned to the same court on Philippe-Chatier to record one of the greatest victories of his career against his young rival, delivering a gold medal for Serbia that will rank highly among his record 24 grand slam titles.\n\nIn doing so, he managed to suppress Alcaraz just as the Spaniard was appearing to be a level above what Djokovic was able to produce at this stage of his career. Djokovic dug deep into his reserves, first denying and then outlasting Alcaraz in an titanic 93-minute opening set. Djokovic withstood Alcaraz's powers of athleticism and shot-making in an epic last stand that displayed a vintage look at his greatest qualities as a tennis player. Djokovic endured, remaining solid in all aspects of his game, and delivered when the biggest moments arrived to claim a historic victory in one of the most memorable Olympics finals ever staged.\n\nAnd with 10 Australian Opens, three French Opens, seven Wimbledon, four US Opens, seven ATP Finals, 40 ATP 1000 titles, Djokovic now has the Olympic gold to tick the final box that was missing in his career. By becoming just the fifth player to complete the career grand slam in singles, he joins Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi, Serena Williams and Steffi Graf to claim another major milestone.

With the name Djokovic echoing around the stadium, the Serbian climbed the stairs and went into the stands to celebrate with his family. After Djokovic's 7-6, 7-6 win in the gold medal match, the emotions got the better of Alcaraz as he settled for the silver medal.\n\nAlso Read | Hockey India Highlights 'Umpiring' and 'Decision-Making' Concerns at Paris Olympics 2024, Points Out Amit Rohidas' Red Card Among Others in Indian Men's Hockey Team's Quarterfinal Win Over Great Britain.\n\nNow after this win, he has won 24 Grand Slam titles, the most by anyone across both men's and women's tennis. Djokovic has won 10 Australian Open titles, three French Open titles, seven Wimbledon titles and four US Open titles.\n\nBesides all this, he now finally has an Olympic gold medal, which is required for a player to complete a career golden slam.\n\nAside from his dominance at Grand Slam level, Djokovic has a total of 72 big titles in tennis. After spending years trying to catch up with stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he has outshined them to become the leader of the modern-day 'Big Three' in tennis. This includes 40 ATP Masters titles as well and seven ATP Finals championship titles.\n\nNadal is second among the 'Big Three', with a total of 59 big titles, including 22 Grand Slams, which also includes a record 14 French Open titles, 36 ATP Masters titles and one Olympic gold medal in singles competition.\n\nFederer is at number three, with 20 Grand Slam titles, including a record eight Wimbledon titles, 28 ATP Masters titles and six ATP Finals titles. This all combines and makes 54 big titles. He has no Olympic singles gold medal though, having one silver medal in the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBesides Djokovic, no other player has won an Olympic singles gold, Grand Slams and all nine ATP Masters 1000 titles.\n\nNotably, Djokovic won all four grand slams in 2021 but failed to touch the rare feat of winning all four grand slams as well as the Olympic gold. Fast forward three years later, the Serbian legend finally has his hands on the elusive gold.\n\nThe blockbuster gold medal clash had its fair share of highlights, with Alcaraz flaunting his ace and Djokovic shinning with his precision.\n\nIn a neck-to-neck battle, Djokovic sealed the first game and stood inches away from breaking Alcaraz's serve.\n\nThroughout the first set, fierce rallies unfolded with Alcaraz, quick as lightning, pulling off slapshots backhand and forehand shots from his arsenal. Djokovic relied on using the court to his advantage and negating the threat that Alacaraz carried.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic stood steps away from breaking each other's serve numerous times. Eventually, Djokovic managed to take away Alcaraz's advantage during the breakpoint and smiled. Each time Alcaraz denied the Serbian to go ahead in the game, the Spaniard was more aggressive and animated in his reaction.\n\nWith the first set level at 6-6, the game went into a tiebreak. Djokovic took the first point after Alcaraz's attempt to slice a forehand shot went wide.\n\nThe Spaniard fought back to take the next point. The duo seemed inseparable until Djokovic upped the ante to take four consecutive points to seal the first set in his favour.\n\nIn the second set, the uncanny resemblance to the opening set continued to keep the packed audience in a state of trance.\n\nDjokovic ensured that Alcaraz had no room to get close to the net and take control of their intense rallies. The second set featured some delightful rallies, forcing the fans to stand on their feet and appreciate the spectacle that the two produced. Drop shot was a common theme throughout those rallies, which was used by both tennis stars to overcome each other.\n\nWith the second set, going right down the wire at 6-6, Alcaraz needed to take the second set home to keep his hopes of standing at the top of the podium alive.Djokovic raced to a 2-0 lead but Alcaraz fought back to level the scoreline. Djokovic relied on his strong forehand play to turn his dream into reality and win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe heartbreak that Djokovic suffered in the Wimbledon final last month at the hands of Alcaraz became a distant memory.

Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as -- no, make that more than -- every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier's red clay at the end and why his tears flowed.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,\" said Djokovic, who didn't drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. \"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.\"\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\n\"In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,\" said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. \"That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.\"\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him -- and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nUntil getting Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Djokovic said, \"I was ready.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic -- and the \"highest mountain to climb at the moment,\" in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, Alcaraz -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\"\n\nYet the place was as quiet as a theater between points; play was delayed briefly when a young child's crying pierced the air that was thick with anticipation.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tiebreaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person",

Two all-time great players matching each other's level for a long stretch, and arguably nearly an entire match.\n\nFrom the first balls Sunday afternoon, it was clear that Djokovic and Alcaraz had come to play -- and nothing less than their highest intensity would do. This wasn't always a contest of the best technical level, with a few flubs and lazily errant returns on important points. But it was a contest: bruising, captivating, and at times, reaching the peaks that only these two can hope to ascend, pretty much when playing each other.\n\nIt was far removed from the Wimbledon final last month, when Djokovic, 39 days removed from knee surgery, came out flat and Alcaraz blew him off the court.\n\nIt was far removed from the last time these two played on Court Philippe-Chatrier at Roland Garros, in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open. That time, Alcaraz came out filled with nerves, played a tough but shaky second set, then succumbed to nerves and cramps. Djokovic won in four.\n\nOn Sunday, the Alcaraz who blasts nearly every backhand and forehand he can and mixes in the world's softest and most deceptive drop shot came out. The Djokovic who chases down more balls than anyone, and gets them back with the quality that switches him from defense to offense in a blink, came out too. This was a case of shared intensity raising things up, less so than shared stakes. Alcaraz has many more Olympic Games in him; this is likely Djokovic's last.\n\nThey matched pressure serves. They traded drop-shot returns that traveled nearly parallel to the net. Djokovic moaned with effort when a chance arose. The only way Alcaraz could survive was with one of high-decibel grunting forehands that lashed into the deepest corner of the court.\n\nThe first set lasted 93 minutes. What did it take for Djokovic to prevail? Nothing less than one of his signature, mistake-free tiebreakers and a lunging forehand drop volley that not even perhaps the fastest player in the game bothered to chase. He repeated the trick in the second set, with two screaming forehands into the corners.\n\nThe Wimbledon 2023 final was a five-set thriller that had them taking turns of being at their best, rather than matching each other's heights, even if not their highest. This was more reminiscent of their Cincinnati final last August, a three-set, four-hour sweatfest that Djokovic won in championship-deciding tiebreak.\n\nMatt Futterman\n\nAfter the Wimbledon final, Djokovic was largely sanguine about how soundly he had been beaten, saying that Alcaraz was simply better in every department. He did have one point of surprise: just how well Alcaraz had served.\n\nThat same quality -- and more visibly, speed -- wasn't quite there at Roland Garros, but Alcaraz compensated by using body serves to reliable effect, especially in pressure moments, saving three break points in a game in the first set. He then used his kick serve to the ad-side to draw short balls out of Djokovic, crunching forehands into the open court.\n\nDjokovic, by contrast, was relying on the precision of his placement, particularly swinging serves down the T when serving to the advantage court, which Alcaraz struggled to return. But the real battle was on the deuce side, between Djokovic's wide serve and Alcaraz's deep return position. Djokovic could reliably extract a playable ball out of the Alcaraz forehand, striking it on the rise into the open court.\n\nUntil, he couldn't. In the dramatic 4-4 game that would eventually propel him to the first set, Djokovic came in off that tactic at 30-30, and flubbed an overhead back to Alcaraz. He lost the point.\n\nAt 40-40, he went to the well again, but hesitated in coming in behind the forehand, allowing Alcaraz to laser a ball back deep and draw an error. And then at deuce again, he hit the forehand with little conviction, the ball rearing up off the tape for Alcaraz to dispatch. Slightly chastened, Djokovic kept playing the pattern, but was less vociferous in moving in behind the ball.\n\nDjokovic brought in something different as a result. Able to use Alcaraz's scarcely believable foot speed against him, he peppered the Spaniard with balls back behind his backhand, feeding off Alcaraz's ability to anticipate and retrieve a ball into the open court.\n\nJames Hansen\n\nIt's incredible to think that a player with 24 Grand Slam titles could ever suffer from doubts about his abilities, but few great players have ever been as honest about confidence demons as Djokovic.\n\nIt doesn't take much, in a sport with so much mental strife: Djokovic came by his doubts honestly heading into Sunday's final. He hadn't won a tournament all year and had never won a gold medal. Alcaraz had won the last two Grand Slam titles and Djokovic knew he hadn't played at his level or even at Jannik Sinner's since last fall, a lifetime ago in tennis. They have been setting the standard in the sport. Not him.\n\nBut late Friday night, after winning his semifinal against Lorenzo Musetti, Djokovic, known for having the strongest brain in the game, delivered a masterclass on talking himself into contention and shifting the pressure to Alcaraz.\n\nAlcaraz was clearly the favorite, he said, just as he had ahead of their semifinal at Roland Garros last year, when Alcaraz was the world No. 1 and top seed.\n\n\"He has proven himself to be the best player in the world at the moment,\" Djokovic said of Alcaraz. \"He won Roland Garros, he won Wimbledon, beat me in the finals quite comfortably there, reached the finals without dropping a set.\"\n\nBut then came the pivot and the window into his mind. He was a different player now, he said, three more weeks removed from knee surgery. He was moving and striking the ball better.\n\n\"Not to take anything, of course away from his win in Wimbledon finals,\" he said. \"He was dominating and deservedly a winner. But I feel more confident about myself and my chances in the finals.\"\n\nIn other words, the world had completely changed in less than a month, even if it really hadn't.\n\nPlus, it was the Olympics, he said. \"Anybody's game.\"\n\nAnd then it was his, as it hadn't been before. The ball rocketed off his racket throughout, the noise crisp and clean and loud. It was a confidence and a quality not seen since that French Open final in 2023, perhaps the US Open final in the same year.\n\nMatt Futterman\n\nWe'll bring your their on-court quotes and press conference reflections as they come in.\n\n\"It was three hours of great fight, incredible tennis.\n\n\"They were very difficult moments for me... I just couldn't raise my level in the tiebreaks.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_futterman@nytimes.com", "name": "Matthew Futterman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "james_hansen@nytimes.com", "name": "James Hansen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Hansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/08/04110900/GettyImages-2165242951-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Before beating Lorenzo Musetti in Paris on Friday, Djokovic had been 0-3 in Summer Games semifinals, losing to the eventual champion each time -- Rafael Nadal in Beijing, Andy Murray in London, Alexander Zverev in Tokyo.\n\nDjokovic left the 2008 Olympics with a bronze, but he really wanted to improve on that now.\n\n\"I know,\" Musetti said, \"how much it means for (him) to win a gold.\"\n\nAlcaraz is the best thing going right now in the sport, having added his recent Wimbledon triumph to the one that came in June at the French Open, which is contested annually at Roland Garros, the clay-court facility being used for the Paris Games' tennis competition.\n\nIn 2022, he became the first teenager to reach No. 1 in the ATP rankings and now has four Grand Slam titles -- the first man to win at least one on clay, grass and hard courts before age 22.\n\n\"Alcaraz has proven the best player in the world at the moment,\" said Djokovic, who was seeded No. 1 at the Olympics after top-ranked Jannik Sinner withdrew because of tonsillitis.\n\nAlcaraz was seeded No. 2, but other players tend to agree with Djokovic's assessment.\n\n\"It's not a secret that, right now,\" said American Tommy Paul, who lost to the Spanish star in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the Olympics, \"Alcaraz is kind of like the golden standard.\"\n\nWhy the gray sleeve? Djokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a fourth round victory at the French Open on June 3, then had surgery in Paris two days later. Most people figured he would need to skip Wimbledon, which started on July 1, and the Olympics.\n\nNope. He showed up at the All England Club, wearing a gray sleeve on his right knee, and while it took him a few matches to get going, eventually Djokovic looked very much like himself. Until, that is, he took on Alcaraz for the title.\n\nAt the Summer Games, there was only one match where the knee was an issue -- when he felt pain in the second set of a victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals Thursday night. But he put in plenty of work with his physiotherapist between then and his match against Musetti, when all was OK.\n\n\"I feel like I'm a different player than I was in Wimbledon. The way I move. The way I'm striking the ball,\" said Djokovic, who eliminated Nadal in the second round in Paris.\n\n\"I feel more confident about myself and chances in the final\" on Sunday, he said.\n\nWho is the favorite?\n\nAlcaraz is favored to win the men's singles final, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, which lists him with a -250 money line. Djokovic is at +195. If Djokovic manages to win in straight sets, that would pay off at +360.\n\n\"The way he's playing,\" Djokovic said, \"he's definitely a favorite.\"\n\nHow to watch\n\nThe men's final is scheduled to be the second match at Court Philippe Chatrier on Sunday and won't start before 2 p.m. local time (8 a.m. EDT). To find the right channel, check NBC's online schedule.\n\nHead-to-head record\n\nThey have met a total of six times previously and each man has won three of those matches.\n\nThe only time they played at Court Philippe Chatrier was in the 2023 French Open semifinals. Djokovic won that one 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 when Alcaraz succumbed to full-body cramps during the last two sets.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to

Djokovic took down his Wimbledon nemesis Carlos Alcaraz on Court Phillipe-Chatrier at Roland Garros. The veteran has won his maiden gold at the Olympics and second medal (bronze in 2008 Beijing). He also became the oldest gold medal winner in tennis singles at the Olympics.\n\nAlcaraz has raced to a 38-7 win-loss record on the ATP Tour this season. He had won three titles before the Olympics. The young Spaniard, who is 18-3 at Roland Garros (French Open), owns a 59-10 win-loss record overall at Grand Slams, including 18-1 this season. Alcaraz was on a 12-match unbeaten run at Roland Garros (French Open and Olympic silver).\n\nDjokovic owns a 96-16 win-loss record at Roland Garros (French Open). He has already bagged three French Open honors. He holds the record for the most Grand Slams won in men's singles (24). By winning his quarter-final clash in 2024 Paris, he completed 100 wins at Roland Garros (now 102). Djokovic owns a 29-7 win-loss record this season on the ATP Tour.\n\nAlcaraz took down Hady Habib of Lebanon in the first round, winning 6-3, 6-1. Netherlands' Tallon Griekspoor was Alcaraz next scalp (6-1, 7-6). Roman Safiullin, who was under the Individual Neutral Athletes category, was beaten 6-4, 6-2. Alcaraz beat USA's Tommy Paul 6-4, 7-6 in the quarters. Alcaraz dispatched Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-1, 6-1 next. And now, Djokovic took down Alcaraz 7-6, 7-6.\n\nDjokovic took down Matthew Ebden in the first round, winning 6-0, 6-1. In the second round, the Serb beat arch-rival Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4. In the 3rd round, Djokovic beat Germany's Dominic Koepfer 7-5, 6-3. Djokovic won his quarter-final clash against Stefanos Tsitsipas (6-3, 7-6). Djokovic beat eventual bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti in the semis (6-4, 6-2). He beat Alcaraz in the final.\n\nDjokovic has completed a Career Golden Slam by winning the 2024 Paris Olympics gold. The Golden Slam is someone who wins all four career Grand Slams and the Olympic gold. Among singles in tennis, Djokovic joins the likes of Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Stefi Graff and Serena Williams.\n\nThe two players came into this match with a 3-3 win-loss record each in their head-to-head meetings. Alcaraz took down Djokovic twice at the Wimbledon finals. He also beat him at ATP Masters 1000 Madrid in 2022. Djokovic beat Alacaraz in the semis at Roland Garros in 2023. He also beat Alcaraz in the final of ATP Masters 1000 Cincinnati and ATP Finals semis.\n\nAs per Opta, Alcaraz became the second-youngest men's singles finalist at the Olympic Games in tennis history, older only than Robert LeRoy in St. Louis 1904. Later on, Djokovic became the 3rd player to reach the Olympic final in singles after having turned 30 since tennis returned to the Summer Olympic program in 1988. He joined Roger Federer (2012) and Serena Williams (2012).", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With the name Djokovic echoing around the stadium, the Serbian climbed the stairs and went into the stands to celebrate with his family. After Djokovic's 7-6, 7-6 win in the gold medal match, the emotions got the better of Alcaraz as he settled for the silver medal.\n\nAlso Read | Hockey India Highlights 'Umpiring' and 'Decision-Making' Concerns at Paris Olympics 2024, Points Out Amit Rohidas' Red Card Among Others in Indian Men's Hockey Team's Quarterfinal Win Over Great Britain.\n\nNow after this win, he has won 24 Grand Slam titles, the most by anyone across both men's and women's tennis. Djokovic has won 10 Australian Open titles, three French Open titles, seven Wimbledon titles and four US Open titles.\n\nBesides all this, he now finally has an Olympic gold medal, which is required for a player to complete a career golden slam.\n\nAside from his dominance at Grand Slam level, Djokovic has a total of 72 big titles in tennis. After spending years trying to catch up with stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he has outshined them to become the leader of the modern-day 'Big Two' in tennis. This includes 40 ATP Masters titles as well and seven ATP Finals championship titles.\n\nNadal is second among the 'Big Three', with a total of 59 big titles, including 22 Grand Slams, which also includes a record 14 French Open titles, 36 ATP Masters titles and one Olympic gold medal in singles competition.\n\nFederer is at number three, with 20 Grand Slam titles, including a record eight Wimbledon titles, 28 ATP Masters titles and six ATP Finals titles. This all combines and makes 54 big titles. He has no Olympic singles gold medal though, having one silver medal in the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBesides Djokovic, no other player has won an Olympic singles gold, Grand Slams and all nine ATP Masters 1000 titles.\n\nNotably, Djokovic won all four grand slams in 2021 but failed to touch the rare feat of winning all four grand slams as well as the Olympic gold. Fast forward three years later, the Serbian legend finally has his hands on the elusive gold.\n\nThe blockbuster gold medal clash had its fair share of highlights, with Alcaraz flaunting his ace and Djokovic shinning with his precision.\n\nIn a neck-to-neck battle, Djokovic sealed the first game and stood inches away from breaking Alcaraz's serve.\n\nThroughout the first set, fierce rallies unfolded with Alcaraz, quick as lightning, pulling off slapshots backhand and forehand shots from his arsenal. Djokovic relied on using the court to his advantage and negating the threat that Alacaraz carried.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic stood steps away from breaking each other's serve numerous times. Eventually, Djokovic managed to take away Alcaraz's advantage during the breakpoint and smiled. Each time Alcaraz denied the Serbian to go ahead in the game, the Spaniard was more aggressive and animated in his reaction.\n\nWith the first set level at 6-6, the game went into a tiebreak. Djokovic took the first point after Alcaraz's attempt to slice a forehand shot went wide.\n\nThe Spaniard fought back to take the next point. The duo seemed inseparable until Djokovic upped the ante to take four consecutive points to seal the first set in his favour.\n\nIn the second set, the uncanny resemblance to the opening set continued to keep the packed audience in a state of trance.\n\nDjokovic ensured that Alcaraz had no room to get close to the net and take control of their intense rallies. The second set featured some delightful rallies, forcing the fans to stand on their feet and appreciate the spectacle that the two produced. Drop shot was a common theme throughout those rallies, which was used by both tennis stars to overcome each other.\n\nWith the second set, going right down the wire at 6-6, Alcaraz needed to take the second set home to keep his hopes of standing at the top of the podium alive.Djokovic raced to a 2-0 lead but Alcaraz fought back to level the scoreline. Djokovic relied on his strong forehand play to turn his dream into reality and win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe heartbreak that Djokovic suffered in the Wimbledon final last month at the hands of Alcaraz became a distant memory.

This triumph marks a significant milestone in his already illustrious career, solidifying his status as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.\n\nThe match was a showcase of exceptional talent, with both Djokovic and Alcaraz displaying extraordinary skill and athleticism. The two-hour, 50-minute encounter was a fitting climax to an unforgettable Olympic tournament.\n\nDjokovic's impressive career already featured a record 24 Grand Slam titles and the most weeks spent at No. 1 in the rankings by any man or woman. It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he has made clear that simply was not sufficient.\n\nCompeting in his fifth Olympic Games, Djokovic overcame Alcaraz in an enthralling final at Roland Garros to add Olympic gold to his 24 Grand Slam triumphs.\n\n\"This is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had and the most special feeling,\" said the 37-year-old said.\n\n\"I thought carrying the flag at the opening ceremony for my country at the 2012 Olympics was the best feeling an athlete could have until today. Now, at the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had.\"\n\nVictory on Sunday allowed Djokovic to join Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Steffi Graf, and the watching Serena Williams as the only players to win all four Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic singles gold, completing the career Golden Slam.\n\nBefore defeating Alcaraz on Sunday, his best performance at the Olympics had been in 2008 in Beijing when he won bronze. He had also lost three semi-finals.\n\nDjokovic is the oldest singles champion since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, and he shattered Alcaraz's bid to add gold to the French Open and Wimbledon titles he has already pocketed this summer.", "source": {"uri": "businessday.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Businessday NG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_nlebem@businessday.ng", "name": "Anthony Nlebem", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Novak-Djokovic-Olympics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

After all, if there was one tennis match Djokovic could have picked to win at the start of the year, it wouldn't have been the Wimbledon final.\n\nJust 21 days later, an inspired Djokovic earned revenge and ended his long quest for a first Olympic gold medal, defeating Alcaraz 7-6 (3) 7-6 (2) in an all-time final at Roland Garros.\n\nAt 37 and at his fifth Olympics, Djokovic captured the one title that had far so long evaded him to complete the career golden slam. Two months after tearing his meniscus in his right knee and appearing to be a doubt for the Olympics when he underwent surgery, Djokovic returned to the same court on Philippe-Chatier to record one of the greatest victories of his career against his young rival, delivering a gold medal for Serbia that will rank highly among his record 24 grand slam titles.\n\nIn doing so, he managed to suppress Alcaraz just as the Spaniard was appearing to be a level above what Djokovic was able to produce at this stage of his career. Djokovic dug deep into his reserves, first denying and then outlasting Alcaraz in an titanic 93-minute opening set. Djokovic withstood Alcaraz's powers of athleticism and shot-making in an epic last stand that displayed a vintage look at his greatest qualities as a tennis player. Djokovic endured, remaining solid in all aspects of his game, and delivered when the biggest moments arrived to claim a historic victory in one of the most memorable Olympics finals ever staged.\n\nAnd with 10 Australian Opens, three French Opens, seven Wimbledon, four US Opens, seven ATP Finals, 40 ATP 1000 titles, Djokovic now has the Olympic gold to tick the final box that was missing in his career. By becoming just the fifth player to complete the career grand slam in singles, he joins Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi, Serena Williams and Steffi Graf to claim another major milestone. Djokovic needed to be at his very best to beat Alcaraz and with history on the line, but found a level that had looked beyond him for much of the season.

Thank God. I am super proud, super happy.\"\n\nHe also celebrated his moment by holding the Serbian flag in his hand with pride.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam Champion was down on his knees and tears of joy fell from his eyes after taking the game point. With the name Djokovic echoing around the stadium, the Serbian climbed the stairs and went into the stands to celebrate with his family. After Djokovic's 7-6, 7-6 win in the gold medal match, the emotions got the better of Alcaraz as he settled for the silver medal.\n\nNow after this win, he has won 24 Grand Slam titles, the most by anyone across both men's and women's tennis. Djokovic has won 10 Australian Open titles, three French Open titles, seven Wimbledon titles and four US Open titles.\n\nBesides all this, he now finally has an Olympic gold medal, which is required for a player to complete a career golden slam.\n\nAside from his dominance at Grand Slam level, Djokovic has a total of 72 big titles in tennis. After spending years trying to catch up with stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he has outshined them to become the leader of the modern-day 'Big Three' in tennis. This includes 40 ATP Masters titles as well and seven ATP Finals championship titles.\n\nNadal is second among the 'Big Three', with a total of 59 big titles, including 22 Grand Slams, which also includes a record 14 French Open titles, 36 ATP Masters titles and one Olympic gold medal in singles competition.\n\nFederer is at number three, with 20 Grand Slam titles, including a record eight Wimbledon titles, 28 ATP Masters titles and six ATP Finals titles. This all combines and make 54 big titles. He has no Olympic singles gold medal though, having one silver medal in the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nThe blockbuster gold medal clash had its fair share of highlights, with Alcaraz flaunting his ace and Djokovic shinning with his precision.\n\nIn a neck-to-neck battle, Djokovic sealed the first game and stood inches away from breaking Alcaraz's serve.\n\nThroughout the first set, fierce rallies unfolded with Alcaraz, quick as lightning, pulling off slapshots backhand and forehand shots from his arsenal. Djokovic relied on using the court to his advantage and negating the threat that Alacaraz carried.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic stood steps away from breaking each other's serve numerous times. Eventually, Djokovic managed to take away Alcaraz's advantage during the breakpoint and smiled. Each time Alcaraz denied the Serbian to go ahead in the game, the Spaniard was more aggressive and animated in his reaction.\n\nWith the first set level at 6-6, the game went into a tiebreak. Djokovic took the first point after Alcaraz's attempt to slice a forehand shot went wide.\n\nThe Spaniard fought back to take the next point. The duo seemed inseparable until Djokovic upped the ante to take four consecutive points to seal the first set in his favour.\n\nIn the second set, the uncanny resemblance to the opening set continued to keep the packed audience in a state of trance.\n\nDjokovic ensured that Alcaraz had no room to get close to the net and take control of their intense rallies. The second set featured some delightful rallies, forcing the fans to stand on their feet and appreciate the spectacle that the two produced. Drop shot was a common theme throughout those rallies, which was used by both tennis stars to overcome each other.\n\nWith the second set going right down the wire at 6-6, Alcaraz needed to take the second set home to keep his hopes of standing at the top of the podium alive.\n\nDjokovic raced to a 2-0 lead but Alcaraz fought back to level the scoreline. Djokovic relied on his strong forehand play to turn his dream into reality and win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe heartbreak that Djokovic suffered in the Wimbledon final last month at the hands of Alcaraz became a distant memory.\n\nAlso Read: Will Perform Better Next Time: Indian Archer Ankita Bhakat On Missing Medal At Paris Olympics 2024\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not

It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he has made clear that simply was not sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets. Now Djokovic is the oldest man to win the singles gold in his sport since 1908 -- and prevented Spain's Alcaraz, who is 21, from becoming the youngest.\n\nWhen the victory was his, when the gold was his, thanks to one last forehand winner, Djokovic turned toward his team in the stands -- sitting in front of his wife and their two children -- and dropped his racket as he knelt on the clay. As emotional as ever, he cried and covered his face, then rose and grabbed a red-white-and-blue Serbian flag. After hugs in the stands, Djokovic waved that flag. Alcaraz wept afterward, too.\n\nThe final, which lasted 2 hours, 50 minutes despite being decided in only two sets, was a rematch of the Wimbledon title match three weeks ago that Alcaraz won to follow up his French Open title in June.\n\nAlcaraz also defeated Djokovic in last year's final at the All England Club, but Djokovic won when they met in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open, the annual clay-court tournament held at Roland Garros, the site used for tennis during these Olympics.\n\nSunday's contest was an enthralling matchup, featuring one of the best to ever do it in Djokovic, and the best at the moment in Alcaraz. Indeed, could have been frustrating for Djokovic to find himself once again across the net from a younger, speedier version of himself. Maybe that's why Djokovic frequently looked up and gesticulated and muttered toward his guest box.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nStill, he came out on top.\n\nIt required long exchanges filled with superb ball-striking at the baseline, deft drop shots -- Alcaraz's tended to be more successful, sometimes so good Djokovic declined to even give chase -- and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense at both ends. They served so well that neither got broken even once: Djokovic saved eight break points, Alcaraz six.\n\nMost remarkable, perhaps, was how cleanly both men played, despite the talent of the opposition and pressure of the occasion. Unforced errors were rare.\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, the loser -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Make no mistake, this encounter between the No. 1-seeded Djokovic and No. 2-seeded Alcaraz was worthy of a major final, and no one fortunate enough to hold a ticket could complain about not getting their money's worth.\n\nThose in the stands became part of the show, repeatedly breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. In the second set, as Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters began chanting, \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\") while shaking their red-and-yellow flags. Chair umpire Damien Dumusois occasionally reminded folks to remain silent during the action.\n\nYet it also became as quiet as a theater between points, enough so that play was delayed briefly in the first set when the air thick with anticipation was pierced by a young child's crying.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBoth men played to the crowd. When Alcaraz raced to reach one drop shot and deposit it over the net for a winner, he basked in the raucous reaction by pointing his right index finger to his ear. When Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point to lead 3-2 in the second tiebreaker, he waved both arms overhead to encourage folks who already were on their feet, screaming.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, chock full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes, including five break chances for Alcaraz, before Djokovic managed to hold for a 5-4 lead. In the tiebreaker, Djokovic was superior in crunch time, as he so often is, taking the last four points.\n\nAt 3-all, Alcaraz delivered a body serve, but Djokovic slid just enough to his left to smack a cross-court forehand return winner. After two mistakes by Alcaraz, Djokovic produced a volley winner and turned to face his family with a fist held high.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source":

Not only that, but the Serbian tennis star also became just the fifth player in tennis history to complete the Golden Slam (Winning all four major championships and a gold medal), a career achievement that had previously eluded Djokovic.\n\nAnd it was instantly apparent just how much the win meant to Djokovic, who with tears flying, put his head in his hands in disbelief before shaking hands with Alcaraz, then collapsed onto Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nSo emotional was Djokovic that his hands were shaking as he knelt on the court at Roland Garros.\n\nThen, in a truly special moment, Djokovic celebrated the gold medal victory with his family.\n\nIt's rare to see Djokovic this emotional, but it's rare to see a victory mean so much to a player with seemingly little else to conquer in the sport.\n\nDjokovic, with 24 major championship wins, is the most decorated men's tennis player of all-time. But after 16 years of waiting, including a bronze medal win at Beijing in 2008 and three straight Olympics of falling shy of the medal stand, Djokovic finally got his gold.\n\nWhen asked if it was the missing piece to the puzzle in his career, Djokovic had this to say.\n\n\"Yes it is,\" Djokovic said. \"It is. I'm telling myself always that I am enough. Because I can be very self-critical. I don't know. That's one of the biggest internal battles I keep on fighting with myself.\"\n\n\"That I feel like I haven't done enough or been enough in my life on and off the court. So it's a big lesson for me. I'm super grateful for the blessing to win a historic gold medal for my country. To complete the golden slam. To complete all the records.\"\n\nWhen asked if it was all enough, the slams, the medals, the countless iconic moments he produced, Djokovic simply said, \"I think so.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_635,h_357,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/si/01j4f0neghmbg4btxwwr.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

I did it for my country first, for Serbia.\"\n\nIn a raucous atmosphere, with soccer-style chants shattering the calm of the adjacent Bois de Boulogne, neither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest.\n\nThe first set alone lasted one hour 33 minutes as the two wrestled for control in a series of spellbinding games, one at 4-4 in which Djokovic repelled five break points.\n\nAlcaraz blinked first in the tiebreak to allow Djokovic to move ahead and when another tiebreak was required to decide the second set, again Djokovic found inspiration, moving 6-2 in front and sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner.\n\nDjokovic roared to the sky and after consoling a crestfallen Alcaraz at the net, then fell to his knees and sobbed into the Parisian clay in the centre of the court before climbing into the crowd where he was swamped by his family, friends and team.\n\nWhile Djokovic became the oldest Olympic singles champion since tennis returned to the Games in 1988, the 21-year-old Alcaraz looked inconsolable after failing to add the gold medal to this year's French Open and Wimbledon crowns.\n\n\"I think I did a really great tournament, I think I did a really great match,\" the four-time Grand Slam champion said. \"Obviously in front of me, I had a really hungry Novak.\"\n\nDjokovic had lost three times in Olympic singles semi-finals with a solitary bronze medal to show from four previous Games.\n\nHe knew Paris was his last realistic chance to fill the remaining space in a bulging trophy cabinet containing 24 Grand Slam titles. And how he earned it -- overturning a crushing loss to Alcaraz three weeks ago in the Wimbledon final to become the first man to win the Olympic singles title without dropping a set.\n\nDjokovic joins an elite group of Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams, the latter watching from the front row, in the Golden Slam club, and many will say this settled the G.O.A.T argument once and for all.\n\nIt takes something pretty special to upstage the men's 100 metres final taking place later at the Stade de France, but this near three-hour red-dirt duel arguably came close.\n\nThe opening four games spanned 30 mesmerizing minutes, every rally a battle of skill and wills. Alcaraz saved three break points in the fourth game and looked menacing as he threw everything in his arsenal at Djokovic as the Serb served at 4-4.\n\nSeveral times Djokovic could only smile at the athleticism of his opponent who piled on the pressure to earn five break points, and somehow he survived.\n\nAlcaraz saved a set point at 5-6 but the Spaniard's level dipped in the tiebreak and Djokovic pounced to grab the lead. Sensing his moment, Djokovic's intensity went even higher deep in the second set but Alcaraz hung on.\n\nDjokovic was relentless though and an outrageous forehand winner at 2-2 in the breaker snapped Alcaraz's resistance and the end then came quickly as he claimed the 99th, and perhaps most valuable, title of his glittering career.\n\nA memorable week ended with Italy's Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini beating Russian neutral players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider 2-6 6-1 (10-7) to win the women's gold, adding to compatriot Lorenzo Musetti's men's singles bronze.\n\n(Reporting by Martyn Herman; additional reporting by Sybille de la Hamaide; Editing by Alison Williams, Toby Davis and Hugh Lawson)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bois_de_Boulogne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bois de Boulogne"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Shnaider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana Shnaider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Errani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sara Errani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theprint_default_image_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Forbes estimated Djokovic made $38.4 million from August 2022 to 2023, while Alcaraz made $31.4 million over the same period. Both athletes made the majority of their money off the court: Djokovic drew in about $25 million from deals with Asics, Lacoste, Waterdrop beverages and more, and about $20 million of Alcaraz' earnings came off the court through sponsorships with the likes of Louis Vuitton and Calvin Klein.\n\nWhile Djokovic was the No. 1 seed in Paris, there were concerns about his knee injury that led him to withdraw from the French Open and get surgery in June. On Thursday after he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals, the Serbian tennis star said he was \"very worried\" about his injury and didn't know how it would impact him the rest of the games. Alcaraz was also playing with an injury in Paris after suffering a groin injury during his second round win last Monday. After the match, he said he had been dealing with the pain since Wimbledon in early July. Djokovic and Alcaraz had played just once at Paris' Roland Garros before Sunday's match, competing at the French Open in 2023 in a semifinal match that went to Djokovic.\n\n6. That's how many times prior to Sunday's match the two top players in the world had played. Of those, Djokovic has three wins and Alcaraz has three wins.\n\nTo get to the gold, Djokovic beat Spain's Rafael Nadal, who is often hailed as one the best tennis players in the world -- though was not seeded in Paris -- alongside Djokovic and Roger Federer. Djokovic dominated Nadal 6-1 and 6-4 earlier this week, though Nadal still leads 8-3 when the pair has played at Roland Garros.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vuitton", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louis Vuitton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacoste", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lacoste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Klein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Klein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Tsitsipas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefanos Tsitsipas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66af99d6ae67dd743884ba42/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1680,945,x0,y15,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-01", "dateEnd": "-06-04", "textStart": 2064, "textEnd": 2075}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he has made clear that simply was not sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.

However, the Olympic gold medal had remained out of his grasp until the Paris Games.\n\nThe 37-year-old Serbian faced off against Carlos Alcaraz, the rising star from Spain, in the gold medal match. Alcaraz, who had defeated Djokovic in the Wimbledon final just weeks before the Olympics, was eager to prove himself against the tennis legend once again.\n\nThe match was a nail-biting affair, with both players showcasing their exceptional skills and determination. Djokovic, known for his mental resilience and strategic prowess, managed to edge out Alcaraz in two closely contested sets, winning 7-6(3), 7-6(2).\n\nThe victory was particularly significant for Djokovic, as it completed his collection of major titles. He is now one of only five players in history to achieve the \"Golden Slam,\" which includes winning all four Grand Slam tournaments and an Olympic gold medal. The other players to have achieved this feat are Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, and Serena Williams.\n\nNovak Djokovi's Olympic triumph was even more remarkable considering the challenges he faced leading up to the Games. He had suffered a knee injury during the French Open, which required surgery and forced him to take a break from the sport. Many doubted whether he would be able to recover in time for the Olympics, but Djokovic proved his doubters wrong with his exceptional performance in Paris.\n\nThe Serbian's victory was met with an outpouring of emotion, both from Djokovic himself and from his fans around the world. After the match, Djokovic was seen lying on the court, overcome with joy and relief. He later described the win as \"one of the happiest moments of my career.\"\n\nDjokovic's Olympic gold medal win also solidified his status as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. While his Grand Slam titles have long been a testament to his skill and dominance, the Olympic gold medal adds another layer of prestige to his already impressive resume.\n\nThe significance of Djokovic's victory extends beyond his personal achievements. It also represents a major milestone for Serbian tennis, as Djokovic is the first player from his country to win an Olympic gold medal in tennis. His success has inspired a new generation of Serbian tennis players and has helped to raise the profile of the sport in the country.\n\nAs Djokovic stood on the podium, clutching his gold medal, he was filled with gratitude for the opportunity to represent his country on the Olympic stage. \"This is a dream come true for me,\" he said. \"To win an Olympic gold medal for Serbia is something I will cherish for the rest of my life.\"\n\nNovak Djokovic's Olympic gold medal win is a testament to his unwavering dedication, perseverance, and love for the sport of tennis. It is a fitting conclusion to a career that has already cemented his place in the annals of tennis history. As he looks ahead to the future, Djokovic can take pride in knowing that he has achieved the ultimate goal in his sport and has left an indelible mark on the game of tennis.", "source": {"uri": "bbntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbntimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nitish_mathur@bbntimes.com", "name": "Nitish Mathur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.bbntimes.com/images/articles/society/Novak_Djokovic_Wins_Historic_Olympic_Gold_Medal_at_Paris_2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

With the name Djokovic echoing around the stadium, the Serbian climbed the stairs and went into the stands to celebrate with his family. After Djokovic's 7-6, 7-6 win in the gold medal match, the emotions got the better of Alcaraz as he settled for the silver medal.\n\nNotably, Djokovic had won all four grand slams in 2021 but failed to touch a rare feat of winning all four grand slams as well as the Olympic gold.

Djokovic relied on using the court to his advantage and negating the threat that Alacaraz carried.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic stood steps away from breaking each other's serve numerous times. Eventually, Djokovic managed to take away Alcaraz's advantage during the breakpoint and smiled. Each time Alcaraz denied the Serbian to go ahead in the game, the Spaniard was more aggressive and animated in his reaction.\n\nWith the first set level at 6-6, the game went into a tiebreak. Djokovic took the first point after Alcaraz's attempt to slice a forehand shot went wide.\n\nThe Spaniard fought back to take the next point. The duo seemed inseparable until Djokovic upped the ante to take four consecutive points to seal the first set in his favour.\n\nIn the second set, the uncanny resemblance to the opening set continued to keep the packed audience in a state of trance.\n\nDjokovic ensured that Alcaraz had no room to get close to the net and take control of their intense rallies. The second set featured some delightful rallies, forcing the fans to stand on their feet and appreciate the spectacle that the two produced. Drop shot was a common theme throughout those rallies, which was used by both tennis stars to overcome each other.\n\nWith the second set, going right down the wire at 6-6, Alcaraz needed to take the second set home to keep his hopes of standing at the top of the podium alive.\n\nDjokovic raced to a 2-0 lead but Alcaraz fought back to level the scoreline. Djokovic relied on his strong forehand play to turn his dream into reality and win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe heartbreak that Djokovic suffered in the Wimbledon final last month at the hands of Alcaraz became a distant memory.

The elusive trophy had been claimed. At 37-years-old, he was the Olympic champion in the men's singles tennis competition. The triumph for himself and Serbia came 16 years after winning bronze at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nDjokovic claimed the prize with an intense 7-6, 7-6 victory over Spain's Carlos Alcaraz, the man who beat him in straight sets on 14 July to win the Wimbledon title for a second time at his expense.\n\nBut that was on grass in south-west London. On Court Philippe Chatrier at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, Djokovic had the psychological advantage of a success last year in the semi-final of the French Open.\n\nBilled as a clash of generations, that match fizzled out into a Djokovic stroll as the then 20-year-old Alcaraz suffered with cramps due to the pressure of entering a tournament as world number one and playing a crunch tie against legend of the sport.\n\nAlcaraz vowed to learn from his four-set defeat. Two Wimbledon titles and a French Open crown suggest an upward curve.\n\nChange\n\nFourteen months on from that French Open meeting, Djokovic and Alcaraz engaged in the gladitoral combat predicted for that sultry afternoon in June 2023.\n\nThe augurs came early. It took them 25 minutes to reach 2-2 in the first set.\n\nJust over an hour later, they were in a tiebreak after Alcaraz saved a set point on his way to levelling at 6-6.\n\nThey changed ends at 3-3 in the shoot-out. But Djokovic was steadier. He clocked up the next four points to pocket the first set after one hour and 33 minutes.\n\n\"I had a hungry Novak in front of me,\" said Alcaraz. \"He played at an impressive level. He did not let me take the chances I had. I gave everything I had on the court.\"\n\nPredictably the match wended its way to another shoot-out. And Djokovic started it with a thunderous forehand cross court winner.\n\nDjokovic unloaded a similar bludgeon to lead 3-2. And Alcaraz had no more answers.\n\nRecord\n\nDjokovic, who has won a record 24 Grand Slam tournaments, moved inexorably towards his grail and concluded the quest with a forehand winner down the line.\n\n\"When I saw that last forehand pass him, the intensity of the emotions that I felt at that moment was just something I never felt on the tennis court before,\" said Djokovic.\n\n\"The fact that I'm 37, I don't know how many more chances I would have had to win gold,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm super thrilled that I managed to do it here in a way that I did it against a guy who is the best in the world at the moment.\"\n\nIt was Serbia's second gold medal of the Paris Games after their win in the mixed team air pistol.\n\n\"Representing my country has been always the greatest priority, an honour for me, whether it's Olympic Games or Davis Cup or anywhere that I can carry proudly the Serbian flag,\" added Djokovic.\n\n\"This is something that really drives me and motivates me like nothing else.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_myers@rfi.fr", "name": "Paul Myers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts":

At 37 years old, two months after surgery to repair a torn meniscus, Djokovic was clearly hobbling and frequently appeared to be in pain. Carlos Alcaraz, who happens to be the best player in the world, taunted Djokovic with drop shots, forcing him to go where his knee did not want to take him. Alcaraz never lost a service game, and he finished 33 with winners, compared to 15 for Djokovic. What he did not finish with was a gold medal.\n\nDjokovic beat Alcaraz, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-2). Djokovic has always been an expressive player, but there were times in this match when he seemed especially frustrated by forces beyond his control. His problem was not hitting shots; it was getting to them. Djokovic is the best in history at seizing control of a point he seems sure to lose. But in this match, there were balls he would normally track down that he didn't even bother to chase-or when he did, he got there later than we have come to expect.\n\nThis sounds contradictory, but it's true: Djokovic did not look his best, yet he played some of his best tennis. Alcaraz summed it up: \"Hungry Novak ... an impressive player today.\" Someday, when Alcaraz's grandkids ask him what made Djokovic great, this performance at Roland Garros would be a fine place to start.\n\nBoth men said afterward that the pressure of the Olympics was even greater than what they feel at Grand Slams. Djokovic said, \"The fact I lost as easy as I did in the finals at Wimbledon probably worked in my favor because I knew that I couldn't do worse than that.\" With the first set in Paris tied 4-4, Djokovic fended off five break points. In both tiebreakers, Djokovic was the superior player. Alcaraz acknowledged that afterward: \"I felt the pressure in those situations, that I couldn't play my best tennis.\"\n\nWhen the match ended, Djokovic seemed as stunned as he was happy-he ended up prone on the ground, face down, his right hand shaking against the clay. When he got up, he found a towel, sat in his chair and covered his sobbing face.\n\n\"I thought that 2012 opening ceremony, carrying the flag for my country, was the best feeling that an athlete could have,\" the best male tennis player in history said Sunday. \"This supersedes everything that I imagined, and everything I hoped I could experience and feel.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Novak Djokovic Goes From Hobbled to Heroic to Win Elusive Olympic Gold Medal.", "source": {"uri": "heraldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_rosenberg@heraldonline.com", "name": "Michael Rosenberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/ff07i5/picture290742064/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/f1babf6c-b452-4684-ab54-53f67f2cf4b5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

That exclusive group also features Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Serena Williams, who was in the stands to witness this pulsating contest.\n\nHow much this triumph meant to Djokovic was immediately evident. Upon winning match point, he roared with delight, dropped to his knees, then tearfully embraced his family and coaching team.\n\nA Serbian flag was soon brought out, and the 37-year-old - the oldest man to win an Olympics singles gold medal - still seemed shaken with joy when he returned to his courtside chair. This is the first title that Djokovic has won all year, but arguably the one he wanted the most.\n\n\"I couldn't be prouder and happier,\" said Djokovic, who won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n\"Playing for Serbia has always been my utmost, real pleasure, my priority ... I'm just so proud to be a part of an elite number of athletes that managed to win gold for their countries in their respective sports.\"\n\nOlympic tennis competitions can be a strange thing, arriving at awkward times in the calendar and often missing some of the sport's top players. This, however, was an exception, a thrilling sequel to Alcaraz's straight-sets victory in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, Djokovic has returned to the court on which he sustained a knee injury while playing at the French Open in June. That seems a lifetime ago now, and one meniscus surgery and one grand slam final later, he has now filled a notable gap in his remarkable trophy cabinet.\n\nStill playing with a brace on his right knee, Djokovic started the match promisingly, creating a break point on Alcaraz's first service game.\n\nThe 21-year-old shut out the opening, which would become a common theme through the early part of the match. Djokovic had five break points in the first set and Alcaraz eight, yet neither man could edge in front.\n\nOr looking at it another way, both seemed to raise their standard when the pressure increased. That was best demonstrated at 2-1 in the first set, with Alcaraz 0-40 down on his own serve. After a quick change of rackets, he reeled off the next three points before wrapping up the game a few points later with an exquisite drop volley.\n\nThe roles reversed several games later. With the set locked at 4-4, Alcaraz's booming forehand heaped the pressure on Djokovic's serve, and the break points came thick and fast - five in that game alone. But the world No. 2 stood firm, roaring to the crowd when a volley winner denied Alcaraz the chance to get ahead.\n\nIt was fitting and probably fair that this absorbing set would be decided by a tie-break, and with the scores locked at 3-3, it was Alcaraz who cracked first. Back-to-back errors handed Djokovic three set points before another cute forehand volley completed the marathon first set in an hour and 33 minutes.\n\nUnsurprisingly, little changed in the second set, only that break points became fewer and farther between.\n\nAs the match wore on, the standard remained unrelentingly high. At 4-4, Djokovic came from 40-0 down to deuce on Alcaraz serve, prompting chants of \"Nol\u00e9! Nol\u00e9!\" from the stands. But Alcaraz had a response, winning a marathon point by sliding a shot past Djokovic at the net, then raising a finger to his ear in celebration.\n\nAn inevitable tie-break followed soon after and, once again, the 24-time grand slam champion's experience and mettle came to the fore.\n\nA stunning cross-court forehand, bringing to an end one of the longest rallies of the match, had the crowd on their feet, and Djokovic didn't lose a point from there. Another forehand winner completed the victory, which was sealed with a huge roar of delight.\n\nThereafter, the emotions flowed freely as Djokovic kissed and hugged his wife and children in the stands. This was only Serbia's second medal of the Games, and the country's sporting talisman had achieved it without dropping a set in the competition.\n\n\"I was so blessed to win everything pretty much there is to win in my sport, but this is something different,\" said Djokovic. \"This supersedes everything that I've ever felt on the tennis court after winning big trophies. It's just incredible joy.\"\n\nAt 21, Alcaraz had been aiming to become the youngest man to win an Olympic singles gold medal. Despite falling short, he played a wonderful role in this spectacle, dazzling the crowd with 25 forehand winners.\n\nHis unforced error count may have cost him - 33 to Djokovic's 25 - as well as an inferiority to his opponent in the two tie-breaks. But heading into the US swing, the world No. 3 can nonetheless reflect on a stellar two-month period: a first French Open title, a second Wimbledon title and now an Olympic silver medal.\n\n\"I'm really happy about my performance today,\" Alcaraz told reporters. \"I'm a little bit disappointed about not playing my best tennis in some situations, in difficult situations. Tie-breaks, for example, he increased his level at the top and I couldn't do it, so probably a bit sad thinking about those moments.\"\n\nIt just happened to be one of those days that Alcaraz found himself up against an opponent who was inspired and determined like never before.\n\n\"In front of me, I had a really angry Novak,\" he added, \"An impressive player today. His level was really, really high.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

He's improbably won more tournaments, but none that seemed this improbable. And he's collected bigger pieces of metal, but the medal may be the one he loves the most.\n\nOnce the gold was finally around his neck Sunday, after 2 hours and 50 minutes of grueling tennis against the current best player on the planet, Novak Djokovic kept kissing it. Once, twice, a third time. Then he let it hang over his chest for a few seconds before picking it up again and smiling.\n\nAt age 37, in the midst of a season where he has been in a race against the clock of his tennis mortality, it's possible that even the most accomplished player in history started to lose a little belief that his Olympic dream would come true. That he could win something not just for his trophy case, but for all of Serbia. That he could complete the last piece of the puzzle before the compounding realities of age and injury made this career-long chase impossible.\n\n\"Bringing the gold medal to Serbia, this may be the greatest sports achievement in my life,\" Djokovic said on Serbian television moments after a 7-6, 7-6 victory over Carlos Alcaraz that will go down as one of the most impressive of his career.\n\nBecause this is no longer the Djokovic who has won 24 Grand Slam titles, who could glide around the court for five hours and contort his joints in ways that didn't seem humanly possible and then do it again 48 hours later. This is a player who began the year with flagging motivation and poor fitness, a player who rushed back from surgery after tearing his meniscus at the French Open and a player who looked a little helpless just a few weeks ago against the very same opponent in a Wimbledon final. This is a player who hadn't even won a tournament this year.\n\nAnd it also, for all intents and purposes, is Alcaraz's sport now. He's already won four Grand Slams, including the rare French Open-Wimbledon double. He's only 21 and already almost complete, whizzing around the court with speed and creativity and competitive fire that evokes the best traits of Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer all in one.\n\nWatching him now is a little bit like what it felt like a quarter-century ago when Tiger Woods would play majors: The numbers aren't there yet, and the historical conversations are years away, but you know you're seeing somebody do things you've never quite seen before.\n\nWhen you have those kind of rare athletes in your sport, their path is marked by pivot points. We saw the first a year ago at Wimbledon, when Alcaraz did what many thought was impossible by beating Djokovic in five seats. We saw another on the same court a few weeks ago, when Alcaraz was so thoroughly dominant that it seemed a legitimate question whether Djokovic could beat him again.\n\nAnd here in Paris, when he wasn't taking selfies at the athletes' village and soaking in the pageantry of his first Olympics, Alcaraz was crushing everyone in his wake.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be the highest mountain to climb,\" Djokovic said.\n\nDjokovic's prospects of beating Alcaraz in a final never looked particularly promising. Though he had easily handled a clearly diminished Nadal in the second round, perhaps delivering the final loss at Roland Garros to his 15-year rival, the knee was becoming a problem again. In the quarterfinals, Djokovic's mobility seemed so limited at one point that it was questionable whether he could even finish the match against Stefanos Tsitsipas. Down two breaks in the second set, Djokovic somehow managed to claw back and escape without even having to play a third.\n\nAnd so he arrived in the final guaranteed the silver - his best ever finish at the Summer Games, and there was some relief in that. But in a sport where the Grand Slams are clearly the pinnacle and there's no real consensus on how much an Olympic gold really means, Djokovic went completely the other direction.\n\nAfter four brutal Olympics - a third-set disappointment to Nadal in Beijing, a razor-thin loss to Andy Murray in London, a first-round upset to Juan Martin del Potro in Rio and an inexplicably flat performance in Tokyo against Alexander Zverev - this was Djokovic's last chance.\n\nHe knew it. He said it. He embraced it. He built his entire year around it, and suddenly it was right in front of him.\n\n\"I didn't need too much motivation,\" he said. \"I knew in the opening two rounds, the way I was playing, that this is my chance. If it's ever going to be, it's going to be now.\"\n\nAnd as only the all-time greats can do, he made it happen.\n\n\"I heard many, many times that Novak wanted to win the gold medal,\" Alcaraz said. \"Every Olympic Games he had played, at the end he said it. And I knew that before the match. I had a hungry Novak in front of me.\"\n\nIt is hard, at this point in Djokovic's career after so many big matches and Grand Slam finals, to still be wowed at the amount of willpower, concentration and competitive endurance he is capable of summoning. And yet, perhaps because of the player he had in front of him, Djokovic managed to play one of the most impressive matches of his career.\n\nAt times, his movement labored. After a few of their more demanding rallies, he hunched over and gasped for oxygen. When he decided to chase something down, the pain and fatigue was written all over his face. And when he had a chance to end a point, he went for it - particularly in the tiebreaks when Djokovic played bolder tennis and Alcaraz was more content to counterpunch well behind the baseline.\n\nThose little moments, those micro decisions, were all that separated them. Djokovic said he had never played a three-hour match packed with so much intensity, where the margins were so thin at every turn. But whereas Djokovic felt unburdened to go for dramatic angles and pick his moments to play high-risk tennis, Alcaraz felt something that was foreign to him in the four Grand Slam finals he has won in the last 24 months.\n\n\"In the difficult moments, in the tough situations, I increased my level and pulled out really great tennis,\" he said. \"Today, probably, I felt more pressure. I don't know. Maybe other players aren't feeling the same way about playing for the flag, but I felt the pressure in those situations that I couldn't play my best tennis.\"\n\nPerhaps there has never been more of a validating moment for Olympic tennis itself. No, it's not a Grand Slam. There will always be top players who skip it for one reason or another, be it surface changes, inconvenient travel between Wimbledon and the US Open or the lack of prize money and ranking points that go to the winner.\n\nBut here you had the best ever who put together Djokovic's masterpiece, with a prize he desperately wanted on the line, on the only day remaining in his career that he could possibly do it. And on the other side of the court, you had the current best player in the game, unable to meet the moment in a way that had become routine on the biggest stages in the sport.\n\nThen, a moment after the match ended on an inside-in forehand Djokovic slapped through the court, he dropped his racket and covered his mouth in disbelief. He went across the net to embrace Alcaraz and dropped to his knees, looking at the ground for nearly a minute. And then, he charged into the stands to embrace his family in a more emotional moment than we have seen from Djokovic in years as the winning of Grand Slams became almost routine.\n\n\"The intensity of emotions I felt at that moment was something I never felt on the tennis court before,\" Djokovic said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Spanish television cameras swarmed him, Alcaraz sobbed in a way he's never shown publicly after losses - not that there have been too many of them. But to this point in Alcaraz's career, every setback has been a lesson, even a blessing to help him maintain humility and sharpen his focus on his inevitable path to the top.\n\nAlcaraz, like Djokovic, is eventually going to win every big prize this sport has to offer. But the realization that he has to wait four more years for this one hit differently for a young man in a big hurry.\n\n\"I thought that I let all the Spanish people down a little bit in some way,\" Alcaraz said. \"I know that the Spanish people were waiting for my gold medal and myself, I worked for it, I went for it and it could have happened. That's why I got emotional at the end. I couldn't make the Spanish people proud. But right now, thinking, more relaxed, I think I made them proud and made them believe in a certain way, and I'm proud about the way I represented my flag.\"\n\nEven for superstars who have all the money, all the trophies, all the adulation they'll ever want around the world, there's something unique about that little piece of gold. Alcaraz will have more years to chase it. Djokovic just had one shot. And as the Serbian flag went up over Roland Garros, it meant everything.\n\n\"It supersedes everything that I've ever felt on the tennis court after winning big trophies,\" Djokovic said. \"When I

Just three weeks after the Spaniard defended his Wimbledon title by beating his Serb in straight sets, they'll face off in the men's tennis singles gold medal match at the Paris Olympics 2024. Neither have lost a set and are hunting for their first gold. The difference is that Alcaraz is 21 and Djokovic is 37.\n\nPlaying in his fifth Olympics as the 24-time Grand Slam champion, winning the gold is the only accomplishment left for the Serb, and he'll give him all to tick the final box off. That dream won't come true that easily. Alcaraz is in red-hot form. He won the French Open almost two months ago at the very same venue where he'll face Djokovic today.\n\nThey have a 3-3 head-to-head with a 1-1 record on clay. But Djokovic would be confident. He's beaten the Spaniard for two years ago in their only meeting at Roland Garros. As the favourite, the pressure to win will be on Alcaraz, and the Serb can take advantage of that.

He's improbably won more tournaments, but none that seemed this improbable. And he's collected bigger pieces of metal, but the medal may be the one he loves the most.\n\nOnce the gold was finally around his neck Sunday, after 2 hours and 50 minutes of grueling tennis against the current best player on the planet, Novak Djokovic kept kissing it. Once, twice, a third time. Then he let it hang over his chest for a few seconds before picking it up again and smiling.\n\nAt age 37, in the midst of a season where he has been in a race against the clock of his tennis mortality, it's possible that even the most accomplished player in history started to lose a little belief that his Olympic dream would come true. That he could win something not just for his trophy case, but for all of Serbia. That he could complete the last piece of the puzzle before the compounding realities of age and injury made this career-long chase impossible.\n\n\"Bringing the gold medal to Serbia, this may be the greatest sports achievement in my life,\" Djokovic said on Serbian television moments after a 7-6, 7-6 victory over Carlos Alcaraz that will go down as one of the most impressive of his career.\n\nBecause this is no longer the Djokovic who has won 24 Grand Slam titles, who could glide around the court for five hours and contort his joints in ways that didn't seem humanly possible and then do it again 48 hours later. This is a player who began the year with flagging motivation and poor fitness, a player who rushed back from surgery after tearing his meniscus at the French Open and a player who looked a little helpless just a few weeks ago against the very same opponent in a Wimbledon final. This is a player who hadn't even won a tournament this year.\n\nAnd it also, for all intents and purposes, is Alcaraz's sport now. He's already won four Grand Slams, including the rare French Open-Wimbledon double. He's only 21 and already almost complete, whizzing around the court with speed and creativity and competitive fire that evokes the best traits of Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer all in one.\n\nWatching him now is a little bit like what it felt like a quarter-century ago when Tiger Woods would play majors: The numbers aren't there yet, and the historical conversations are years away, but you know you're seeing somebody do things you've never quite seen before.\n\nWhen you have those kind of rare athletes in your sport, their path is marked by pivot points.

He was literally shaking with emotions and then ran into the stands to join his family. He cried out loud to show his never-seen-before emotional side. He was crying loudly while celebrating with his family and support staff as the thousands cheered loudly.\n\nTermed as one of the biggest events of the 33rd Summer Games, both Djokovic and Alcaraz produced an absolute thriller. Both were unable to break each other's serves throughout the match as the Serbian claimed both set tiebreakers comfortably to claim his first Gold and second Olympic medal.\n\nWith 24 Grand Slam titles, a record 428 weeks as no.1 and now with an Olympic gold, Djokovic achieved everything there is in tennis. He also became the only fifth tennis player after Steffi Graf (1988), Andre Agassi (1999), Rafael Nadal (2010) and Serena Williams (2012) to complete a 'Career Golden Slam', a term given to players who have won all four Grand Slam titles and an Olympic gold.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlos Alcaraz, 21, was the youngest finalist in the men's singles in Olympics history. Many tipped the Spanish star favourite over Djokovic after his famous win in the Wimbledon 2024 final last month. Alcaraz kept Djokovic on his toes throughout the match but lost his focus during the set tiebreakers.\n\nAlcaraz, playing in his maiden Olympics, also burst into tears during his post-match speech.\n\n\"I gave everything,\" Alcaraz said. \"It's painful to lose the way I lost this match,\" he added. \"I had my chances to probably be up in the match. I couldn't take it. Novak was playing great. He deserves this. In the tough moments, he increased his level.\n\n\"He played unbelievable shots... an unbelievable game. I'm a bit disappointed but honestly, I'll leave the court with my head really really high. Fighting for Spain was everything to me.

The Spanish champion manages to express his best tennis on red clay of the French Open, He is much younger than Novak Djokovic and has beaten him in the final of the Wimbledon Championships not long ago.\n\nThe four-time Grand Slam champion never hid his coming to Paris to win a gold medal, which would allow him to enter even more into the history of this sport. Carlitos has already won the French Open and Wimbledon this year, as well as winning the Masters 1000 in Indian Wells for the second consecutive time.\n\nDjokovic - on the other hand - will try to finally realize his dream of winning the gold medal for his country. The former world number 1 is not at the top of his form, but he still reached the final without losing a set. The 24-time Grand Slam champion has admitted that Alcaraz is the best player in the world right now and will need his best tennis if he wants to have a chance on the iconic Philippe Chatrier. The 37-year-old from Belgrade is happy because he is already sure to win a medal, but a legend of his caliber will give the maximum to achieve yet another feat in his career.\n\nThe bookmakers are all agreed that Carlos Alcaraz is clearly favored over Novak Djokovic in the final of the Paris Olympics. Australian legend Paul McNamee analysed the keys to the final through his X profile: \"Djokovic vs. Alcaraz, a landmark Olympic final. On red clay, given the results and injuries of this year, and their age, Carlitos is the big favorite. However, the fact that it is in 3 sets instead of 5 and playing with more freedom as an outsider helps Novak. The question is whether that's enough. A twist-off final.\" Fans and experts are hoping to see a much more balanced final than the Wimbledon Championships, where Alcaraz literally crushed Djokovic.\n\nThe 21-year-old from Murcia is eagerly awaiting this challenge: \"It's going to be a really special moment for me, in my life, in my career, so I'm going to try and enjoy this moment, because it's going to be really difficult. It's going to be difficult, but it's going to be special. I will try to be focused on myself and try not to hear all this, all the fans, all the people that say 'I'm going to win'. I just want to give 100 per cent my best tennis and hopefully I reach my goal to get the gold.\"\n\nAlcaraz showed an impressive performance against Aliassime in the first semi-final of the Olympic tournament, but he will have to be careful not to underestimate a legend like Nole Djokovic.\n\n\"We both are going to be very happy with a day off with no match tomorrow. He played a lot of matches with doubles and singles. Me, at this age, I'm really grateful to have a day off and recover my body and get ready for Sunday\" - Djokovic said during the press conference.\n\n\"That's going to be the biggest challenge that I can have at the moment, playing him on this court. He won Roland-Garros a month ago on this court.\" Despite the stakes, Djokovic feels a sense of freedom, adding, \"I have nothing to lose as I've already secured a medal, so I'm going to go for it\" - he added.\n\nNovak Djokovic is not going through the best of his career and has not yet won a title this year, but the Olympics have always been his biggest goal. The Serbian will miss the Masters 1000 in Montreal next week and focus on the US Open (waiting to see if he plays in Cincinnati).\n\n\"I'm disappointed to announce my withdrawal from the National Bank Open in Montreal,\" Djokovic explained. \"I have a lot of great memories from Montreal, winning two titles there (and two others in Toronto). However, as I'm recovering from my injury in a very busy calendar this summer, I need to make hard choices. I really hope I can return to Canada and Montreal in the coming years to play in front of their amazing fans.\" The 24-time Grand Slam champion has not played in Canada since 2018. \"While we're disappointed that Novak will be unable to take part in this year's tournament, we understand his decision and wish him the best at the Olympics and the remainder of his season,\" National Bank Open

To win Olympic gold at 37, I finally did it. Most of all, it's my country. The pride of playing for Serbia.\"\n\nHe joins Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf as just the fifth player to complete the career Golden Slam of all four Grand Slam titles and Olympic singles gold.\n\nThe boxing finals are due to take place next week at Roland Garros but this was a true heavyweight contest between the oldest and youngest Olympic men's singles finalists since tennis returned to the Games in 1988.\n\nAnticipation fizzed around a packed Court Philippe-Chatrier, with Serena Williams among those watching from the stands as well as Djokovic's two children, who waved Serbian flags and home-made signs.\n\nDjokovic said after finally breaking his Olympic semi-final hoodoo that he felt like a different player to the one who lost rather tamely to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.\n\nThe Serbian's right knee no longer appears to be limiting him, bar a brief scare in the quarter-finals against Stefanos Tsitsipas, and it was he who had the first chances of the final.\n\nAlcaraz trailed 0-40 in the fourth game as Djokovic stuck like glue to the baseline and piled on the pressure but the Spaniard was up to the task.\n\nIt was an extraordinary level of tennis, the pair outdoing each other with outrageous shot-making, but it was Alcaraz's enormous power that began to take charge.\n\nHe created eight break points, three at 2-2 then five more at 4-4, but Djokovic, on the ropes but not panicking, somehow withstood the onslaught.\n\nAs the clock ticked past the hour mark, Alcaraz saved a first set point, but Djokovic was not to be denied in the tiebreak, winning the final four points.\n\nWhen his final lunging forehand volley landed in after 93 minutes of action, the 37-year-old stood for several seconds with his fist in the air, soaking in the cheers from his fans.\n\nAlcaraz had started to over-hit a little in a search of a way through Djokovic's defences, and his frustration grew in the second set as the finish line approached with nothing to split them.\n\nGoing into the tiebreak, Djokovic knew one final effort would deliver the longed-for prize and two fizzing forehand winners gave him an early advantage that Alcaraz could not claw back.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score":

The Serb battled past his rival Carlos Alcaraz with a vintage display to win 7-6(3) 7-6(2) and complete his career Golden Slam in spectacular fashion, not dropping a set in six matches at Roland Garros in the 2024 Paris Olympics. With the win, he became the oldest man to win to finish top of the podium at the Games since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988 and achieved it less than a month after being thrashed in straight sets at the Wimbledon final by Alcaraz.\n\nFormer Inia cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has always been an avid follower of the game of tennis, and following Djokovic's memorable and emotional win on Court Philippe Chatrier, he not only dropped a congratulatory post for the 37-year-old, but also made his piece of analysis on where Djokovic managed to outclass Alcaraz in the final and where the Spaniard could still improve on his game.\n\nHe tweeted: \"Well done, @DjokerNole, on winning the gold medal at #Paris2024.@carlosalcaraz put up a strong fight and obviously has a bright future ahead, but Djokovic had an ace up his sleeve whenever he was serving. That was the key to his success today, in my opinion. Alcaraz has what it takes, but to truly dominate for years on all surfaces, he'll need to step up his serve!\"\n\nThe gold medal at the Olympics was his only missing puzzle in his illustrious career. Having made his debut at the Games in 2008, when he won the bronze medal, Djokovic suffered a shocking round-one exit in the 2016 Rio Olympics and finished fourth in both London and Tokyo. However, in a season where Djokovic has struggled to win a single trophy, the Olympic gold in Paris helped him become the fifth player - after Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams -- to complete the 'Golden Slam' of winning all four majors and an Olympic gold medal in singles.\n\n\"Everything [about this is special], but most of all it is my country,\" said Djokovic. \"It's my pride to play for Serbia.

Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as -- no, make that more than -- every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier's red clay at the end and why his tears flowed.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,\" said Djokovic, who didn't drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. \"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.\"\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\n\"In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,\" said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. \"That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.\"\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him -- and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nUntil getting Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Djokovic said, \"I was ready.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Third Lulu's Car Wash opens in Aiken Traffic delays anticipated as resurfacing begins on Aiken's Whiskey Road One person dead following fatal hit-and-run in Barnwell County Aiken-trained Post Time runs third in Whitney Stakes ARTS AND HUMANITIES: A lost Carolina novel is found New facility for Children's Place almost complete SC's Tax Free Weekend begins today.

Guest column: Biden administration should protect S.C.s prescription drug access Aiken funeral home owner, former employee arraigned on federal bank fraud charges What could be achieved with a renewed Penny Sales Tax? Corey Murphy shares insights with community leaders\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic -- and the \"highest mountain to climb at the moment,\" in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThere was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense. The No. 1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No. 2 Alcaraz saved six. Pressure? Ha. What pressure?\n\n\"We both played at a very high level,\" Djokovic said. \"We really went toe-to-toe.\"\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, Alcaraz -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. As Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters chanted \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\").\n\nYet the place was as quiet as a theater between points; play was delayed briefly when a young child's crying pierced the air that was thick with anticipation.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tiebreaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points, then turned to face his guest box -- which included his tennis team and his wife and their two children -- with a fist held high.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.\n\nWas he worried that moment would never arrive?\n\n\"There are always doubts. Absolutely, I had doubts,\" Djokovic said. \"But the belief and the conviction that I can make it is stronger than my doubts. It always has been. I knew that it's going to happen. It was just a matter of when it's going to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He saved eight break points against the 21-year-old Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final just three weeks ago.\n\nThe second set was just as thrilling, with the crowd alternating between \"Novak! Novak!\" and \"Carlos! Carlos!\" chants as the two men traded points.\n\nAppropriately, it came down to a second tiebreak, with Djokovic powering a forehand out of Alcaraz's reach for the victory. At that point, he fell to his knees in celebration, before making his way into the stands to celebrate with his family.\n\nWith a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles, 98 career titles and a record 428 weeks atop the ATP rankings, Djokovic has soared to the mountaintop of men's tennis. The Olympics were the only real hole on his resum\u00e9. He won bronze in 2008 (Beijing) before missing the podium three straight times, finishing fourth in 2012 (London) and 2021 (Tokyo) and suffering a shocking first-round exit in 2016 (Rio).\n\nThis victory -- over the reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion, no less -- surely solidifies his case as the Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) over Roger Federer, who never won Olympic singles gold, and Rafael Nadal, who won in 2008. Nadal, who lost to Djokovic last week, can no longer hold his gold medal over him.\n\nWithin tennis circles, winning a gold medal doesn't hold the same weight as winning a Grand Slam due in part to the sport's 64-year absence from the Games (1924-1988) and the best-of-three sets format. But perhaps Djokovic's title will be looked at differently given he won at a Grand Slam venue against a four-time Grand Slam champion.\n\nThen again, maybe it won't: He didn't face a single Top-10 player en route to the gold medal match (No. 11 Stefanos Tsitsipas was his highest-ranked opponent), and the men's singles field -- while relatively strong -- didn't feature world No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who withdrew with tonsillitis.\n\nAlcaraz, the youngest man to ever play in a men's singles final, now adds Olympic silver to his four major titles -- all before his 22nd birthday. While he failed to win in Paris, it was a tournament he'll never forget: playing Djokovic in the final and playing alongside Nadal in what were perhaps his idol's final matches at Roland-Garros.\n\nWith Sunday's victory, Djokovic improved to 4-3 against the young Spaniard, who is surely the future face of the sport and would likely be the present face if not for the legendary Serb who refuses to go away.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Tsitsipas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefanos Tsitsipas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nal9zo5FaH9rMdN4MPmYXw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTM-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/379ca7a94c98e6139ebc939b8ce605a5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Alcaraz, 21, is the youngest player in history to reach the Olympics final and is attempting to add the gold medal to French Open and Wimbledon titles this season.\n\nThe final at Roland Garros is an immediate rematch of last month's Wimbledon final, where Alcaraz denied Djokovic a record-equalling eighth title in SW19 and record 25th grand slam. The Spaniard won in straight-sets in one of the heaviest defeats of Djokovic's career, and was the second year in a row in which he had beaten the Serbian in the Wimbledon final.\n\nAlcaraz is competing at his first Olympics while Djokovic is at his fifth. The gold medal is the only honour that is missing from his record-breaking career and this could be Djokovic's last chance to do so. He will be 41 by the time of the next Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nFollow live score updates from the Olmypic final at Roland Garros, below\n\n15:47 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nAnd that's a mighty good time to collect a hold to love. Carlos Alcaraz conserves energy with rock solid tennis.\n\n15:45 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nNeither player will submit. Two and a half hours in, we remain without a break in this gold medal match.\n\n15:41 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nNovak Djokovic takes his time between games, adjusting the strapping on his right knee, which hasn't seemed to hamper him much at all. The level in this match has been simply extraordinary.\n\n15:38 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nBut Alcaraz won't let his opponent get away! Two beautifully-played points keep him very much alive.\n\n15:36 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nThis is simply sublime tennis. Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic go blow-for-blow in a rally that takes in all four corners of this massive Philippe-Chatrier surface, the youngster just about holding his nerve at the net.\n\nIt seems to set him on course for a love hold, but Djokovic is far from buried, upping the intensity and fighting back to deuce. If he could pinch this...\n\n15:31 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nCarlos Alcaraz howls like a wounded wolf, his prey having escaped him as a sight of a break point goes a-begging. Novak Djokovic has figured out a few gremlins in the Spaniard's system, repeatedly wrong-footing him with seemingly conservative strokes that are nonetheless bringing joy. 20 games in the match, 20 holds.\n\n15:23 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nWow. A golden opportunity for Novak Djokovic to get to 0-30, a point of superb construct seemingly setting up a volleyed winner. Alcaraz's shot is firm and intelligently fired at the body, though it's still a real surprise as Djokovic slices wide.\n\nThree more points to the Spaniard and back to the chair he goes relatively content.\n\n15:20 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nExtraordinary. Novak Djokovic's drop shot would have left just about every other player wandering across to field his next serve, so shallow and seemingly certain to hit the clay twice. But Alcaraz just moves differently, somehow closing the space in time not just to forge a winner but also a feint, ensuring that Djokovic is moving the wrong way as he lifts it up the line.\n\nThe Serb's serve just looks impenetrable at the moment, though. He's at 90% for the set and tonks his first ace of the match down the middle en route to squaring affairs.\n\n15:15 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nCarlos Alcaraz conjures something to extricate himself from 15-30, supreme movement as he hurries to his right before contorting his racquet around it for a cross-court hook winner. He's being forced to find something special with concerning regularity, but we remain without a break in the match.\n\n15:08 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nAs if to demoralise his younger opponent, Djokovic puts away his hold without fuss or fury. It feels like the pattern of play has swung dramatically from set one to two - Alcaraz needs to find something.\n\n15:04 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nA first doube fault from Alcaraz, the mental frazzles perhaps starting to show. A wretched inside-out forehand continues a slide from 30-0 to a Djokovic break point...but Alcaraz atones instantly, consulting the textbook between points to execute the same shot to perfection.\n\nAlcaraz gees himself up having restored order to get through another game.\n\n14:59 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nA change of approach on return from Carlos Alcaraz, having spent the first set way back beyond the baseline and now much more proactive with his position. Djokovic adapts as well as you would expect and wrong-foots an advancing Alcaraz to seal a hold to love.\n\n14:56 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nWe've seen that Carlos Alcaraz has serious stamina throughout this brilliant summer, but this is another test of his ability to sustain and survive. And Djokovic just seems to have found his range. A couple of flat forehands kiss the clay pleasantly to draw a couple of deuces.\n\nAlcaraz eventually holds, as you feel he must in the first phase of this second set.\n\n14:49 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nThe stands sway to a spot of Joe Dassin as Novak Djokovic nips away to do whatever he does between sets. Carlos Alcaraz shelters in the shade, mopping up the sweat on his forehead. Eight break points came and went for the Spaniard without joy in that set.\n\n14:46 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nVintage Novak Djokovic! Carlos Alcaraz made so much of the running but Djokovic has refused to yield, and a delectable forehand drop volley seals the opening set. 7-6 (7-3), in a little more than an hour-and-a-half. Gripping, gruelling, glorious.\n\n14:44 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nHow has that landed in? An extraordinary return winner from Novak Djokovic, somehow getting on top of a ball rising to chin height and catching the chalk inside the service box. Carlos Alcaraz can merely shrug.\n\nAll on serve at the change of ends, as you suspected it might be.\n\n14:39 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nToo good from Carlos Alcaraz. Novak Djokovic twice has second serves to attack early in the tie-break but can't get himself ahead in the point. Alcaraz blasts two more winners past him.\n\n14:35 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nThis is glorious tennis. We are now beyond the 80-minute mark in this marathon opening set and yet the quality and energy remains so, so high, Carlos Alcaraz sliding like Tom Cruise in Risky Business to bop a backhand winner down the line before showing off those deft hands to leave Novak Djokovic stranded.\n\nBut Djokovic has a break point! A couple of curious moments from Alcaraz, first yorking himself and flicking a backhand wide and then patting a volley into the mesh. Thankfully, that fabulous forehand is still in good working order. Deuce.\n\nA grunt and a groan from Djokovic as he over-reaches on the backhand side. Tie-break time!\n\n14:28 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nThe cry of a tot in amongst the ticket-holders causes a pause as Novak Djokovic steps away from a serve, thankfully seeing the funny side as the parent attends to the young heckler. Djokovic duly collects the point, though lets the next slip uncharacteristically tamely.\n\n\"Vamos!\" cries Alcaraz as Djokovic turns away in disgust having found the top of the net after another extended exchange. Djokovic is having to find the full extent of his strokemaking to keep pace with Alcaraz, who just looks to have extra gears right now. His 17th winner of the match takes us to bonus tennis.\n\n14:17 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nIt's Alcaraz's turn to salvage something, managing to get back to deuce. What a blow it would be for Djokovic to strike if he can hold...and he does at the second attempt. Gutsy, gutsy stuff, and he forces Alcaraz to serve to stay in the set.\n\n14:09 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nNow then. Novak Djokovic puts too much oomph into a forehand before carelessly double-faulting, his big kicker serve also too meaty. 0-30...though a confident clap to the corner gets the server's tally started after a floaty Alcaraz return.\n\nSome remarkable defensive tennis from Alcaraz earns him a break point, though, the Spaniard thrown this way and that in Djokovic's spin cycle but clinging on and drawing an error. But the Serbian just about survives, yet more superb Spanish scrambling not quite enough to force another mistake.\n\nBut there's been an uplift in the level in this game from Alcaraz, using his athleticism to snare another break point. Djokovic saves it once more. On we go.\n\nA third break point comes and goes, Alcaraz unable to land his big left hook. And a fourth! Djokovic is grittily clinging on. Break point five saved! Extraordinary. We're already beyond the hour-mark.\n\n14:01 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nMore like it from Alcaraz, nimbly back-pedalling along the baseline and unfurling a top spin forehand that is too deep and too good for Djokovic to get to.\n\nDjokovic thumps back a return that is, oddly, volleyed at knee height by Alcaraz deep in the court, but the Spaniard gets away with it as his opponent nets a drop shot. A hold to love.\n\n13:57 , Harry Latham-Coyle\n\nA few murmurs around Court Philippe-Chatrier as Carlos Alcaraz pushes an innocuous forehand long, and then it's the Spaniard himself ranting, furious having framed another simple enough return. A double fault - the first of the match - is the lone hiccup in a much more comfortable hold for Novak Djokovic.\n\n13:53 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAt this point of the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz was already a set up and racing into a lead in the second.\n\nAfter 40 minutes here we've had five games, with a series of long, tough holds that have gone to deuce.\n\nThe level is fantastic though, as Alcaraz rips a crosscourt winner past the advancing Djokovic in this sixth game.\n\nDjokovic saves another break point on his way to closing out the game and move 3-2 in front, meeting a smash after sending Alcaraz out wide on the serve.\n\nAlcaraz is really ramping up the forehand power and it led to two break points there, but he overcooked his biggest weapon.\n\n13:46 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nSublime, astonishing shot from Alcaraz as he races to meet a Djokovic drop shot and flick it down the line on his backhand side.\n\n30-30. Winner from Alcaraz! That was all down to sheer power! He forced Djokovic back behind the backhand and then crushes the forehand winner!\n\n30-40 and break point: but that's a brilliant serve from Djokovic, right down the middle.\n\nWonderful from Alcaraz! He saves three break points from 0-40 down. Alcaraz gets his hold as he sends Djokovic running out wide to right, then stepping in to land the soft drop-volley.\n\n13:38 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nNow it's Djokovic's turn to get a look at 0-30! Alcaraz goes for the backhand sliced dropshot but Djokovic reads it and flicks the winner up the line.\n\nOn the Alcaraz serve, Djokovic attacks - a roaring forehand winner up the line, right off the bat against Alcaraz's serve! What a shot!\n\nThree break points: Alcaraz saves the first with a forehand behind Alcaraz. Now the second as Alcaraz moves in to snap a backhand crosscourt.\n\nThird break point: and Djokovic puts the return out on the backhand! I think Djokovic thought that serve was out. But it's deuce.\n\n13:31 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nWoah! Sensational defence from Alcaraz, scurrying from side to side to keep the point alive. He hangs up a lob and Djokovic puts it long!\n\nThat brings up 0-30. Alcaraz overcooks two forehands in a row, and then finds the net on the backhand as Djokovic sends him running.\n\nAlcaraz gets his hold after the second deuce and pumps his fist as Djokovic floats a slice long. Alcaraz stepped up his forehand power.\n\nDjokovic rips a scorching winner off Alcaraz's forehand, sending it crosscourt for an euption from his fans.\n\nSuddenly, it's break point as Alcaraz puts two consecutive backhands into the net from 40-30. An early chance for Djokovic.\n\nAlcaraz is close to the ace out wide, but it's out. Djokovic finds a sharp return... Alcaraz goes for the drop shot, and it lands!\n\nRemember the opening game of the Wimbledon final? It was an epic. This was not so much. Djokovic jumps out to 40-0 as Alcaraz makes a couple of errors.\n\nDjokovic also looked to shorten points as much as possible in the Wimbledon final. He brings Alcaraz in, but the Spaniard is too quick and finds the angled volley.\n\nThen Djokovic goes long. Back to 40-30. Big serve from Djokovic! He gets his hold to start the final.\n\n13:07 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nSteffi Graf, Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal and Andre Agassi.\n\nOnly four players in tennis singles history have completed the career golden slam: winning the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, and Olympic gold.\n\nNovak Djokovic can become the fifth.\n\nSerena Williams is actually in the front row today.\n\n13:02 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nHere we go! Djokovic and Alcaraz are in the tunnel and will step out onto the court in the next few moments.\n\nAlcaraz is jumping up and down like a coiled spring ready to go. He leads Djokovic up the stairs and out into the sunshine on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nA huge ovation greets both players as they are welcomed onto court. There are lots of Spanish fans here, flags everywhere.\n\nBut Djokovic has fans whereever he goes and there are plenty of Serbian flags in the stands as well. It's electric!\n\n12:51 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nNovak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz have only played two times on clay. One was their first ever meeting in Madrid when Alcaraz won a sensational title at the age of just 18. The other was a year later at the French Open semi-finals.\n\nIt didn't to to play for Alcaraz, who was hit by cramps after the second set. Alcaraz later admitted it was because of the nerves of facing Djokovic at a grand slam. It proved a critical moment in his career.\n\nA month later, he was beating Djokovic to win the Wimbledon title. A year later, he was winning both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same summer - beating Djokovic again on the grass.\n\nAhead of their return to Court Philippe-Chatrier, Djokovic faces a very different Alcaraz.\n\n12:37 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nIt's a gorgeous day in Paris for this men's singles final, and one of the best Olympic finals in years, between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nThere will be a break as the doubles net is replaced with the singles net and Court Philippe-Chatrier is prepared. Djokovic and Alcaraz will take to the court at 1pm BST.\n\n12:32 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nNovak Djokovic was brutally honest about his performance after he was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz in last month's Wimbledon final:\n\n\"I was inferior on the court. That's it. He was a better player. He played every single shot better than I did,\" he said.\n\n\"I did all I can to prepare myself for this match and this tournament in general. If someone told me I would play Wimbledon finals three, four weeks ago, I would take it for sure.\n\n\"Of course, I do feel disappointed. It's a bitter taste to lose the finals the way I did today. I can always be self-critical, which I am. I can always find the flaws, which I can already see.\n\n\"I don't think that would change too much the course of the match, to be honest. From the very beginning, you could see he was at least half a step better than I am in every way.\n\n\"I also feel like, in a match-up today against the best player right now in the world for sure, other than Jannik [Sinner}, and both of them are the best this year by far, I'm not at that level.\"\n\n12:24 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nIt's bronze in the women's doubles for Spain as Sara Sorribes Tormo and Cristina Bucsa defeat Czech pair Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova 6-2 6-2.\n\nA fine victory for the Spaniards, who were controlled and aggressive. The Czechs made too many errors to compete.\n\nIt kicks off the Spanish party on Court Philippe-Chatroer, which is already full of Spanish flags everywhere you look.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz will look to continue it when he takes on Novak Djokovic in the men's final, which is next.\n\n12:05 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nTwenty-one days ago, Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final with a brilliant display on Centre Court.\n\nAlcaraz became just the third man aged 21 and under to win multiple Wimbledon titles, after Bjorn Borg and Borris Becker. The Spaniard is also just the sixth man in the Open era to win Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same summer, joining Borg, Rod Laver, Roger Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.\n\nIt's clear Alcaraz is on his way to becoming an all-time great. Now, he goes for further history in the Olympics final and Djokovic is his opponent once again.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz delivers destruction of Novak Djokovic to win second Wimbledon title\n\n\"Alcaraz has proved the best player in the world at the moment.\n\n\"He's definitely favourite, but it's the Olympics, it's anybody's game.\"\n\n11:45 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nFirst set! Cristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo get the Spain fans on their feet in Court Philippe-Chatrier as they take the opening set 6-2 against Karoline Muchova and Linda Noskova.\n\nGreat first set from them, with plenty of passing winners. There are Spain flags everywhere you look and it's building into a great atmosphere before Djokovic vs Alcaraz.\n\nBefore we are treated to Novak Djokovic vs Carlos Alcaraz in the men's final, we have the bronze medal match in the women's doubles.\n\nGoing for bronze, we have the Czech duo of Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova against Spain pair Cristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo.\n\nThe Czechs already have one gold from the tennis competition after Katerina Siniakova and Tomas Machas triumphed in the mixed doubles.\n\nSpain could get their first medal on the board before Alcaraz faces Djokovic for gold in the men's singles final laster this afternoon.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This victory allowed Djokovic to complete the career 'Golden Slam,' a feat achieved by only four other players: Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf.\n\nThe Serbian legend, already a record-holder with 24 major titles, won the final in straight sets: 7-6(3), 7-6(2).\n\nA historic milestone for Novak Djokovic\n\nDjokovic's gold medal win cements his place in tennis history, marking him as one of the few to win all four Grand Slam titles and the Olympic gold. His Olympic journey began with a bronze medal in singles at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Subsequent attempts saw him finish fourth in London 2012, endure an early exit in Rio 2016, and fall short in the bronze-medal match at Tokyo 2020.\n\nThe final showdown against Carlos Alcaraz\n\nFacing French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz, Djokovic delivered his best performance of the year. The match was tightly contested, with Djokovic demonstrating exceptional composure and resilience, particularly in the first set where he faced eight breakpoints.\n\nHis clinical performance in both tie-breaks underscored his experience and mental fortitude, proving decisive in the match. This victory comes after Djokovic's recent loss to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final, where he was defeated in five sets: 6-1, 6-7, 1-6, 6-3, 4-6. However, in Paris, Djokovic outclassed Alcaraz, capitalizing on key moments and showcasing his strategic acumen.\n\nAlso READ: Sachin Tendulkar discloses his ideal Tennis batting partner and top cricketers for doubles\n\nSachin Tendulkar's insight\n\nFormer Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, an avid tennis follower, congratulated Djokovic and offered his analysis on the match and reason behind Novak's edge over Alcaraz in the summit-clash.\n\n\"Well done, @DjokerNole on winning the gold medal at #Paris2024 @carlosalcaraz put up a strong fight and obviously has a bright future ahead, but Djokovic had an ace up his sleeve whenever he was serving. That was the key to his success today, in my opinion.

Even without the gold medal, Djokovic was still widely considered to be one of the greatest tennis players ever.\n\nHe didn't settle, however. He already had a career grand slam, but the gold medal would give him the rare golden grand slam. Djokovic delivered at the 2024 Paris Olympics, earning the men's singles gold medal for Serbia.\n\nDjokovic defeated 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz to become the oldest men's singles player to win gold since 1908.

The Serbian won a bronze medal at the Beijing Summer Games but has missed out on the hardware in each of the previous three Olympic Games.\n\n\"I put my heart, my soul, my body, my family -- my everything -- on the line to win Olympic gold,\" Djokovic said. \"Incredible battle. Incredible fight.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old secured a medal in Paris, but he had a familiar face on the other side of the clay. Alcaraz, a 21-year-old Spanish tennis player, has taken over the sport with four grand slam titles in his short career.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic have faced off six times prior to the Paris Olympics, with both sides earning three wins apiece. Two of Alcaraz's wins came in back-to-back Wimbledon Finals.\n\nBEST U.S. OLYMPIANS\n\nTop 33 rankings | Simone Biles | Katie Ledecky | Jesse Owens\n\nDjokovic broke the tie and now owns a 4-3 advantage over the youngster. He becomes the oldest men's singles player to win gold at the Olympics since 1908 while simultaneously preventing Alcaraz from becoming the youngest to win gold.\n\nHe did this all while battling an injury at the 2024 Olympics. Djokovic believed he may have re-injured his right knee just a couple of months after tearing his meniscus.\n\nDjokovic left the French Open due to the meniscus tear, opting for surgery ahead of the Olympics. He felt a \"sharp pain\" in his right knee during the quarterfinals in Paris.\n\n\"I'm concerned about the state of the knee,\" Djokovic said after the quarterfinal. \"I cannot give you exact information because I don't have it.\"\n\nHe ultimately played in the semifinal the next day and secured at least a silver medal with his win over Italy's Lorenzo Musetti.

The injury sidetracked me a little bit. But coming into the Olympic Games I felt like a different player in terms of how I moved, how I played.\n\n'In a way losing heavily to Alcaraz at Wimbledon probably worked in my favour as I knew I couldn't play any worse than that.'", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken English Daily in Bangladesh"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://outspoken.newagebd.com/files/img/202408/980e60ce29b550dc097492cb56af0702_og_og.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6235294117647059, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

His clinical performance in both tie-breaks highlighted his experience and mental fortitude, proving decisive in the tightly contested match.\n\nDjokovic has recently lost to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final, going down 6-1, 6-7, 1-6, 6-3, 4-6 in five sets.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_india@thehansindia.com", "name": "Hans India", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/08/04/1468121-djokovic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Djokovic is now an Olympic champion and forever will be. And in another sense, the years of waiting, the stumbles along the journey, made him appreciate this triumph as much as -- no, make that more than -- every other, which is why his hands trembled when he knelt on Court Philippe Chatrier's red clay at the end and why his tears flowed.\n\n\"When I take everything into consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I ever had in my career,\" said Djokovic, who didn't drop a set in Paris and is the oldest man to win the Summer Games tennis title since 1908. \"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience, that I could feel.\"\n\nWith margins so thin that any mistake felt as if it could tilt things, Djokovic was at his best when the stakes were highest, dominating each of the two tiebreakers against Alcaraz, who beat him in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago.\n\n\"In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreaks, he played an impressive game,\" said silver medalist Alcaraz, the 21-year-old from Spain who sobbed, too, after falling short of becoming the youngest male singles gold medalist. \"That's why I saw that he's hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.\"\n\nDjokovic already owns a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. He also already owned an Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient. He kept talking over the past week, but also the past months, about what a priority the gold was for him -- and Alcaraz said Sunday he kept hearing about it.\n\nUntil getting Paris bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy on Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in Olympic semifinals, losing to the gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Djokovic said, \"I was ready.\"\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets.\n\nThe 2-hour, 50-minute final featured one of the best to ever do it, in Djokovic -- and the \"highest mountain to climb at the moment,\" in Alcaraz, as Djokovic put it.\n\nThere was superb ball-striking, deft drop shots and tremendous sprinting, sliding, stretching defense. The No. 1 seed Djokovic saved eight break points, No. 2 Alcaraz saved six. Pressure? Ha. What pressure?\n\n\"We both played at a very high level,\" Djokovic said. \"We really went toe-to-toe.\"\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, Alcaraz -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Those in the stands became part of the show, breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. As Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters chanted \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\").\n\nYet the place was as quiet as a theater between points; play was delayed briefly when a young child's crying pierced the air that was thick with anticipation.\n\nThe first set alone lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, full of epic shots and epic games. One lasted 18 points spread over more than a dozen mesmerizing minutes on the way to that tiebreaker, when Djokovic grabbed the last four points, then turned to face his guest box -- which included his tennis team and his wife and their two children -- with a fist held high.\n\nIn the second tiebreaker, after Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point for a 3-2 lead, he waved his arms to encourage the folks standing and screaming. Soon, thanks to one last forehand winner, he had earned that prize he wanted, at long last.\n\nWhen the Serbian national anthem finished ringing out, Djokovic reached for his gold and brought it to his lips for a kiss.\n\nWas he worried that moment would never arrive?\n\n\"There are always doubts. Absolutely, I had doubts,\" Djokovic said. \"But the belief and the conviction that I can make it is stronger than my doubts. It always has been. I knew that it's going to happen. It was just a matter of when it's going to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/zHYeJsagcagO-GF4a5zDxXBr_js=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/IYJPOFKCYKRJGJIVPZZLOFB6AI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The success in the French capital also helped him become only the fifth tennis player in history after Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, and Serena Williams to win all four Grand Slam titles and a gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nAfter Djokovic's win in the final, Surya took to Instagram to post a picture of the legendary tennis player and captioned it, \"This man is on fire! Well fought and so well deserved @djokernole.\"\n\nHe also appreciated silver medallist Alcaraz's efforts by stating, \"What a fight by @carlitosalcarazz.\"\n\n'Let Spain down'\n\nAlcaraz, who was looking to become the youngest tennis player to win an Olympic gold, was in tears after losing the men's singles final and said he felt he \"let Spain down.\"\n\n\"I feel that I let the Spanish people down. I feel they were waiting for the gold medal,\" said Alcaraz.\n\n\"I got emotional because I couldn't make the Spanish people proud. That's (why) I got emotional.\"\n\nA win over Djokovic would have continued Alcaraz's golden summer, in which he won his first French Open on the same Roland Garros courts that hosted the Olympics and then successfully defended his Wimbledon title by getting better of Serb in straight sets.\n\n\"I'm a bit sad, but I did a great tournament. It was a really great match, and I'm really proud of myself,\" he added.\n\n\"I was facing a hungry Novak; he was very impressive today. He didn't let me have many chances, so credit to him, and he deserves victory.\"\n\nDespite his disappointment, Alcaraz said he will learn from Sunday's loss as he heads to North America and an assault on the US Open, which he won in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harshit_bisht@news18.com", "name": "Harshit Bisht", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/08/suryakumar-yadav-novak-djokovic-2024-08-89ef82d116d42bdc96c9a970a15d4834-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 142, "textEnd": 150}], "sentiment": 0.6941176470588235, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Djokovic defeated the Spaniard 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-2) to clinch the only major title that had been missing from his stellar trophy cabinet.\n\nOn winning the men's singles gold medal contest, Djokovic shared a customary hand shake with Alcaraz. However, Djokovic could not hold his tears as he began crying with joy. The winner of 24 Grand Slams then carried the Serbian flag around the court.\n\nAnd just a few seconds later, Djokovic could be seen going into his player's box to join the celebrations with his family and his team.

His last medal came in the year 2008, when he played his first-ever Olympics in Beijing and won a bronze medal.\n\nAfter the win, Djokovic was quoted as saying:\n\n\"I don't know what to say. I'm still in shock. I put my heart, soul, body, family, everything on the line to win the Olympic Gold at the age of 37. The pride to play for Serbia. Carlos and Rafa love to play for Spain, Andy for Britain, Roger for Switzerland. You just see the reactions when they win. It's special. It's different.\n\nHe also lauded Alcaraz for putting up an equal fight and added:\n\n\"Incredible battle, fight. I honestly when the last shot went past him it was the only moment I thought I could win the match. He keeps on coming back and asking me to play my best tennis. It was fair to finish both sets in tiebreak.\"\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion's reaction to the victory said it all and how much this meant to him. The tennis legend broke into tears and also kneeled down on the ground. While kneeling his hands could be seen shivering, displaying the burst of emotions inside him to have finally added the only achievement left, to his trophy cabinet.\n\nBut it wasn't only Djokovic who went viral with his reaction. Alcaraz, too, after the match, had a lot to express and that won hearts even amongst many fans of the Serb as well. The 21-year-old was left heartbroken as he failed to win a gold medal for Spain in his debut Olympics tournament.\n\nHowever, he couldn't fulfill his dream as he lost to the 37-year-old, despite having defeated him at Wimbledon a month back. That made Alcaraz cry and was inconsolable for a few minutes until he gave an interview.\n\nFans believe that Alcaraz will get another opportunity to win gold in the Olympics someday as they sympathised with him for having an understandable reaction.\n\nBut Alcaraz was sporting enough to laud Djokovic and blamed his inability to not step up on big moments for his loss.\n\nAlcaraz is next expected to play in the Cincinnati Open before the US Open later in August. Djokovic, too, will be skipping the Canadian Open and is yet to announce his next tournament.\n\nBut the way the duo is playing, any of them could reclaim the World No.1 ranking from Jannik Sinner in the near future. And it could also mean that fans could get to see another Alcaraz-Djokovic clash in the 2024 season.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nandini_rikhee@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Nandini Rikhee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindner_Family_Tennis_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lindner Family Tennis Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/11/e2801b39-untitled-design-9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

At 37, he put forth his finest performance of the 2024 season, defeating the formidable Carlos Alcaraz 7-6(3), 7-6(2) to secure his first Olympic gold medal. Djokovic navigated through two tie-breaks, including a monumental 94-minute first set, to triumph over his esteemed adversary and claim the Olympic title, a mere eight and a half weeks post meniscus surgery on his right leg.\n\nHis triumph on Court Philippe-Chatrier saw Djokovic realize a long-sought dream by capturing the elusive, significant singles tennis accolade. The record-setting 24-time Grand Slam champion was overtly moved, shedding tears after a forehand winner against Alcaraz confirmed his place at the pinnacle of the podium.\n\nLast month, Djokovic succumbed to Alcaraz at Wimbledon's final, his sole competition following knee surgery. However, he has now joined the elite ranks of Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, and Serena Williams as the fifth player to achieve the 'Golden Slam' -- winning all four major titles and an Olympic gold in singles.\n\nBoth Djokovic and Alcaraz displayed extraordinary fortitude under duress, with a first set featuring 13 break points (Djokovic 5, Alcaraz 8) progressing to a tie-break sans a service break. Noteworthy moments included Alcaraz's comeback from 0/40 in the fourth game and Djokovic's resilience in a fluctuating ninth game, brimming with thrilling play from both, despite facing five break points.\n\nDjokovic's ultimate break point in the set also served as a set point at 6-5, 30/40. Unable to capitalize, the Serbian maintained his poise, securing four consecutive points from 3/3 in the tie-break to advance on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nContrary to the opening set, the second set offered few opportunities for returns for both players. However, this was not indicative of a decline in performance from two of the world's premier players. Djokovic continued to vary the pace to keep Alcaraz on the move, while the Spaniard, who saved the set's only break point in the third game, showcased his signature shot-making flair.\n\nDjokovic consistently managed to elicit errors from his formidable adversary and also delivered a series of top-tier winners. A sharp cross-court forehand winner at 2/2 in the second-set tie-break exemplified the Serbian's focus, and he confidently secured the next four points to win the match.\n\nAlcaraz sought to complement his remarkable summer with an Olympic title, having secured his third and fourth Grand Slam victories at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. At 21, the Spaniard was the youngest finalist in a singles gold-medal match since tennis's reintroduction to the Olympics in 1988, while Djokovic was the most senior.\n\nThe Sunday match marked the second meeting on Court Philippe-Chatrier for the PIF ATP Rankings' second-placed Djokovic and third-placed Alcaraz, following Djokovic's victory in the 2022 Roland Garros semi-finals. Djokovic now leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 4-3.", "source": {"uri": "pragativadi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yajati_keshari_rout@pragativadi.com", "name": "Yajati Keshari Rout", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://pragativadi.com/core/uploads/2024/08/Novak-Djokovic-Wins-2024-Olympic-Gold-Medal.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The Serbian champion won one of the few titles that were still missing in his immense palmar\u00e9s - the gold medal at the Olympics - beating Carlos Alcaraz in Paris and overturning the predictions of the eve. The 24-time Grand Slam champion pulled off his best performance of the season, shocking Alcaraz and winning two tiebreaks after almost three hours of battle. The final of the Paris Olympics was the most beautiful match of 2024, full of spectacle and incredible rallies.\n\nThanks to his victory at the Paris Olympics, the 37-year-old from Belgrade has fulfilled his greatest dream and completed the Career Golden Slam. Nole's numbers are truly impressive: 24 Grand Slam titles, 40 Masters 1000, 7 Nitto ATP Finals, 1 Davis Cup and an Olympic gold medal, besides becoming the oldest player to win gold medal since 1988.\n\nThe Serbian also became the first player in history to win an Olympic tournament without losing a set and the fifth player ever to complete the Career Golden Slam after Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Serena Williams. The final of the Olympic tournament between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz was one of the best matches in recent months.\n\nTennis legend Rennae Stubbs has paid tribute to these two outstanding champions through her X profile: \"If you're not watching the final between Djokovic and Alcaraz, what's wrong with you! Oh my God! It's one of the best matches I've seen this year (if not the best).\"\n\nAlcaraz played a great match and proved once again to be a great champion, but he missed something compared to Djokovic in the decisive moments. Speaking with former ATP ace Alex Corretja after the match, Carlitos burst into tears: \"It's complicated. We fought a match of almost three hours, we didn't take advantage of the opportunities we had, and playing against Djokovic is never easy. He always brings a very high level in those moments. He also deserves this opportunity. It hurts to lose the way I've lost, but I leave with my head held high knowing that I gave it my all.\"\n\nDjokovic - on the other hand - expressed his happiness for having achieved his dream: \"It's been an incredible battle, a great fight. When the last shot went through Carlos' side, it was the only time I thought I could win the game. I don't know what to say, I'm still in shock. I put my heart, soul, body, family, everything on the line to win Olympic gold at 37. I am proud to play for Serbia. Carlos and Rafa love playing with Spain, Andy with Great Britain and Roger with Switzerland. You just see the reactions when they win and it's special, different.\"\n\nNovak has learned from his previous experiences at the Olympics and made no mistakes in Paris. A few days ago - during a long interview with Clay - the Serbian captain Viktor Troicki explained the changes adopted by Djokovic: \"Tokyo was a huge experience for him, you know, 6-1, 2-1 with the break, against Zverev in the semifinals. Everything going well, everything. But he's also a human. Zverev started playing better.\n\nHe started feeling a little bit of pressure and at the end it cost him the match. He won so many big titles, but this was the first time he felt the goal was there, so close. I think here in Paris he's more relaxed, more focused on the things he needs to do. He also made a mistake playing mixed doubles. I think he also lost energy playing mixed doubles for no reason.\n\nIt was extremely h*t there and here he's only focused on the singles title and he's doing everything to accomplish it. Here he has family with him, kids are with him. So I think he feels better here mentally and that is the most important thing for him at this moment. Well that's one of the many mistakes he learned from. He's like this. He's stubborn sometimes. Even if everyone tells him you shouldn't play, if he thinks he should play, he will do it. And will try to prove everyone wrong. And he was close. He was close.\"\n\nAfter this feat at 37, it's really hard not to argue that Djokovic is the best player ever. The former world number 1 has conquered everything a player can win in the professional tour and the circle is closed with this amazing victory. Nole should return to the court in Cincinnati before the US Open.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simone_brugnoli@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Simone Brugnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennae_Stubbs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rennae Stubbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c0lex_Corretja", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c0lex Corretja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Troicki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Troicki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image152199.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He had also lost three semi-finals.\n\nNow he wants to keep playing and has not ruled out trying to win back-to-back golds at Los Angeles in four years' time.\n\n\"I want to play in Los Angeles, I enjoy playing for my country in the Olympic Games, in the Davis Cup,\" he added.\n\nDjokovic became just the fifth player to complete a career Golden Slam.\n\nVictory allowed him to join Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Steffi Graf and the watching Serena Williams as the only players to win all four Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic singles gold.\n\nHe also became the oldest singles champion since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988 and shattered Alcaraz's bid to add gold to the French Open and Wimbledon titles he has already pocketed this summer.\n\nAn emotional Djokovic celebrated by holding aloft the Serbian flag on court before clambering into the players' box to embrace his wife and children.\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" said Djokovic, who had lost heavily to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final last month.\n\n\"I put my body, my family on the line to win gold and finally I did it.\" Alcaraz was distraught and wept as he attempted to conduct a TV interview. \"Three hours, a big battle with tough moments,\" said the 21-year-old after a final in which neither player dropped serve. \"It's very painful to lose.\" Djokovic carved out a break point in the second game of the opener and three more in the fourth, all saved by the Spaniard.\n\nThen it was the Serb's turn to demonstrate his famed powers of resilience, fighting off three break points in the fifth game and another five in a marathon ninth game.\n\nIn a rollercoaster duel, Alcaraz saved a set point in the 12th game but his veteran opponent dominated the tiebreak to claim the opener after a breathless 93 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThere was no let-up in the second set, scintillating shot-making alongside rousing defence with Alcaraz fighting off the final's 14th break point in the third game.\n\nAgain the set was decided by a tie-break and it was Djokovic with history on the line again sweeping through to take victory after two hours and 50 minutes.\n\nLorenzo Musetti defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets on Saturday to claim the bronze medal, giving Italy its first men's tennis medal in 100 years.\n\nLater Sunday, Russian athletes can claim their first gold of the Games when Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider face the Italian team of Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini in the women's doubles.\n\nRussian competitors are taking part in the Olympics as neutrals following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022.\n\nIf Andreeva and Shnaider win gold, their achievement will not be recognised in the medals table while both the Russian flag and national anthem will be banned from the podium ceremony.\n\nCristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo, the Spanish eighth seeds, defeated the Czech pair of Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-2 in the bronze medal match.dj/jw", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [],

The Serbian champion defeated Carlos Alcaraz of Spain in straight sets, 7-6(3) 7-6(2). This victory adds to Djokovic's already impressive career, making him the oldest man to win a Summer Games tennis gold and the fifth player to complete a \"golden slam\".\n\nThe match took place on the clay courts of Roland-Garros, where Alcaraz had won the French Open title just two months earlier. Despite concerns about his surgically-repaired right knee after the quarterfinals, Djokovic showed no signs of weakness. He dominated Lorenzo Musetti in the semi-finals and played with confidence against the 21-year-old Alcaraz in the final.\n\nThis Olympic triumph marks a significant milestone in the ongoing rivalry between Djokovic and Alcaraz. It was their seventh meeting in competition, with Djokovic now leading the head-to-head series 4-3. The victory also serves as redemption for Djokovic following his loss to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final earlier this year.\n\nDjokovic's Olympic gold adds to his impressive tally of 24 Grand Slam titles. He joins an elite group of tennis players who have achieved the \"golden slam\", including Andre Agassi, Stefanie Graf, Rafael Nadal, and Serena Williams. This accomplishment cements Djokovic's status as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.\n\nThe match highlighted the contrast between Djokovic's experience and Alcaraz's youth. While Alcaraz has been making waves in the tennis world with his recent Grand Slam victories, Djokovic's extensive experience on clay and in high-pressure situations proved decisive in this Olympic final.", "source": {"uri": "thewillnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jude_obafemi@thewillnews.com", "name": "Jude Obafemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Novak-Djokovic-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 9}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

finally gets his hands on gold after beating Carlos Alcaraz", "body": "Novak Djokovic gained revenge on Carlos Alcaraz in a pulsating men's singles final to claim his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe Serbian first played in the Games back in 2008 but he arrived in Paris with only one bronze medal to show for his efforts and a burning desire to finally take his last chance to stand on the top step of the podium.\n\nHe lost in straight sets to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final only three weeks ago and had not won a title all season but, playing in the red of Serbia, the 37-year-old produced a superb performance to win 7-6 (3) 7-6 (2).\n\nWhen his final forehand found the corner, Djokovic dropped his racket and turned to his family in delight and disbelief before lying on the court, his ultimate goal finally realised.\n\nThe 37-year-old then climbed into the stands and cried uncontrollably as he embraced his family and supporters.\n\nHe joins Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf as just the fifth player to complete the career Golden Slam of all four grand slam titles and Olympic singles gold.\n\nThe boxing finals are due to take place next week at Roland Garros but this was a true heavyweight contest between the oldest and youngest Olympic men's singles finalists since tennis returned to the Games in 1988.\n\nAnticipation fizzed around a packed Court Philippe Chatrier, with Serena Williams among those watching from the stands as well as Djokovic's two children, who waved Serbian flags and home-made signs.\n\nDjokovic said after finally breaking his Olympic semi-final hoodoo that he felt like a different player to the one who lost rather tamely to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.\n\nThe Serbian's right knee no longer appears to be limiting him, bar a brief scare in the quarter-finals against Stefano Tsitsipas, and it was he who had the first chances of the final.\n\nAlcaraz trailed 0-40 in the fourth game as Djokovic stuck like glue to the baseline and piled on the pressure but the Spaniard was up to the task.\n\nIt was an extraordinary level of tennis, the pair outdoing each other with outrageous shot-making, but it was Alcaraz's enormous power that began to take charge.\n\nHe created eight break points, three at 2-2 then five more at 4-4, but Djokovic, on the ropes but not panicking, somehow withstood the onslaught.\n\nAs the clock ticked past the hour mark, Alcaraz saved a first set point, but Djokovic was not to be denied in the tie-break, winning the final four points.\n\nWhen his final lunging forehand volley landed in after 93 minutes of action, the 37-year-old stood for several seconds with his fist in the air, soaking in the cheers from his fans.\n\nAlcaraz had started to over-hit a little in a search of a way through Djokovic's defences, and his frustration grew in the second set as the finish line approached with nothing to split them.\n\nGoing into the tie-break, Djokovic knew one final effort would deliver the longed-for prize and two fizzing forehand winners gave him an early advantage that Alcaraz could not claw back.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType":

In the best match he has played this year, and in the first title he has won this year, Djokovic defeated Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, 7-6, 7-6 in a two-hour-and-52-minute classic.\n\nThe GOAT debate has long been settled with 24 majors. Djokovic has declared game-set-match on that competition, but now he has entered an entirely new pasture: Is this the greatest living athlete? With today's triumph, he has now won every major event at least three times. He has won every Masters 1000 title. He has now won Olympic gold. He's done it all by elevating his tennis when the stakes matter most -- the abiding theme of his unrivaled career.\n\nToday's match was in part about tennis. Three Sundays ago, these same two opponents met at Wimbledon and Alcaraz got the better of his opponent 15 years his senior. He moved better, he defended better, he served better. He won in straight sets. In 21 days, Djokovic completely flipped the script. On the clay of Roland Garros where he has won the title three times (though Alcaraz won the title earlier this summer), Djokovic served nearly flawlessly, unbroken in 24 service games. He rendered Alcaraz a non-combatant, using depth to keep the Spaniard at bay and neutralize his power. Djokovic also showed few effects of the knee injury that has jeopardized his summer.\n\nBut beyond the X's and O's, this was really constitutional. Djokovic has made no secret of his motivation to win gold. As he put it to me several months ago: \"It has been [a gap on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9] for a very long time. ... The Olympic Games are the oldest ever sports event in the history of sport. And it's probably the most watched sports event in the world.\"\n\nHere in Paris, he played like this was the quest all along. He did not lose one set in the six matches he played, and was something verging on flawless today. He will be remembered for the numbers and the way he pads his Wikipedia page with records. But beyond that, he will be known for his constitution. Has any other athlete had more of a supernatural talent for meeting the moment?\n\nSpare thought for Alcaraz, he's clearly tennis's new star. At 21 years old, he was trying to become only the third player in tennis history to win the French Open, Wimbledon and Olympic gold. He came within a few points of doing so. But this defeat will sting. It will recall last summer, when Djokovic beat him in Cincinnati weeks after the Wimbledon tournament. Silver medal is, of course, a great feat, but Alcaraz came to win gold, and he was thwarted by his new rival, who also now leads him four to three in head-to-head matches.\n\nAs for Djokovic, what's next? The American hardcourt, including the U.S. Open where he is defending champion. At age 37, he has to be susceptible to time at some point. But we are not there yet. Today will go down as one of the great feats of his career, which, of course, is saying something. He wore a permanent smile as he accepted his gold medal in late afternoon in Paris. It was hard not to notice there was still plenty of light in the sky.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Papyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2400,h_1350,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/si/01j4f7yqy8dymhhyg8ct.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

It took nearly three gruelling hours, and two spine-tingling tiebreaks, to win the one thing in tennis he had never won.\n\nWith a display for the ages that produced a 7-6(3), 7-6(2) win over Spain's Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday afternoon at Roland Garros, Serbia's Novak Djokovic captured the Olympic gold medal in the men's singles, a prize he wanted more than any other and that had somehow eluded him during his unmatched, two-decade career.\n\nWhen the moment of triumph finally arrived, with a blasted inside-in forehand to the postage stamp corner of the court, Djokovic, 37, crouched to his knees and immediately succumbed to the first set of tears. He made his way to the net to embrace Alcaraz, who would soon be sobbing too, from heartbreak rather than elation.\n\nAnd then Djokovic embarked on the kind of impromptu outpouring of emotion that reminded the world that even after more than $100million (\u00a3128m) in prize money, 24 Grand Slam singles titles and a lock on the unofficial greatest-player-of-the-modern-era title, the Olympic gold medal was his white whale.\n\nIt was the thing that made his career feel incomplete. It was incomplete no more.\n\nDjokovic went to the center of the court and knelt in prayer, crossing his chest, his closed eyes looking skyward with his arms raised in the air. He crouched on the clay, crying more, his hands trembling.\n\nHe rose and headed for the stands, where his wife, Jelena, and his children, Tara and Stefan, waited for him a few rows up from the court. Tara grabbed him around his neck first, turning her father into a puddle, as Jelena and Stefan joined in the embrace.\n\nJust two months ago, in this same city, he lay on an operating table as surgeons worked on the torn meniscus that had ended his French Open title defense ahead of his quarterfinal match. Now he was back at Roland Garros accomplishing the goal that he said mattered most to him when his season began -- a season that dragged on for months, filled mostly with frustration and injury, and definitely not filled with tournament wins.\n\nAll that ended in the bright, late afternoon sun on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where Djokovic has won the French Open three times. Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, placed the gold medal around his neck.\n\nDjokovic kissed it over and over and held it up, to his family and to the rest of the crowd, who chanted his name from the first moments of the match.\n\n\"The most special feeling,\" Djokovic said later. He had thought carrying his country's flag in the opening ceremony in 2012 was the greatest experience of his sporting life.\n\n\"This supersedes everything I can imagine,\" he said.\n\nA little more than a year ago, the Paris crowd had watched him win his then record-breaking 23rd Grand Slam. On Sunday, they came to see him accomplish a more personal version of history.\n\nBarely anyone gave him a significant chance to beat Alcaraz, who has won two Grand Slam titles in the last two months and, at 21, has achieved a level of awe-inducing primacy. He plays a version of tennis with which few, if any, are familiar. Djokovic found a way to deliver anyway.\n\nAlcaraz gave Djokovic all he could handle, drawing from him a level he has only had to find against the all-time greats from his era - Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal; Stan Wawrinka and Andy Murray too.\n\nFrom the first balls Sunday afternoon, it was clear that Djokovic and Alcaraz had come to play, and nothing less than their best was going to beat the other one.\n\nThis was nothing like last month's Wimbledon final, when Djokovic, 39 days removed from knee surgery, came out flat and Alcaraz blew him off the court.\n\nThis was still the Alcaraz who blasts nearly every backhand and forehand he can while mixing in the world's softest and most deceptive drop shot. But this time he met the Djokovic who chases down more balls than anyone and gets them back with the quality that switches him from defense to offense in the blink of an eye. This was a case of shared intensity raising things, less so than shared stakes. Alcaraz has many more Olympic Games in him; this is likely Djokovic's last.\n\nThey guided laser serves onto the lines in crucial moments. They sprinted to drop-shot returns that traveled nearly parallel to the net. Djokovic moaned through the points he desperately needed. Alcaraz grunted on the forehands he lashed into the deepest corners, from 200 feet away sounding like he was yelling into your ear.\n\nAlcaraz could sense in the first games that this was a different Djokovic than he had faced in a long while.\n\n\"I had in front of me a really hungry Novak,\" he said later, after the sadness of letting down the Spanish people had turned to pride and satisfaction for the effort he had made.\n\n\"I'm leaving this tournament with my head held high. I gave everything I could on the court today.\"\n\nBoth of them did. The first set lasted 93 minutes. The second one went 77.\n\n\"I don't think I ever played that level for three hours,\" he said, shaking his head with disbelief at what he had just been through. Only the occasional decision -- going cross-court over down-the-line, playing a drop-shot or lob ahead of a pass -- went awry. The ultimate difference was Djokovic, who found his best tennis in saving break points and converting opportunities; Alcaraz could only do the former.\n\nIt was still, almost, enough, and it took nothing less than two of Djokovic's signature, mistake-free tiebreaks to win the match. A single error in either, and a different color medal may have found itself around his neck.\n\nHe clinched the first by chasing balls all over the clay and lunging for a forehand drop volley that not even the fastest player in the game bothered to chase.\n\nIn the second one, the player with arguably the greatest backhand ever hit four of the most perfect forehands of his career when everything was on the line.\n\nThe first came on the very first point, in a full-sprint across the baseline. He unleashed an outrageous curling cross-court short, on the kind of angle familiar to anyone who watched when he first began redrawing the dimensions of the court two years ago.\n\nFour points later, he did it once more, again heading to his right and ripping cross-court, the kind of \"hit-it-like-you-mean it\" (his words from long ago) stroke that he crushed for winner down match point against Roger Federer in the U.S. Open semifinal in 2011.\n\nSame shot. Same result.\n\nThere would be another lethal forehand on the next point, inside-in, to the postage stamp corner to set up an overhead. And then there was one last one, its destination obvious even before his arm started moving forward. Inside-in again that corner again and, once more, Alcaraz was unable to get it back.\n\n\"The intensity of the emotions I felt at that moment was something I never felt before,\" Djokovic said.\n\nThe pressure had been building for 16 years, with the intensity of the expectations from his country to deliver them a gold medal growing ever higher. Alcaraz, too, said, the pressure of the Olympics was so much different than anything he had endured, knowing that even the best players with the longest careers only get a handful of chances to win a gold medal.\n\nDjokovic felt a first release when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the semifinals. Surpassing his bronze medal from 2008, he collapsed on his back and celebrated like he had won the tournament.\n\nAfter that win, he spoke in a way that suggested he had figured out how to convince himself that Alcaraz was beatable, despite the bludgeoning he had received three weeks before.\n\nOf course Alcaraz was the favorite. He'd won the last two Grand Slams. His Wimbledon title, coming off the French Open, is no less a transfer of power in tennis for this result.\n\nBut Djokovic believed he was a different player now, three more weeks removed from knee surgery. He was moving and striking the ball better, and that was before Sunday, when the thump-pop off his racket sounded like it hadn't sounded all year, and maybe longer than that.\n\n\"I feel more confident about myself and my chances in the finals,\" he had said.\n\nIn other words, somehow the world had completely changed in less than a month, at least in his mind, even if it really hadn't. And this was the Olympics, he said. Best-of-three sets -- \"anybody's game.\"\n\nThere were doubts, of course. There always are.\n\n\"But the belief and the conviction I can make it is stronger than my doubt,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the Games, he had told Bach not to count him out for Los Angeles in 2028, when he will be 41. He said it once more with the gold medal around his neck and the Serbian flag over his shoulders Sunday evening, before quickly shifting his thoughts back to the present, something few have ever done better on the tennis court.\n\nBeyond the Gumby-like flexibility and agility and the lightning-quick reflexes, that is his true superpower.\n\n\"It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew it was going to happen, I just didn't know when.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

Too proud. Too happy. Thrilled with the possibility to fight for a gold and to win a gold for the first time in my career for my country. Arguably, the biggest success I ever had,\" said Djokovic to Peacock TV reporter Brittany Eurton moments after his victory. \"Of course, I won everything that is to win, probably, in my individual career, but winning Davis Cup and particularly gold medal at Olympic Games for Serbia at age 37 is unprecedented.\"\n\n\"I'm super grateful for the blessing to win a historic gold medal for my country to complete the Golden Slam, to complete all the records,\" he continued.\n\nThe winner of 24 career major singles titles, a record among men, the man from Serbia had yet to win the gold medal at the Olympic Games as he entered his fifth career Olympiad this year. The \"Career Golden Grand Slam\" had only been won by two other men, Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal, and two women, Steffi Graf and Serena Williams, since tennis returned to the Olympic program in 1988. It was the main focus for Djokovic for years, who holds an immense pride playing for his country.\n\nDjokovic tripped near the finish line three previous times, losing Olympic semifinals in 2008 to Nadal, in 2012 to Andy Murray and in 2021 to Alexander Zverev (all the eventual Gold Medalists). He also tripped at the starting line in 2016, falling in the first round of the event to eventual silver medalist Juan Martin del Potro.\n\nDjokovic entered the 2024 Olympic Games on shaky ground, having not won a tournament all year (having won 98 in his career previously) while also having to undergo knee surgery after an injury in his fourth round match at the French Open, causing him to withdraw from the tournament. His status for Wimbledon and the Olympics were in doubt but a miraculous recovery helped him compete in both, losing to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final and winning the Gold over Alcaraz in Paris.\n\n\"It's a staggering achievement considering his fitness level this year and the fact he hadn't won one tournament this year,\" said Mary Carillo on the Peacock TV coverage of the final. \"It's the only hole in his resume and it's filled.\"\n\n\"He's the greatest tennis player we have ever seen play this game,\" said Rennae Stubbs on Peacock \"For him to finally to get this reward of a gold medal. There is no one more deserving of singles gold medal at the Olympics, his fifth attempt at doing so. He loves his country so, so much.\"\n\n\"There was no tournament, no victory that was going to be more important to Novak Djokovic this year than this one,\" Stubbs continued. \"He has own every Grand Slam title. He holds the record for the most. There is nothing more important than what he has done today.\"\n\nIn addition to all four major singles titles and now the Olympics, Djokovic has also won all nine of the elite \"Masters 1000\" level events on the ATP Tour, the only man to do so, as well as the year-end ATP World Tour Finals championship.

It is a rare one in which it is not only a battle of generations, but also one which is very competitive and entertaining.\n\nFrom thrilling rallies to emotional outbursts, the Alcaraz-Djokovic rivalry has already produced some memorable moments. On head-to-head, both the players are tied at 3-3. So there isn't much to choose between them.\n\nOne of the most iconic moments came after a grueling Cincinnati final in 2023. Where Djokovic narrowly defeated Alcaraz. Exhausted yet impressed by his young opponent's tenacity, Djokovic uttered, \"Boy, you don't give up, Jesus Christ.\"\n\nAlcaraz took this comment well, and replied saying \"Spanish never die\", this reminded Novak of his all time rival, Rafael Nadal. He added saying that he has heard this one before. This comment highlighted not only the physical demands of their matches but also the deep respect the two champions have for each other.\n\nAnother unforgettable incident occurred during the Wimbledon 2023 final. In a moment of sheer frustration, Djokovic smashed his racket, a rare sight that underscored the immense pressure and high stakes of their rivalry. The image of Djokovic's shattered racket became symbolic of the fierce competition between him and Alcaraz.\n\nIn the Wimbledon 2024 final, Alcaraz was outstanding on the day. One of his passing shots stunned Djokovic as he was left to applaud like the spectators did. The Spaniard was a much improved player from the 2023 final, showing better composure as well as skill.\n\nIn fact, some of the shots he played, reminded many of Djokovic himself such as the backhand down the line, to which hardly any opponent has had answers to, over the years.\n\nThe opening game of that same Wimbledon 2024 final was another highlight, setting the stage for an epic battle. The game took as many as 14 minutes to complete and it saw Alcaraz breaking Djokovic's serve. It proved to be a vital moment in the match as it gave the young Spaniard a lot of momentum and psychological advantage.\n\nDjokovic won the French Open 2023 semifinal but it came at the cost of Alcaraz injuring himself during the match, so he was far from 100 percent.\n\nHowever, the Serb was sporting enough after the match to claim that Alcaraz is still young and will win many Grand Slams in the future. And the Spaniard fulfilled his prophecy by ironically Djokovic only, in 2 Wimbledon finals.\n\nAt the time of writing this report, Djokovic won the first set in a tiebreak, 7-6 but was 2-2 in the second set against Alcaraz in the Olympics gold medal match on August 4.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rishika_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rishika Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic poetry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/3d915445-djokovic-alcaraz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 2650, "textEnd": 2658}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Still in disbelief. He eventually lifted his head up and pointed to the sky.\n\nWhen he walked to sit in his chair, some 50 seconds later, he leaned back with a towel on his face and sobbed.\n\nMore than 20 years after his first match victory on the ATP Tour, 16 years after his debut major title, and in his fifth Olympic appearance, Djokovic had finally achieved the one title, the one line on his resume, that had eluded him:\n\nOlympic gold medalist.\n\nHe had needed tiebreaks in both sets to defeat Carlos Alcaraz, his 21-year-old rival from Spain, who had defeated him in the Wimbledon final just three weeks earlier. The two had battled with one electric rally after another. But after two hours and 50 minutes, it was Djokovic who would emerge victorious, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2).\n\nAs he cried with his family in the stands -- his body shaking as he clutched onto his children and the Serbian flag -- and when he proudly sang the national anthem on the medal podium, it was clear this moment meant everything to him. Even to a man who had achieved virtually everything else in the sport, including a record-tying 24 Grand Slam titles, bringing home the gold medal to his beloved country was a life's dream accomplished.\n\n\"I'm just over the moon. Honestly, everything that I felt in that moment when I won really surpassed everything I thought or hoped that it [was] going to be,\" Djokovic told a room full of reporters on Sunday night, with the gold medal still around his neck and the Serbian flag wrapped around his shoulders. \"I thought carrying the flag at the [2012 Olympic] opening ceremony was the best feeling ever until I experienced today. Being on that court with Serbian flag raising and singing [the] Serbian anthem and wearing the gold [medal] around my neck, I think nothing can beat that in terms of professional sport.\"\n\nDJOKOVIC HAS HISTORICALLY struggled at the Olympics. He won a bronze medal in singles during his debut in 2008 but, until Sunday, had never made his way back to the podium.\n\nBut he won just about everything else. So much so, when he arrived in Tokyo in 2021, he was on a quest for the ultra-exclusive Golden Slam, in which he was attempting to win all four Slams and Olympic singles gold. He had won the Australian Open, the French Open and Wimbledon and advanced to the semifinals at the Games. After easily taking the first set over Alexander Zverev, 6-1, it all came apart. He won just four games in the final two sets and his hopes of joining just Steffi Graf (1988) for the feat were dashed. He lost in the bronze medal match too, and then had his calendar Grand Slam dreams squashed at the US Open in the final.\n\nSince then, he's become the winningest man in major history and tied Margaret Court's longstanding record for the most Slam singles titles, and made a case for his \"GOAT\" (greatest of all-time) status. However, this season hasn't gone to plan.\n\nBefore arriving in Paris for the Olympics, he hadn't won a Slam this season, nor had he won a title of any kind. It marked his worst start of a season since 2006. He had injured his knee during the French Open -- at Roland Garros, the same site of the Olympics -- and was forced to withdraw ahead of his quarterfinal match. He underwent surgery for a torn medial meniscus in his right knee on June 5, initially putting his status for Wimbledon in jeopardy.\n\nBut he returned in time for the tournament, only to have his run at the All England Club ruined, for the second year in a row, by Alcaraz in a lopsided straight-set contest. Still, even hours after the loss, he remained hopeful for the Olympics.\n\n\"Let's see how physically and mentally I'm going to feel,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can find the right tennis because I'm going to need all I have and more to go to the final of the Olympic Games.\"\n\nPerhaps helped by the slower court speed of the clay, or of the best-of-three-set format, Djokovic has played some of his best tennis of the season this week in Paris. He defeated longtime foe and 14-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal in the second round, two-time major finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals, and the surging Lorenzo Musetti, who ultimately claimed the bronze medal, in the semifinals.\n\nOn Sunday, the near-capacity crowd split their loyalties, often chanting for both players at the same time and resulting in an indiscernible mashup of their names. Djokovic fought for every point. While Alcaraz's youth, speed and dazzling ability to cover the court were on display throughout, Djokovic was patient and methodical and, despite occasional moments of frustration, held him off with his own signature ball striking and movement. Serbian fans, several of whom were wearing variations of fake gold medals, shouted \"Idemo,\" his trademark phrase of encouragement, at him during crucial moments.\n\nThroughout his run at Roland Garros, he never dropped a set and joined Serena Williams -- who was in attendance on Sunday -- as the only singles champions since tennis was reintroduced at the Olympics in 1988 to do so en route to the gold medal. He became Serbia's second medalist of the 2024 Games and he is now just the fifth tennis player to achieve the career Golden Slam, joining Graff, Andre Agassi, Nadal and Williams.\n\nA still ecstatic and reflective Djokovic admitted the struggles he's had at the Olympics in the past and the challenges he's faced this season only made Sunday's victory even more special.\n\n\"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience and that I could feel,\" Djokovic said. \"The fact that I won the bronze in [my] first Olympic Games and ever since then failed to win the medal and played three out of four Olympic Games in semifinals and couldn't overcome that obstacle. And then now at age 37, [playing against a] 21-year-old, that is probably the best player in the world right now, [who won] Roland Garros, [won] back-to-back at Wimbledon, and [is] playing incredible tennis.\n\n\"Just when I take everything in consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I've ever had in my career.\"\n\nWith nothing left to prove, and with no elusive title left to chase, Djokovic admitted his career was in some ways complete, but said he had no plans of walking away anytime soon. Mentioning he hadn't ruled out the possibility of competing at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles as members of his team laughed in the corner of the room, and jokingly defused a question about running for the Serbian presidency, Djokovic said he was just trying to enjoy what he had worked so hard to achieve.\n\n\"I love this sport,\" he said. \"I don't play it only to win the tournament. I play it because I really love competition ... I don't know about the future, to be honest. I really want to be in the present moment to celebrate. [I] worked very hard, sacrificed a lot to be in this moment. It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal. So now it's about happiness, joy and celebration.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "d_arcy_maine@espn.com", "name": "D'Arcy Maine",

Serbian fans, several of whom were wearing variations of fake gold medals, shouted \"Idemo,\" his trademark phrase of encouragement, during crucial moments.\n\nThroughout his run at Roland Garros, he never dropped a set, joining Serena Williams -- who was in attendance on Sunday -- as the only singles champions since tennis was reintroduced at the Olympics in 1988 to do so en route to the gold medal. He became Serbia's second medalist of the 2024 Games and he is now just the fifth tennis player to achieve the career Golden Slam, joining Graff, Nadal, Williams and Andre Agassi.\n\nA still ecstatic and reflective Djokovic said his past struggles at the Olympics and the challenges he faced this season only made Sunday's victory even more special.\n\n\"This kind of supersedes everything that I imagined, that I hoped that I could experience and that I could feel,\" Djokovic said. \"The fact that I won the bronze in [my] first Olympic Games and ever since then failed to win the medal and played three out of four Olympic Games in semifinals and couldn't overcome that obstacle. And then now at age 37, [playing against a] 21-year-old, that is probably the best player in the world right now, [who won] Roland Garros, [won] back-to-back at Wimbledon, and [is] playing incredible tennis.\n\n\"Just when I take everything in consideration, this probably is the biggest sporting success I've ever had in my career.\"\n\nWith nothing left to prove, and with no elusive title left to chase, Djokovic admitted his career was in some ways complete, but said he had no plans of walking away anytime soon. He said he hadn't ruled out the possibility of competing at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles as members of his team laughed in the corner of the room, and after jokingly defusing a question about running for the Serbian presidency, Djokovic said he was just trying to enjoy what he had worked so hard to achieve.\n\n\"I love this sport,\" he said. \"I don't play it only to win the tournament. I play it because I really love competition. ... I don't know about the future, to be honest. I really want to be in the present moment to celebrate. [I] worked very hard, sacrificed a lot to be in this moment. It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal. So now it's about happiness, joy and celebration.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "d_arcy_maine@espn.co.uk", "name": "D'Arcy Maine",

The Serbian's only previous Olympics medal came way back in 2008, when he clinched bronze in Beijing.\n\nAt the Tokyo Games three years ago, Djokovic lost to Alcaraz's fellow countryman Pablo Carreno Busta in the bronze medal match. He also missed out on bronze at London 2012.\n\nBut the seven-time Wimbledon champion drew upon all of his experience and nous to get the better of his younger opponent, 16 years his junior, in the French capital - and the emotion poured out as he sealed the win.\n\nShortly before collecting his gold medal on the podium, Djokovic shared a touching moment with his daughter, Tara, as he joined his loved ones in the crowd inside Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nDuring the phenomenal battle, which lasted nearly three hours, Tara held aloft a sign which read, 'Dad is the best'.\n\nAlcaraz, who overcame Djokovic in the Wimbledon final earlier this summer, broke down in tears several times and even had to pause his interview with Eurosport just moments after the defeat.\n\nAfter he was able to compose himself, a teary Alcaraz said: 'Three hours of phenomenal fight. It was a big battle. It's never easy.\n\n'There were tough moments for me in the tie break. I just couldn't get my level up. It's very painful to lose today.'\n\nA near-speechless Djokovic said he was still in a state of 'shock' after ending his Olympic hoodoo at long last.\n\n'It was an incredible battle, incredible fight. Honestly, when the last shot went through him, past him, that was the only moment I actually thought I could win the match,' Djokovic said after shortly after his victory.\n\n'I believed I could win but to actually win it... he [Alcaraz] keeps on coming back, he keeps on asking me to play my best tennis.\n\n'I thought I started the first set well, I had chances, he had chances as well. It was probably fair to finish both sets with a tie break, to be honest.\n\n'We both had our chances to break but when it mattered we both came out with big serves, some big plays. I don't know what to say, I'm still in shock.'\n\nAsked why the win was so special to him, Djokovic replied: 'It's everything but most of all it's my country.\n\n'Most of all it's the pride to play for Serbia. Carlos, Rafa [Nadal], they love to play for Spain. Andy [Murray] loves to play for Great Britain, Roger [Federer] for Switzerland, Alex Zverev won in Tokyo for Germany.\n\n'You saw the reactions of all of these guys when they win. It's something special, honestly.\n\n'This is my fifth Olympic Games and three out of four Olympic Games I played semi-finals and never managed to overcome that hurdle for some reason.'\n\nMORE : Olympics fans raging as BBC coverage of 'historic' Djokovic vs Alcaraz tennis final abruptly stops\n\nMORE : Yes, you can still visit Paris and avoid the Olympics crowds", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_olver@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Olver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Carre\u00f1o_Busta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/comp-1722788732.png?crop=0px%2C39px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

On Sunday, August 4, the 37-year-old defeated Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-2) at the Philippe-Chatrier in the gold medal match. He also became the oldest Olympic champion in tennis. Alcaraz had the chance to become the youngest Olympic winner in tennis, but that was not the case.\n\nAlcaraz did not have the smoothest of starts to the opening set as he saved a break point to hold his serve. He again found himself on the backfoot as Djokovic earned three break points, but the Spaniard saved all of them to make it 2-2. In the next game, Alcaraz had the chance to break Djokovic's serve, but the Serb saved all of them and held his serve with an overhead winner.\n\nThe ninth game turned out to be an absolute thriller. Djokovic saved as many as five break points to eventually hold his serve and make it 5-4. The veteran found himself on the backfoot quite a few times, but found a way to bail himself out. It went down to the wire where Djokovic fetched a set point, but Alcaraz saved it to force a tie-breaker.\n\nEven in the tie-breaker, it was neck-on-neck at 3-3, but Djokovic won four points in a row and claimed the opening set in an hour and 34 minutes with a forehand volley. Alcaraz would be gutted after failing to convert even one of his eight break point chances.\n\nThe second set started similarly where both Alcaraz and Djokovic kept each other on their toes. Alcaraz saved a break point in the third game to stay alive in the match. At 3-3, it again seemed that the set would go right down to the wire.\n\nAlcaraz gave himself a great chance of going 5-4 up with three game points, but then Djokovic saved all three of them. However, Alcaraz won the game to keep breathing.

Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday to claim a maiden Olympic title and become just the fifth player to complete a career Golden Slam.\n\nThe 37-year-old Serb, competing in his fifth Games, came through 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) in an enthralling final at Roland Garros to add Olympic gold to his 24 Grand Slam triumphs.\n\nVictory allowed him to join Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Steffi Graf and the watching Serena Williams as the only players to win all four Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic singles gold.\n\nHe also became the oldest singles champion since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988 and shattered Alcaraz's bid to add gold to the French Open and Wimbledon titles he has already pocketed this summer.\n\nAn emotional Djokovic celebrated by holding aloft the Serbian flag on court before clambering into the players' box to embrace his wife and children.\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" said Djokovic, who had lost heavily to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final last month.\n\n- 'Finally I did it' -\n\n\"I put my body, my family on the line to win gold and finally I did it.\"\n\nAlcaraz was distraught and wept as he attempted to conduct a TV interview.\n\n\"Three hours, a big battle with tough moments,\" said the 21-year-old after a final in which neither player dropped serve. \"It's very painful to lose.\"\n\nDjokovic carved out a break point in the second game of the opener and three more in the fourth, all saved by the Spaniard.\n\nThen it was the Serb's turn to demonstrate his famed powers of resilience, fighting off three break points in the fifth game and another five in a marathon ninth game.\n\nIn a rollercoaster duel, Alcaraz saved a set point in the 12th game but his veteran opponent dominated the tiebreak to claim the opener after a breathless 93 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThere was no let-up in the second set, scintillating shot-making alongside rousing defence with Alcaraz fighting off the final's 14th break point in the third game.\n\nAgain the set was decided by a tie-break and it was Djokovic with history on the line again sweeping through to take victory after two hours and 50 minutes.\n\nLorenzo Musetti defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets on Saturday to claim the bronze medal, giving Italy its first men's tennis medal in 100 years.\n\nLater Sunday, Russian athletes can claim their first gold of the Games when Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider face the Italian team of Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini in the women's doubles.\n\nRussian competitors are taking part in the Olympics as neutrals following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022.\n\nIf Andreeva and Shnaider win gold, their achievement will not be recognised in the medals table while both the Russian flag and national anthem will be banned from the podium ceremony.\n\nCristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo, the Spanish eighth seeds, defeated the Czech pair of Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-2 in the bronze medal match.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Out of all of Novak Djokovic's staggering successes at the top of the tennis game, arguably none triggered the same level emotional outpouring from Serbia's favourite son as Sunday's Paris 2024 Olympics men's singles final.\n\nThe 37-year-old had been on a personal mission for Games stardom for over 16 years since nabbing the final place on the podium at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, since when a coveted gold perpetually eluded him.\n\nLondon 2012 and Tokyo 2020 were excruciating near-misses for Djokovic, who just missed out on a medal on both occasions, but the 24-time major winner exorcised all of his Olympic demons in a two-hour and 50-minute marathon on Sunday.\n\nReuniting with second seed Carlos Alcaraz just a few weeks on from his thrashing at the hands of the Spaniard in the Wimbledon final, Djokovic prevailed 7-6[3] 7-6[2] to achieve a lifelong dream, and nobody could knock him for exploding in elation after firing a brilliant forehand winner past Alcaraz on match point.\n\nFrom the customary collapse onto the clay to visibly shaking and letting out roar after roar, Djokovic's opened-mouthed expression represented years and years of Olympics anguish for the 37-year-old, who has added a few more pages of history to his ever-growing list.\n\nAs well as becoming the first Serbian to win an Olympic gold medal in tennis, doing so without dropping a set to boot, Djokovic is the oldest man or woman to win a singles title since the sport was reinstated to the Games in 1988.\n\nThe 24-time major winner is also the first man to ever complete a career Big Titles sweep, having won Olympic gold, all four Grand Slams, the year-end finals and all Masters Championships.\n\nFurthermore, Djokovic has joined Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal in the Career Golden Slam club (all four majors and the Olympics), while only the former had ever achieved the Career Super Slam (all four majors, Olympics and year-end Finals) in the men's game before Sunday's final.\n\nHow did Djokovic win his Olympic gold?\n\nTaking the match by the scruff of the neck early doors, Djokovic missed four break points across Alcaraz's opening two service games, before having to fight back from 40-0 down on serve to hold for a 3-2 lead.\n\nExceptional defending was required from the Serbian in the ninth game, where he brilliantly beat away five Alcaraz break opportunities to hold for 5-4, and despite missing one set point, he was unflappable in the tie-breaker.\n\nThe action could hardly have been more tense in the second set, where both men managed just one break point between them -

First, he was not a shoo-in to win, despite being the GOAT of men's singles tennis. The 37-year-old, who has spent much of the year dealing with knee issues, was facing Carlos Alcaraz, the 21-year-old Spanish phenom who beat Djokovic in the Wimbledon finals just last month.\n\nThe second surprise was his intensely emotional reaction to winning. When he scored the final point, he let out a mighty yell, raising his arms to the sky and dropping his racket. That's par for the course for Djokovic. But it was after he went to greet Alcaraz at the net that his emotions began to set in. He fell to his knees on the red clay and then rested on his elbows, his head buried in his hands and his chest heaving with emotion.\n\nAfter a few moments he rocked back on his knees and raised his hands to the sky. Sobbing, he made the sign of the cross. Djokovic was then led up into the stands, where he immediately grabbed his young daughter as his wife, son and team encircled him in an enormous hug. He had finally accomplished his dream.\n\nAt this point, even the most casual tennis fans have seen Djokovic win a tournament. He collapses on the ground, he jumps and shouts, he hugs his family and his team. It's not rote, but it is routine. He's won every Grand Slam multiple times. He owns the record for most men's Grand Slam wins in tennis history, and is tied with Margaret Court for the all-time record (24).\n\nThat's why his response was so unexpected. After winning the bronze in 2008 at the age of 21, then finishing fourth in 2012 and 2021, he really wanted to win gold. And it felt like the first time in a long while that he was willing to let the world see part of him that isn't perfect and composed. He wanted something, failed, had to fight for it, and finally came out on top. That's one of the most human stories there is.\n\nDjokovic's place in tennis history, and all that he's accomplished, is what makes his response so resonant and so touching. The Olympics don't matter to tennis (neither the WTA or the ATP award ranking points for the Games), but the Olympics matter to him. It wasn't just another notch in his Grand Slam belt. He wanted to win the gold medal for himself and Serbia.\n\nHe almost lost it a few times. There were moments you could almost feel that desperate recklessness hiding just underneath the surface, ready to shove him off balance. He yelled at his box, accusing them of staying quiet and failing to help him when he needed it. He looked at Alcaraz in bewilderment, shaking his head every time he turned one of Djokovic's winners into a winner of his own.\n\nBut Djokovic never broke. He never panicked. He never gave up. Faced with a 21-year-old at the very beginning of what has already been an exciting and accomplished career, the 37-year-old drew on every lesson he'd ever learned in tennis, every bit of experience he'd gained, every ounce of stamina he could muster. Beating Alcaraz wasn't just about the tennis on the court. It was about his mind. Which player could better withstand the pressure?\n\nOn Sunday, it was Djokovic. The crowd was slightly tilted toward Alcaraz, but it was clear they wanted to be entertained by great tennis more than anything else. Djokovic hasn't always gotten full-throated support at Roland Garros, but the crowd was 100% behind him when the last point was scored. They roared in appreciation and celebration as the greatest men's tennis player of all time finally fulfilled his dream of winning an Olympic gold medal.\n\nAt that moment, there was no tomorrow. No thoughts of his next tournament, or the US Open, or his knee injury, or even Carlos Alcaraz. There was just Djokovic, crumpled on the red clay, doing what thousands of Olympians across the world have done before him: weeping with joy, shouting with excitement, screaming with pride, desperate to embrace the people who helped him every single day on his journey.\n\nThere are many Djokovic moments that will live on in memory. But this, his late-career Olympic gold medal, will be a standout in 10, 20, 30 years. It represents so much about the spirit of tennis and the true nature of dedication and commitment. But it also represents so much about Djokovic: For a man who has always been dedicated to being the outlier, the exception, the different one, his most touching moment came when he simply let his true emotions shine through and let them carry him away.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Court", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_sports_boston_video_386/43f8c348ca930f00dc1df10b5ded7a69", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Now at the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had.\"\n\nDjokovic's victory on Sunday places him alongside Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Steffi Graf, and Serena Williams as the only players to win all four Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic singles gold, completing the career Golden Slam.\n\nBefore defeating Alcaraz, Djokovic's best Olympic result was a bronze medal in 2008 at Beijing. He had also lost in three semi-finals. He now aims to continue playing and has not dismissed the possibility of competing for back-to-back golds in Los Angeles in four years.\n\n\"I want to play in Los Angeles, I enjoy playing for my country in the Olympic Games, in the Davis Cup,\" he added. Djokovic, the oldest singles champion since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, thwarted Alcaraz's bid to add gold to his French Open and Wimbledon titles from this summer.\n\nAn emotional Djokovic fell to his knees on Court Philippe Chatrier, where he has won three French Opens, before lifting the Serbian flag and joining his wife and children in the players' box.\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" said Djokovic. Sunday's title was the 99th of his career and his first in 2024, after a challenging season where Jannik Sinner succeeded him as Australian Open champion and eventually took his world number one spot.\n\nAlcaraz then beat him at the French Open and denied him the chance to equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon titles. A knee injury at the French Open required surgery, and Djokovic's participation in the Olympic semi-finals was briefly in doubt when he seemed to aggravate the injury.\n\n\"I knew that this could be my last chance of a gold medal,\" Djokovic said at his post-final press conference, still draped in his country's flag and with his medal proudly around his neck.\n\n\"I did everything I possibly could to prepare myself for this period. The injury sidetracked me a little bit. But coming into the Olympic Games, I felt like a different player in terms of how I moved, how I played.

(AFP) Novak Djokovic defeated Carlos Alcaraz yesterday to claim a maiden Olympic title and become just the fifth player to complete a career Golden Slam.\n\nThe 37-year-old Serb, competing in his fifth Games, came through 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) in an enthralling final at Roland Garros to add Olympic gold to his 24 Grand Slam triumphs.\n\nVictory allowed him to join Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Steffi Graf and the watching Serena Williams as the only players to win all four Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic singles gold.\n\nHe also became the oldest singles champion since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988 and shattered Alcaraz's bid to add gold to the French Open and Wimbledon titles he has already pocketed this summer.\n\nAn emotional Djokovic celebrated by holding aloft the Serbian flag on court before clambering into the players' box to embrace his wife and children.\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" said Djokovic, who had lost heavily to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final last month.\n\n\"I put my body, my family on the line to win gold and finally I did it.\"\n\nAlcaraz was distraught and wept as he attempted to conduct a TV interview. \"Three hours, a big battle with tough moments,\" said the 21-year-old after a final in which neither player dropped serve. \"It's very painful to lose.\"\n\nDjokovic carved out a break point in the second game of the opener and three more in the fourth, all saved by the Spaniard.\n\nThen it was the Serb's turn to demonstrate his famed powers of resilience, fighting off three break points in the fifth game and another five in a marathon ninth game. In a rollercoaster duel, Alcaraz saved a set point in the 12th game but his veteran opponent dominated the tiebreak to claim the opener after a breathless 93 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThere was no let-up in the second set, scintillating shot-making alongside rousing defence with Alcaraz fighting off the final's 14th break point in the third game.\n\nAgain the set was decided by a tie-break and it was Djokovic with history on the line again sweeping through to take victory after two hours and 50 minutes.\n\nLorenzo Musetti defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets on Saturday to claim the bronze medal, giving Italy its first men's tennis medal in 100 years.\n\nLater in the day, Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider became the first Russians to win a medal at the Paris Olympics when they took silver in the women's doubles.\n\nPlaying as neutrals, they were beaten in three sets in the final by Italy's Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini. Andreeva, 17, and 20-year-old Shnaider, playing their first event as a team, went down to a 2-6, 6-1, 10-7 defeat to the experienced Italians in the final.\n\nThey had knocked out defending Olympic champions and second seeds Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova in the quarter-finals. Andreeva and Shnaider are both top 25 players in singles.\n\nAt this year's French Open, the 17-year-old was the youngest player to reach the semi-finals since 1997.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Shnaider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana Shnaider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbora_Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate\u0159ina_Siniakov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Errani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sara Errani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2024/08/04/thumbs/300x300/207436.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The Serbian has defied expectations time and time again, including from surgery for a torn meniscus in the French Open, only to bounce back as a Wimbledon finalist and Olympic winner within two months.\n\nNot that he has much left to prove.\n\nA 25th slam would push him past Australia's Margaret Court, who won most of her 24 titles in the less competitive pre-Open era, to become the sole holder of that record.\n\nDjokovic was asked whether he had \"completed\" tennis, like it was some sort of video game.\n\n\"Yes it's complete because I completed all the achievements with this gold medal but no because I love this sport (and) don't play only to win the tournaments,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal so now it's about happiness, joy and celebration.\"\n\nAlcaraz was disconsolate after losing, unable to hold back tears.\n\n\"I think I put more pressure on myself because I was playing for Spain, for the Spaniards,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a different type of pressure ... everyone in Spain wanted me to win the gold, and I wanted to win the gold as well.\"\n\n\"I felt that I let the Spanish people down.\"\n\nNadal, Alcaraz's teammate in the Olympic doubles, was one of many to try to lift the Spaniard's spirits.\n\n\"Carlos, even though I know that today is a difficult day, value a medal that is very important for the whole country and you'll see, in time, that for you too,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nAlcaraz has won French hearts this fortnight by eschewing private accomodation used by other tennis stars to stay in the athletes village, where he has been mobbed by fellow competitors.\n\nCompleting the tennis program in Paris, Italian pair Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini won the women's doubles 2-6 6-1 (10-7) in a match tiebreaker.\n\nIn doing so, Errani claimed her own doubles Golden Slam after winning all four majors with Roberta Vinci a decade ago.\n\nBeaten pairing Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider, competing under a neutral flag, became the first Russians to medal in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "7news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "7NEWS.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The 24-time Grand Slam winner needs to win the Paris Olympic gold medal to complete a career golden slam but finds a worthy opponent in the form of Carlos Alcaraz in his way.\n\nWhile Alcaraz is still young and will have enough opportunities in the future to win an Olympic gold, Paris may well be Djokovic's last chance to win an Olympic gold as he is already in the twilight of his career.\n\nThe Roland Garros Stadium will witness the mouthwatering clash on Sunday (August 4) and fans of the sport are expected to mark their attendance in large numbers. Djokovic has already mentioned that competing in the final at the Olympics is a \"big deal\" and is happy to have secured a medal for Serbia in the ongoing edition.\n\n\"This dream is long lived and fought for. I wanted to compete in the finals of Olympic games for such a long time. Representing my country at a global event is a huge privilege and honor that I cherish. Serbia will have a medal on Sunday!!!

His clinical performance in both tie-breaks highlighted his experience and mental fortitude, proving decisive in the tightly contested match.\n\nDjokovic has recently lost to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final, going down 6-1, 6-7, 1-6, 6-3, 4-6 in five sets.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-08/371a7825-c519-42e7-8e60-ec01dec2d567/Novak Djokovic 10.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

For Novak Djokovic, gazing down at an Olympic gold medal that had long been elusive, the answer was priceless.\n\nThe problem with tennis players, goes the flawed logic, is the Olympics just don't matter to them, it's all Slams and 'show me the money'.\n\nDjokovic might have a record 24 major titles but none have been greeted with the scenes that followed his 7-6 7-6 win over Spain's Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros.\n\nStained by sweat and tears, he wrapped himself in a Serbian flag and then in the embrace of his family and friends, who he'd taken on a rollercoaster in the stands. Alcaraz just sobbed.\n\nDjokovic completed his career 'golden slam' in a ferocious contest - the opposite of the one-sided Wimbledon final the Spaniard won just three weeks ago.\n\nHe is just the fifth player to win the 'Golden Slam' in singles - all four majors and the Olympic title - after Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf.\n\n\"I was so blessed to win everything pretty much there is to win in my sport, but this is something different,\" said Djokovic, a remarkable 16 years separating his first Slam title in Australia and this gold medal.\n\n\"This supersedes everything that I've ever felt on the tennis court after winning big trophies, it's just incredible joy.\"\n\n\"It's hard to describe. I'm just so proud to be a part of an elite number of athletes that managed to win gold for their countries in their respective sports. They probably are the only ones that can really understand this feeling.\n\n\"Three out of four Olympic Games, I lost in the semi-finals. I won a bronze medal in Beijing, which was my first Olympic Games. I carried the flag for Serbia in 2012, in London, which was one of the best feelings I ever had in my life.\n\n\"I didn't know until now that there's even a better feeling, which is winning a gold for your country. I couldn't be prouder and happier. Playing for Serbia has always been my upmost, real pleasure, priority.\n\n\"After Beijing, there were three Olympic Games where I was coming in as one of the main, if not the main, favourites to win the gold, but I wasn't able to go through that last stage.\n\n\"I lost three out of four semifinals, just so much pressure; so much expectation coming into this year's Olympic Games as well.\n\n\"When I won the semifinals, I really felt a huge relief and I think that helped me come into this match with a bit more confidence and kind of swinging freer to win a medal. I really didn't feel like I had something to lose.\"\n\nIt's true that tennis took a while to be an Olympic hit - the first two men's champions, when the sport returned to the Games in 1988, were Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 and Marc Rosset.\n\nAndy Murray puts his two titles equal to his three Grand Slams, Roger Federer even says that about the men's doubles gold he won.\n\nDjokovic had made no secret this week was his priority for the season, some questioning why he was playing Wimbledon just a few weeks after knee surgery when this lurked so close on the horizon.\n\nHis former coach Boris Becker, commentating for Discovery+, was in no doubt last week that the player would rebound from his All England Club disappointment.\n\nHe claimed playing for Serbia gave Djokovic an 'extra ten percent', which he needed to take down Alcaraz in a brutal and attritional encounter, their matches now box office affairs.\n\n\"It was emotional, it wasn't the result that I wanted but I have to be really proud of myself for the level I played,\" said Alcaraz.\n\n\"He played an unbelievable game, from the first ball and to the last one, so I have to give credit to him. He's a champion.\"", "source": {"uri": "kidderminstershuttle.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kidderminster Shuttle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miloslav_Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rosset", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Rosset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Becker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boris Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.kidderminstershuttle.co.uk/resources/images/18384906/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

And that's the biggest battle to win.\n\n\"I'm super thrilled that I managed to do it here in the way that I did it, against a guy who is the best in the world at the moment. I'm just over the moon.\n\n\"Everything that I felt in that moment when I won really surpassed everything I thought or hoped that it would. I thought that carrying the flag at the opening ceremony (in London) was the best feeling ever until I experienced this today.\n\n\"And being on that court with the Serbian flag raising, singing the Serbian anthem, with the gold around my neck, I think nothing can beat that in terms of professional sport. It definitely stands out as the biggest sporting achievement I had.\"\n\nDjokovic's powers had appeared to be waning this season, with Alcaraz and fellow young gun Jannik Sinner taking charge, but he has not ruled out playing into his 40s and having another shot at the Olympics in 2028.\n\n\"I still want to play in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"I enjoy playing for my country and the Olympic Games particularly and Davis Cup, being part of the team.\"\n\nHe joins Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf as just the fifth player to complete the career Golden Slam of all four grand slam titles and Olympic singles gold.\n\nDjokovic still needs one more slam title to reach 25 and hold the all-time singles record, which could come at the US Open next month.\n\nOn whether he has 'completed' tennis, he added: \"Yes it's complete because I completed all the achievements with this gold medal but no because I love this sport. I don't play only to win the tournaments.\n\n\"I don't know about the future, I really want to be in the present moment to celebrate. It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal. So now it's about happiness, joy and celebration.\"\n\nThere was a remarkable intensity to the contest right from the start, with rallies of supreme quality and chances for both.\n\nAlcaraz recovered from 0-40 in the fourth game but then could not take any of eight break points, five of them at 4-4.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Carlos Alcaraz Garfia (@carlitosalcarazz)\n\nDjokovic seized control in the tie-break, winning the last four points of a 93-minute set and ending it with his fist raised in the air. The second set was just as tight but again it was the Serbian who found something extra when it really mattered.\n\nAlcaraz broke down in tears during a TV interview on court but was able to reflect later with pride on taking silver on his Olympic debut.\n\n\"In front of me I had a really hungry Novak,\" said the 21-year-old, who has won each of his four slam finals.\n\n\"His level was really, really high. He didn't let me take the chances. I'm really proud and I'm leaving the court and leaving the tournament with my head really, really high, knowing that I gave everything that I could.\n\n\"This tournament has been really special for me, I'm going to take it for the rest of my life. Playing with Rafa (Nadal), having those feelings, getting my first Olympic medal - hopefully not the last one.\"\n\nBronze went to Lorenzo Musetti, and Italy were able to celebrate gold in the women's

It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he has made clear that simply was not sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games.

To win Olympic gold at 37, I finally did it. Most of all, it's my country. The pride of playing for Serbia.\"\n\nHe joins Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf as just the fifth player to complete the career Golden Slam of all four grand slam titles and Olympic singles gold.\n\nThe boxing finals are due to take place next week at Roland Garros but this was a true heavyweight contest between the oldest and youngest Olympic men's singles finalists since tennis returned to the Games in 1988.\n\nAnticipation fizzed around a packed Court Philippe Chatrier, with Serena Williams among those watching from the stands as well as Djokovic's two children, who waved Serbian flags and home-made signs.\n\nDjokovic said after finally breaking his Olympic semi-final hoodoo that he felt like a different player to the one who lost rather tamely to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.\n\nThe Serbian's right knee no longer appears to be limiting him, bar a brief scare in the quarter-finals against Stefano Tsitsipas, and it was he who had the first chances of the final.\n\nAlcaraz trailed 0-40 in the fourth game as Djokovic stuck like glue to the baseline and piled on the pressure but the Spaniard was up to the task.\n\nIt was an extraordinary level of tennis, the pair outdoing each other with outrageous shot-making, but it was Alcaraz's enormous power that began to take charge.\n\nHe created eight break points, three at 2-2 then five more at 4-4, but Djokovic, on the ropes but not panicking, somehow withstood the onslaught.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs the clock ticked past the hour mark, Alcaraz saved a first set point, but Djokovic was not to be denied in the tie-break, winning the final four points.\n\nWhen his final lunging forehand volley landed in after 93 minutes of action, the 37-year-old stood for several seconds with his fist in the air, soaking in the cheers from his fans.\n\nAlcaraz had started to over-hit a little in a search of a way through Djokovic's defences, and his frustration grew in the second set as the finish line approached with nothing to split them.\n\nGoing into the tie-break, Djokovic knew one final effort would deliver the longed-for prize and two fizzing forehand winners gave him an early advantage that Alcaraz could not claw back.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

gets his hands on gold after beating Carlos Alcaraz", "body": "Novak Djokovic gained revenge on Carlos Alcaraz in a pulsating men's singles final to claim his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe Serbian first played in the Games back in 2008 but he arrived in Paris with only one bronze medal to show for his efforts and a burning desire to finally take his last chance to stand on the top step of the podium.\n\nHe lost in straight sets to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final only three weeks ago and had not won a title all season but, playing in the red of Serbia, the 37-year-old produced a superb performance to win 7-6 (3) 7-6 (2).\n\nWhen his final forehand found the corner, Djokovic dropped his racket and turned to his family in delight and disbelief before lying on the court, his ultimate goal finally realised.\n\nThe 37-year-old then climbed into the stands and cried uncontrollably as he embraced his family and supporters.\n\nHe joins Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf as just the fifth player to complete the career Golden Slam of all four grand slam titles and Olympic singles gold.\n\nThe boxing finals are due to take place next week at Roland Garros but this was a true heavyweight contest between the oldest and youngest Olympic men's singles finalists since tennis returned to the Games in 1988.\n\nAnticipation fizzed around a packed Court Philippe Chatrier, with Serena Williams among those watching from the stands as well as Djokovic's two children, who waved Serbian flags and home-made signs.\n\nThe Serbian's right knee no longer appears to be limiting him, bar a brief scare in the quarter-finals against Stefano Tsitsipas, and it was he who had the first chances of the final.\n\nAlcaraz trailed 0-40 in the fourth game as Djokovic stuck like glue to the baseline and piled on the pressure but the Spaniard was up to the task.\n\nIt was an extraordinary level of tennis, the pair outdoing each other with outrageous shot-making, but it was Alcaraz's enormous power that began to take charge.\n\nAs the clock ticked past the hour mark, Alcaraz saved a first set point, but Djokovic was not to be denied in the tie-break, winning the final four points.\n\nWhen his final lunging forehand volley landed in after 93 minutes of action, the 37-year-old stood for several seconds with his fist in the air, soaking in the cheers from his fans.\n\nAlcaraz had started to over-hit a little in a search of a way through Djokovic's defences, and his frustration grew in the second set as the finish line approached with nothing to split them.\n\nGoing into the tie-break, Djokovic knew one final effort would deliver the longed-for prize and two fizzing forehand winners gave him an early advantage that Alcaraz could not claw back.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type":

Today Novak Djokovic has crowned the dream of a lifetime, he has disposed of the pressure of a lifetime, winning that Olympic gold medal that he had been chasing for years, rolling on tennis courts all over the world, from 2008 to today.\n\nCries and bitter tears, transformed today into a liberating pain of joy. The GOAT has given another artwork to humanity, completing the much dreamed Career Golden Slam, winning everything that could be won on a tennis court, destroying any record. And he did it on the Philippe Chatrier, in a tournament where he first beat legendary rival Rafael Nadal and in the final Carlos Alcaraz, who had crushed him in the Wimbledon final. At 37 years old and with a knee operated on a month and a half ago, Djokovic achieved a new amazing milestone, by becoming the oldest tennis player to win an Olympic gold medal. Not only. The Serbian champion is the 5th tennis player in history to get the Career Golden Slam, after Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams.\n\nIn Beijing 2008 and London 2012 he surrendered in the semifinals to Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray respectively. In Rio de Janeiro 2016 he suffered one of the hardest defeats of his career against his friend Juan Martin del Potro. And when everything seemed done, he could not handle the pressure and suffered a sensational comeback from Alexander Zverev in Tokyo 2020. He accomplished the feat after an operation on the meniscus and on the surface he loves least compared to the others, almost as if he wanted to reaffirm his extraordinary nature with greater force.\n\nDjokovic has waited his whole life for this moment and won the only title that was still missing from his glorious collection. How will he find his motivation now, after this milestone? The 25th Major and the 8th Wimbledon are the last two records that he could still pursue. At 37 years old, after winning this coveted gold medal, finding motivation will not be easy: but only Djokovic can do it and win again. Novak Djokovic as a child can now look at himself in the mirror and notice something new, capable of emanating a golden glow.\n\nThe Serbian champion beat Alcaraz with the score of 7-6(3), 7-6(2). The first set was of an intensity and a level out of the ordinary, and both gave their all without holding back. Alcaraz saved himself with a perfect drop shot in the first game and then came back from 0-40 with quality on 1-2. In the fifth game, it was Djokovic's turn to do extraordinary things on serve and cancel three break points with three first serve winners. On 4-4, the Serbian literally went against fate, canceling all five opportunities offered to the Spaniard. Alcaraz performed equally well on the set point conceded just before the tie-break.\n\nThe tie-break rewarded Djokovic 7-3, who was good at finding a definitive return at 3-3. Thanks to the classic serve and forehand scheme, Alcaraz averted the dangers at the start of the second set. The Serbian tried with all his might to get the break, but the Spaniard proved impeccable in the games that ended in advantages with solutions that were as effective as they were spectacular. Another tie-break shifted the balance: definitively. Djokovic entered the legend with a stellar performance.

And that's the biggest battle to win.\n\n\"I'm super thrilled that I managed to do it here in the way that I did it, against a guy who is the best in the world at the moment. I'm just over the moon.\n\n\"Everything that I felt in that moment when I won really surpassed everything I thought or hoped that it would. I thought that carrying the flag at the opening ceremony (in London) was the best feeling ever until I experienced this today.\n\n\"And being on that court with the Serbian flag raising, singing the Serbian anthem, with the gold around my neck, I think nothing can beat that in terms of professional sport. It definitely stands out as the biggest sporting achievement I had.\"\n\nDjokovic's powers had appeared to be waning this season, with Alcaraz and fellow young gun Jannik Sinner taking charge, but he has not ruled out playing into his 40s and having another shot at the Olympics in 2028.\n\n\"I still want to play in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"I enjoy playing for my country and the Olympic Games particularly and Davis Cup, being part of the team.\"\n\nHe joins Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf as just the fifth player to complete the career Golden Slam of all four grand slam titles and Olympic singles gold.\n\nDjokovic still needs one more slam title to reach 25 and hold the all-time singles record, which could come at the US Open next month.\n\nOn whether he has 'completed' tennis, he added: \"Yes it's complete because I completed all the achievements with this gold medal but no because I love this sport. I don't play only to win the tournaments.\n\n\"I don't know about the future, I really want to be in the present moment to celebrate. It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal. So now it's about happiness, joy and celebration.\"\n\nThere was a remarkable intensity to the contest right from the start, with rallies of supreme quality and chances for both.\n\nAlcaraz recovered from 0-40 in the fourth game but then could not take any of eight break points, five of them at 4-4.\n\nDjokovic seized control in the tie-break, winning the last four points of a 93-minute set and ending it with his fist raised in the air. The second set was just as tight but again it was the Serbian who found something extra when it really mattered.\n\nAlcaraz broke down in tears during a TV interview on court but was able to reflect later with pride on taking silver on his Olympic debut.\n\n\"In front of me I had a really hungry Novak,\" said the 21-year-old, who has won each of his four slam finals.\n\n\"His level was really, really high. He didn't let me take the chances. I'm really proud and I'm leaving the court and leaving the tournament with my head really, really high, knowing that I gave everything that I could.\n\n\"This tournament has been really special for me, I'm going to take it for the rest of my life. Playing with Rafa (Nadal), having those feelings, getting my first Olympic medal - hopefully not the last one.\"\n\nBronze went to Lorenzo Musetti, and Italy were able to celebrate gold in the women's doubles, with Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini beating Russian duo Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider, who were playing as neutral athletes.", "source": {"uri": "kidderminstershuttle.co.uk", "dataType":

If it's ever going to be, it's going to be now.\n\n\"When I qualified for the finals, I felt a big relief because that's the hurdle I wasn't able to surpass. I did celebrate like I won the tournament. But of course I wanted gold and I knew that I would have to climb the highest mountain there is at the moment, playing Alcaraz.\"\n\nDjokovic saved eight break points during a match of stunning quality and intensity -- the Serb describing the duel as like few others he had ever experienced.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever played, maybe a few times in my life, such a high level for three hours for only two sets,\" he said. \"Credit to him, congratulations to him for a great tournament, great fighting spirit.\"\n\nReporting by Martyn Herman Editing by Toby Davis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martyn_herman@reuters.com", "name": "Martyn Herman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FE5NFNRFQZLCBGXYBJDJMWQ46I.jpg?auth=8950886b2934f97c5cd12086a1939adf93ac814ee45bdeda17a33d0d33581818&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The next likely challenger for that honor, Carlos Alcaraz, was Djokovic's opponent during Sunday's gold medal match at the Summer Olympics.\n\nAlcaraz had beaten Djokovic in each of the last two Wimbledon finals, and already has three legs of the career Grand Slam at age 21. The textbook definition of a prodigy, whose path to his only missing major, the Australian Open, figures to get easier whenever the 1o-time champ Djokovic retires. Just their mere playing against each other today was the stuff of legend.\n\nAbout the only accolade missing from Djokovic's trophy case was the Olympic gold. After a couple tense, tightly contested sets against Alcaraz and two tiebreakers, he can add that to his resume.\n\nAnd I gotta say, as somebody who hasn't been the biggest personal fan of Djoker throughout his career, I was kind of blown away by his reaction to winning.\n\nFor as much of that as he's done in his incredible career, this meant something more. Representing his home country of Serbia. The baggage of falling short in the Summer Olympics time and again. All to finally break through at 37 years old against somebody who denied him a potential eighth and ninth championship at Wimbledon. Once he blasted a forehand winner on match point, everything came pouring out of Djokovic as he celebrated his triumph.\n\nThe picture below might be the lasting image of Djokovic's Olympic victory. It serves as a reminder that all-time great athletes are people, too, which can be very easy to lose sight of especially these days.\n\nOn the flip side, Alcaraz was understandably heartbroken, hoping to match his Spanish compatriot and doubles partner Rafael Nadal with a singles gold. Rafa topped the podium at the 2008 Beijing Summer Games, and partnered with Alcaraz to reach the doubles quarterfinals in Paris.\n\nAlcaraz will have at least a couple more opportunities, maybe as many as four more, to get that gold. It's just really cool to see how much the Olympics mean to the biggest stars in tennis. Not sure it's necessarily reached \"fifth major\" status in men's golf just yet, but it sure feels that way in this particular sport.\n\nCongrats to Novak Djokovic. Retirement speculation will persist, but let's just soak in the moment. Plus, if I were him, I wouldn't want to follow Andy Murray's epic bow-out anyway.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Joker-1.jpg?fit=967%2C539&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

To fight the way they did across two stirring sets and play at the lofty level they did with so much on the line was astounding. They have never played a match remotely like it.\n\nThis was their seventh meeting and they have had some astounding showdowns. The five set Wimbledon final that Carlos won last year was a beauty, and their four hour epic in Cincinnati when Novak came from match point down in the second set tie-break to win in a third set breaker was another gem. But the standard from beginning to end in this Olympic duel was nothing short of stupendous. Neither man broke serve in the match, although Carlos had eight break points and Novak had six.\n\nBut fittingly it all came down to Djokovic prevailing in a pair of tie-breaks. He is the game's greatest tie-break performer ever, and his ability to produce his best under pressure was fully on display in these two sequences. In the first set tie-break, the score was tied at 3-3 but Djokovic swept four points in a row, starting that run with a beautifully angled forehand return winner and ending it with a forehand drop volley winner. The second set tie-break pattern was similar. In that one it was 2-2 and Djokovic took five points in a row to close out an incredibly hard fought 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) victory.\n\nThis was the one missing link from the Djokovic glittering resume. He already had his men's record of 24 majors, but, having never even made the final in four previous appearances at the Olympic Games, this was one of the most important matches of his career. Alcaraz, too., was eager to keep winning when it counted. He had won the last two Grand Slam events, taking the first on the same court at Roland Garros, winning over Djokovic for the second year in a row at Wimbledon. These two men were magnificent on the red clay at Roland Garros. Alcaraz was his usual spectacular self with his wide range of talent, his explosiveness and his incomparable drop shots. Djokovic was his typical sturdy self with unrelenting depth off both sides and the willingness to attack when it mattered. But, above all else, he had one of his great serving days, winning 78% of his first serve points in the match and earning free points with regularity.\n\nAlcaraz gave a first rate performance in defeat and Djokovic played his match of the year to win. It was also one of the finest performances of Djokovic's career.

one for Djokovic that Alcaraz beat away - and the Serbian's mental fortitude was on full display in the crunch tie-breaker.\n\nAfter building up a seemingly unassailable 6-2 lead, Djokovic powered a ferocious forehand into the corner beyond Alcaraz's reach, his 15th winner of the day and one that completed the Serbian's glittering set.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Table tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ATP_Tour_top-level_tournament_singles_champions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of ATP Tour top-level tournament singles champions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/31/novak-djokovic_1.JPG?w=300&h=225&auto=compress,format&fit=clip", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

It was an emotional and well-deserved triumph for arguably the greatest male player in history.\n\nLorenzo Musetti: Musetti extended a stunning season for Italian tennis by becoming their first-ever tennis medallist after taking bronze. It also continued a summer resurgence for him - watch out for the 22-year-old throughout the rest of the season.\n\nTommy Paul: US star Paul lost in the last eight - but that was by far the toughest test Alcaraz faced on his way to the final. The American continues to impress this year and has made himself one of the toughest players to beat.\n\nFelix Auger-Aliassime: Fourth is a tough place for the Canadian to finish, but he did get a mixed doubles bronze medal - and eye-catching wins over Medvedev and Ruud must give him confidence.\n\nOlympic Games News\n\nCarlos Alcaraz reveals what Novak Djokovic told him at the net as he vows 'to be better than Djokovic'\n\nThe 5 players to complete a career Golden Slam as Novak Djokovic joins Rafael Nadal on list\n\nCasper Ruud: Twice a finalist at Roland Garros and back in form this year, expectations were fairly high for Ruud. A quarter-final exit on his favourite surface felt like a missed opportunity.\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas: Tsitsipas had Djokovic in the ropes in the second set of their quarter-final but, rather predictably, failed to take advantage - and has lost 12 straight to the Serbian. He looks far away from contending for the biggest titles in the sport.\n\nAlexander Zverev: Having won in Tokyo three years ago, Zverev will always be an Olympic champion. But, it felt like he had a real chance to win a second gold after the form he's been in this year, and a quarter-final loss to Musetti came as a huge surprise.\n\nDaniil Medvedev: Medvedev has not won a title since Rome last year, and a surprise defeat to Auger-Aliassime in round three meant early exits in all three formats for him. Something is not quite clicking for him at the moment.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz: Alcaraz left with a silver medal, but we all know he wanted gold - and emotions were evidently high after a tough defeat in the final. He certainly has time to win gold at one point, but Djokovic's journey shows how tough that can be.\n\nRead Next: Paris 2024 women's singles winners & losers: Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff fall flat as Zheng Qinwen & Donna Vekic star", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oli_dickson_jefford@tennis365.com", "name": "Oli Dickson Jefford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Paul_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Paul (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Qinwen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zheng Qinwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Veki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donna Veki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Tsitsipas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefanos Tsitsipas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F08%2F05103032%2FDjokovic-Alcaraz-Musetti.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The Spanish champion had to give way to a great Novak Djokovic, who showed his best performance of the season right at the decisive moment of the Olympic tournament.\n\nCarlitos didn't play a perfect match like at Wimbledon, but he did express an excellent tennis and would have beaten almost all the other players of the tour. The former world number 1 has given up in two tiebreaks without ever losing his serve, a further testament to the quality of the match that was played yesterday on the iconic Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThe four-time Grand Slam champion was very sad at the end of the match and burst into tears at the microphones of Alex Corretja, But he confessed that he felt proud and that he will try again to win the gold medal in Los Angeles in four years. Despite yesterday's defeat, the level of Spanish in the last month and a half has been really impressive. The 21-year-old from Murcia has won the French Open and Wimbledon Championships and is one step away from winning the gold medal in Paris, an incredible result for a player of his age.\n\nAlcaraz will not be in Montreal this week, but he is expected to play the Cincinnati Masters 1000 before the US Open. The match between Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic at the Paris Olympics was the best of this year. The young Spaniard had several chances in the first set, but Nole was very good at raising the level in the decisive moments and to cancel five break points in the ninth game.\n\nSpeaking with 'El Partidazo de COPE' after the Olympic final, Juan Carlos Ferrero opened up on Carlitos' performance: \"Sport is like that, there are painful defeats, but those are the ones that make players grow the most. Novak has played amazing, making few mistakes, raising his level in important moments. I think Carlos Alcaraz has not managed the emotions as well as in the Grand Slam finals, but everything is learned.\"\n\nDespite the painful defeat, Alcaraz must be proud of his 'journey' and how much he fought for the love of his country. \"It was a different type of pressure,\" Alcaraz said during the press conference. \"Everyone in Spain wanted me to win the gold, and I wanted to win the gold as well. In those difficult moments I usually raise my level, but I wasn't able to do that today. Probably I felt the pressure in those situations.\n\nYou play four Grand Slams every year, the Olympics is only once every four years. Obviously this week, this tournament has been really special for me. I'm going to take it for the rest of my life, for the rest of my career, for sure. Playing with Rafa, getting my first Olympics medal -- hopefully not the last one -- it's been a special one. In the close moments, in the difficult situations, in the tiebreakers, he played an impressive game. He was hungry for the gold medal. He was going to go for it.\"\n\nThe former world number 1 gave his best throughout the tournament and proved once again to be a true champion. Alcaraz is the future of tennis and aims to become one of the best ever. During the press conference, the 4-time Grand Slam champion revealed what Djokovic told him at the end of the match: \"He is enjoying his moment and I couldn't exchange many words. At the net he told me that I will win gold one day and I'm going to work for it.\n\nMy moment will come. He deserves to live this moment with his family. His tears indicate that he was really looking forward to it. It reminds me more of the one I lost in Cincinnati, where I had my chances and it was a great battle. All the matches against him are great battles and it is a spectacle for more people to watch tennis. These matches make you a better player and a better person.

Djokovic won in two sets, both decided by tiebreakers. Louise Delmotte/Associated Press\n\nPARIS -- For all of his Grand Slam championships and other titles, for all of his time at No. 1, Novak Djokovic really, really wanted an Olympic gold medal for Serbia - the only significant accomplishment missing from his glittering resume.\n\nHe finally got one at age 37. Doesn't matter a bit how long it took. Djokovic beat Spain's Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in an enthralling and evenly matched men's tennis singles final at the 2024 Games on Sunday.\n\n\"I put my heart, my soul, my body, my family - my everything - on the line to win Olympic gold,\" Djokovic said. \"Incredible battle. Incredible fight.\"\n\nHis impressive career already featured a men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies and the most weeks spent atop in the rankings by any man or woman. It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze - and he made it clear that simply wasn't sufficient.\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nBefore facing Musetti, Djokovic said, \"I was like, 'OK, let's get through this one.' That's why today, before the match, I did not feel as nervous as I would normally feel, because I had secured a medal.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets. Now Djokovic is the oldest man to win the singles gold in his sport since 1908, and he prevented Alcaraz, who is 21, from becoming the youngest.\n\n\"In the tough moments, he gave it an extra push,\" silver medalist Alcaraz said through his own tears. \"It hurts to lose like this.\"\n\nThe final, which lasted 2 hours, 50 minutes despite being decided in only two sets, was a rematch of the Wimbledon title match three weeks ago that Alcaraz won to follow up his French Open title in June.\n\nAlcaraz also defeated Djokovic in last year's Wimbledon final, but Djokovic won when they met in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open, the annual clay-court tournament held at Roland Garros, the site used for tennis during these Olympics.\n\nGYMNASTICS: Kaylia Nemour of Algeria delivered the country's first Olympic gold medal in gymnastics, putting together a thrilling routine in the uneven bars final to edge Qiu Qiyuan of China.\n\nSunisa Lee of the U.S. picked up her third medal in Paris and sixth of her Olympic career by grabbing bronze, exactly where she finished in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCYCLING: Kristen Faulkner, a former rower at Harvard who only made the Olympic team as a replacement, was a surprise winner in the women's road race, becoming the first American rider in 40 years to win a medal in the event.\n\nShe timed her attack to perfection against vastly more experienced riders. Among them was Dutch rider Marianne Vos, one of the greatest female cyclists of all time.\n\n\"It's a dream come true,\" Faulkner said. \"It's the best feeling in the world. I don't know how to describe it.\"\n\nFaulkner finished the 98-mile race 58 seconds clear of Vos, Lotte Kopecky of Belgium and Blanka Vas of Hungary, who were separated by a photo finish, with Vos taking silver and Kopecky getting the bronze.\n\nARCHERY: Brady Ellison of the U.S. was edged by South Korea's Kim Woo-jin in a shoot-off as he settled for another silver medal in the men's individual final.\n\nEllison, competing in his fifth Olympics, and Kim Woo-jin battled to a draw through four sets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth scored 10 points on their single arrow in the shoot-off, but Kim's was closer to the center, giving him his third gold medal of the Paris Games.\n\nEllison claimed his second medal of the Games, following a bronze he won with Casey Kaufhold in the mixed team event on Friday. He extended his U.S. career record to five Olympic medals; three silvers and two bronzes.\n\n3\u00d73 BASKETBALL: The U.S. men's team was eliminated after a 21-6 loss to the Netherlands, finishing 2-5 in pool play while playing its last five games without star Jimmer Fredette.\n\nFredette was brought in to boost the team after it failed to qualify for the Tokyo Games, and his play helped the U.S. enter these Olympics as the No. 2 seed. But he sustained a lower extremity injury in the team's second game and didn't play again.\n\nTRIATHLON: Belgium's Olympic committee announced that it would withdraw its team from the mixed relay triathlon after one of its competitors who swam in the Seine River last week fell ill.\n\nClaire Michel, who competed in the women's triathlon Wednesday, \"is unfortunately ill and will have to withdraw from the competition,\" the Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee said in a statement.\n\nParis 2024 organizers had no immediate statement.\n\nThe mixed relay triathlon is scheduled to take place Monday. Belgium's statement did not elaborate on Michel's illness, but it comes after concerns over the river's water quality.\n\nSwiss officials said Saturday that triathlete Adrien Briffod, who also raced Wednesday, fell ill with a stomach infection. But they said it was \"impossible to say\" whether it was linked to swimming in the Seine, and reported that other delegations told them none of their triathletes had reported stomach problems.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press

Djokovic, who has long spoken of winning Olympic gold for his country as one of his most sought-after goals, was visibly emotional after overcoming Carlos Alcaraz in a gripping encounter in Paris.\n\n\"I'm overwhelmed with everything that I'm feeling right now,\" said Djokovic in post-match comments to NBC. \"Millions of different emotions of course: positive, too proud, too happy. The possibility to fight for a gold and to win a gold for the first time in my career for my country is arguably the biggest success I ever had.\n\n\"Of course, I want everything there is to win in my individual career, but winning Davis Cup and particularly the golden medal at an Olympic Games for Serbia at the age of thirty-seven is unprecedented. Just starting my celebration, I can't wait for what's coming up in the next forty-eight hours.\"\n\nLong acknowledged as one of the greatest athletes the world has ever seen, Djokovic added an Olympic gold medal to his record 24 major singles titles by overcoming Alcaraz in a pair of tie-breaks. The Serbian is the fifth player to complete the Career Golden Slam by winning all four Grand Slam events and Olympic gold in singles, after Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams.\n\n\"Yes, [my] puzzle, it is [complete],\" acknowledged Djokovic, who has spent more weeks as No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings than any other player (428). \"I'm telling myself always that I am enough, because I can be very self-critical. It's probably one of the biggest internal battles that I keep on fighting with myself, that I don't feel like I've done enough. That I haven't been enough in my life, on the court and off the court, so it's a big lesson for me.\n\n\"I'm super grateful for the blessing to win a historic gold medal for my country, to complete the Golden Slam, to complete all the records.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Golden_Globe_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Golden Globe Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/08/04/15/25/djokovic-olympics-match-point.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

wins Olympic gold to complete career Golden Slam", "body": "Novak Djokovic defeated Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday to claim a maiden Olympic title and become just the fifth player to complete a career Golden Slam.\n\nThe 37-year-old Serb, competing in his fifth Games, came through 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) in an enthralling final at Roland Garros to add Olympic gold to his 24 Grand Slam triumphs.\n\nVictory allowed him to join Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Steffi Graf and the watching Serena Williams as the only players to win all four Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic singles gold.\n\nHe also became the oldest singles champion since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988 and shattered Alcaraz's bid to add gold to the French Open and Wimbledon titles he has already pocketed this summer.\n\nAn emotional Djokovic celebrated by holding aloft the Serbian flag on court before clambering into the players' box to embrace his wife and children.\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" said Djokovic, who had lost heavily to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final last month.\n\n- 'Finally I did it' -\n\n\"I put my body, my family on the line to win gold and finally I did it.\"\n\nAlcaraz was distraught and wept as he attempted to conduct a TV interview.\n\n\"Three hours, a big battle with tough moments,\" said the 21-year-old after a final in which neither player dropped serve. \"It's very painful to lose.\"\n\nDjokovic carved out a break point in the second game of the opener and three more in the fourth, all saved by the Spaniard.\n\nThen it was the Serb's turn to demonstrate his famed powers of resilience, fighting off three break points in the fifth game and another five in a marathon ninth game.\n\nIn a rollercoaster duel, Alcaraz saved a set point in the 12th game but his veteran opponent dominated the tiebreak to claim the opener after a breathless 93 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThere was no let-up in the second set, scintillating shot-making alongside rousing defence with Alcaraz fighting off the final's 14th break point in the third game.\n\nAgain the set was decided by a tie-break and it was Djokovic with history on the line again sweeping through to take victory after two hours and 50 minutes.\n\nLorenzo Musetti defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets on Saturday to claim the bronze medal, giving Italy its first men's tennis medal in 100 years.\n\nLater Sunday, Russian athletes can claim their first gold of the Games when Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider face the Italian team of Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini in the women's doubles.\n\nRussian competitors are taking part in the Olympics as neutrals following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022.\n\nIf Andreeva and Shnaider win gold, their achievement will not be recognised in the medals table while both the Russian flag and national anthem will be banned from the podium ceremony.\n\nCristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo, the Spanish eighth seeds, defeated the Czech pair of Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-2 in the bronze medal match.\n\ndj/jw",

And, after 2hr 50min, it was hard not to feel sympathy for the loser, if he can called be such, for Alcaraz was a hero no matter that his silver medal was of little immediate consolation.\n\nThe 21-year-old cried, too, but for more painful reasons than his vanquisher, though his chance should come again.\n\nYou couldn't promise that of Novak. He is 37 now and will be 41 in Los Angeles in 2028. His realisation of a finite deadline no doubt went into the manner of his celebrations.\n\nAfter he picked himself off the clay, he sat in his chair and wept before taking the Serbian flag he had been handed. He climbed into the stands of Court Philippe-Chatrier to hug his wife, Jelena, and daughter, Tara, six.\n\nThe Serbian couldn't take the smile off his face as he headed to his celebration party at Siena restaurant in the French capital following his victory against Spanish player Carlos Alcaraz\n\nNovak, who donned a brown polo top, tan trousers and white trainers for the occasion, was seen inside the restaurant surrounded by pals\n\nThe star's gold medal with blue ribbon was clear for all to see\n\nSnowfall star Damson Idris was in attendance at the celebratory party\n\nBasketball star Jayson Tatum donned a White T-shirt for the night out\n\nHe was earlier seen being cheered on by a horde of fans as he made his way inside while clutching the Serbian flag\n\nRead More Novak Djokovic is left in TEARS after finally sealing 'historic' career golden slam with Olympic win\n\nTara may not be able to absorb the full extent of her father's accomplishment yet, but she can be proud that he stands as one of only five greats to have pulled off the career 'Golden Slam' of Wimbledon and the French, US and Australian Opens - and Olympic gold.\n\nSteffi Graf, in 1998, Andre Agassi, completed in 1999, Rafael Nadal, in 2010, and Serena Williams, in 2012, are the others.\n\n'Three out of four Olympic Games, I lost in the semi-finals. I won a bronze medal in Beijing. I carried the flag for Serbia in 2012, in London, which was one of the best feelings I ever had in my life.\n\n'I didn't know until today that there's even a better feeling - winning a gold for your country.\n\n'This supersedes everything that I've ever felt on the tennis court. It's incredible joy.'\n\nNovak sunk to his knees after winning the men's singles gold medal match on Sunday\n\nDjokovic was emotional as he held up a Serbian flag after ending his long wait for Olympic gold\n\nNew Olympic champion Djokovic pictured hugging Carlos Alcaraz after beating him 7-6 7-6\n\nSerena Williams, who has four Olympic gold medals, was among the crowd for Sunday's final\n\nRemarkably, Djokovic triumphed despite damaging his meniscus during the French Open in June. He wore strapping on his right knee throughout the Olympic tournament.\n\nBut rather than having a full surgical repair, which involves stitching the damaged area back together, followed by weeks in a knee brace, he had the area filed down with a 'duckbill punch' tool.\n\nHe needed treatment for a flare-up here in his quarter-final win over Stefanos Tsitsipas. A lover of setting new records, nothing would easily have stopped him. Anyway, he is now moving far more easily than in the Wimbledon final when Alcaraz made light work of him.\n\nDjokovic was in tears moments after his victory at Roland Garros in Paris on Sunday afternoon\n\nShortly after the match, Djokovic climbed into the crowd and made a beeline for his family\n\nDjokovic pictured kissing wife Jelena after he completed a career Golden Slam on Sunday\n\nA grinning Djokovic pictured standing on top of an Olympic podium, flanked by runner-up Alcarez (left) and Lorenzo Musetti (right) - who won the bronze medal for Italy\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nOn Sunday, it was gruelling for them both. Neither broke the other's serve once, despite break points galore. It was that tight.\n\nWith his inventiveness, youthfulness and manoeuvrability, Alcaraz was brilliant, no lost cause beyond his athleticism. As for his forehand it flew as fast and effectively as an Exocet. Has there ever been a more deadly weapon in tennis? And then there are his dextrous drops shots to contend with.\n\nAh, and then you come up against Djokovic. He was like a wall, and you could only marvel at his resilience and courtcraft. As little Tara's sign declared: 'Dad's the best.'\n\nHe's certainly the flintiest, and that may amount to pretty much the same thing.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

After cruising through the opening game, Djokovic took the young Spaniard to deuce in the second game. After a near five-minute fight for the point, the Spaniard finally held his serve.\n\nThe reality of Alcaraz's early game was equal parts sheer brilliance, with a series of effortless drop shots and precise winners, and frustrating errors, committing numerous unforced errors to give Djokovic free points.\n\nOn the other hand, Djokovic was relentless, machine-like, taking Alcaraz to deuce again in the fourth game before Alcaraz was once again forced to fight to hold his serve.\n\nYet, in the fifth game, it was Alcaraz's turn to take Djokovic into deuce on his serve as both men refused to give an inch. The battle between the relentless Djokovic and Alcaraz's pure talent and scrappiness was evident.\n\nIn the ninth game, Alcaraz missed five separate break points before Djokovic had to show some Alcaraz-like aggressiveness to secure his serve after an incredible 18 points in the game.\n\nNow the match had become a breathless fight over every point as each man looked to dominate from the baseline and at the net.\n\nDespite half chances and minor opportunities, neither was able to find the gap in the other's defense as the first set went to a tiebreak, which Djokovic won 7-3.\n\nMatching each other early in the tiebreak, Djokovic pulled away after Alcaraz hit three unforced errors before the Serb pounced on the set point to drop the ball out of Alcaraz's reach.\n\nThe fight continued in the second set with an unrelenting battle over each point. The third game once again saw Alcaraz fight from break point to save his serve, but both men maintained their service games and nullified the other's attacks.\n\nAs the level of tennis continued to rise, so did the volume inside Court Philippe-Chatrier as fans roared on their men.\n\nEqual to each other, the second set once again went to a tiebreak, with the gold medal on the line for Djokovic and a third set decider for Alcaraz. The tiebreak opened in Djokovic's favor with a threaded diagonal forehand winner as the bar continued to be set higher and higher. Another, even tighter forehand winner for the fifth point shifted the momentum straight in his favor.\n\nAfter another forehand winner down the line, a couple of Alcaraz unforced errors, and one final forehand ground stroke winner, Djokovic won his first Olympic gold.\n\nFollowing the win, Djokovic climbed into the crowd to hug his family and team before a wave of emotion crashed over him. The win represents Serbia's second gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nThe final day of tennis action also saw the medals for the women's doubles decided.\n\nIn the last match of the tournament, the women's doubles pair of Errani and Paolini came from behind to win gold, Italy's second medal following the bronze in the men's singles.\n\nAfter a slow start, the Italian pair steadily picked up their form and improved throughout the match, outlasting Andreeva and Shnaider in the third set tiebreak.", "source": {"uri": "dailyfinland.fi", "dataType": "news", "title": "clickittefaq"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Shnaider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana Shnaider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Errani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sara Errani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2024/08/05/image-38885-1722807926.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

I don't play only to win the tournaments.\n\n\"I don't know about the future, I really want to be in the present moment to celebrate. It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal. So now it's about happiness, joy and celebration.\"\n\nThere was a remarkable intensity to the contest right from the start, with rallies of supreme quality and chances for both.\n\nAlcaraz recovered from 0-40 in the fourth game but then could not take any of eight break points, five of them at 4-4.\n\nAlcaraz broke down in tears during a TV interview on court but was able to reflect later with pride on taking silver on his Olympic debut.\n\n\"In front of me I had a really hungry Novak,\" said the 21-year-old, who has won each of his four slam finals.\n\n\"His level was really, really high. He didn't let me take the chances. I'm really proud and I'm leaving the court and leaving the tournament with my head really, really high, knowing that I gave everything that I could.\n\n\"This tournament has been really special for me, I'm going to take it for the rest of my life.

The elusive trophy had been claimed. At 37-years-old, he was the Olympic champion in the men's singles tennis competition. The triumph for himself and Serbia came 16 years after winning bronze at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nDjokovic claimed the prize with an intense 7-6, 7-6 victory over Spain's Carlos Alcaraz, the man who beat him in straight sets on 14 July to win the Wimbledon title for a second time at his expense.\n\nBut that was on grass in south-west London. On Court Philippe Chatrier at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, Djokovic had the psychological advantage of a success last year in the semi-final of the French Open.\n\nBilled as a clash of generations, that match fizzled out into a Djokovic stroll as the then 20-year-old Alcaraz suffered with cramps due to the pressure of entering a tournament as world number one and playing a crunch tie against legend of the sport.\n\nAlcaraz vowed to learn from his four-set defeat. Two Wimbledon titles and a French Open crown suggest an upward curve.\n\nFourteen months on from that French Open meeting, Djokovic and Alcaraz engaged in the gladitoral combat predicted for that sultry afternoon in June 2023.\n\nThe augurs came early. It took them 25 minutes to reach 2-2 in the first set.\n\nJust over an hour later, they were in a tiebreak after Alcaraz saved a set point on his way to levelling at 6-6.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/rfi_english_75/d041a52d0993ea10fc078bd7e40e28d1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 408, "textEnd": 415}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

It also already contained a Summer Olympics bronze medal from 2008 -- but he has made clear that simply was not sufficient.\n\nThe final in Paris, which lasted 2 hours, 50 minutes, was a rematch of the Wimbledon title match three weeks ago that Alcaraz, 21, won to follow up his French Open title in June.\n\nAlcaraz also defeated Djokovic in last year's final at the All England Club, but Djokovic won when they met in the semi-finals of the 2023 French Open.\n\nSunday's contest was an enthralling matchup. Most remarkable, was how cleanly both men played, despite the talent of the opposition and pressure of the occasion. Unforced errors were rare.\n\nThe only shame, perhaps, for the fans -- and, naturally, the loser -- was that the Olympics uses a best-of-three-set format, instead of the best-of-five at Grand Slam tournaments. Make no mistake, this encounter between the No. 1-seeded Djokovic and No. 2-seeded Alcaraz was worthy of a major final, and no one fortunate enough to hold a ticket could complain about not getting their money's worth.\n\nThose in the stands became part of the show, repeatedly breaking out into choruses of \"No-le! No-le!\" or \"Car-los! Car-los!\" that often overlapped, creating an operatic fugue. In the second set, as Alcaraz attempted to mount a comeback, his supporters began chanting, \"Si, se puede!\" (essentially, \"Yes, you can!\") while shaking their red-and-yellow flags.\n\nBoth men played to the crowd. When Alcaraz raced to reach one drop shot and deposit it over the net for a winner, he basked in the raucous reaction by pointing his right index finger to his ear. When Djokovic laced a cross-court forehand winner on the run to cap a 10-shot point to lead 3-2 in the second tiebreaker, he waved both arms overhead to encourage folks who already were on their feet, screaming.\n\nAfter winning, Djokovic turned toward his team in the stands -- sitting in front of his wife and their two children -- and dropped his racket as he knelt on the clay.

After cruising through the opening game, Djokovic took the young Spaniard to deuce in the second game. After a near five-minute fight for the point, the Spaniard finally held his serve.\n\nThe reality of Alcaraz's early game was equal parts sheer brilliance, with a series of effortless drop shots and precise winners, and frustrating errors, committing numerous unforced errors to give Djokovic free points.\n\nOn the other hand, Djokovic was relentless, machine-like, taking Alcaraz to deuce again in the fourth game before Alcaraz was once again forced to fight to hold his serve.\n\nYet, in the fifth game, it was Alcaraz's turn to take Djokovic into deuce on his serve as both men refused to give an inch. The battle between the relentless Djokovic and Alcaraz's pure talent and scrappiness was evident.\n\nIn the ninth game, Alcaraz missed five separate break points before Djokovic had to show some Alcaraz-like aggressiveness to secure his serve after an incredible 18 points in the game.\n\nNow the match had become a breathless fight over every point as each man looked to dominate from the baseline and at the net.\n\nDespite half chances and minor opportunities, neither was able to find the gap in the other's defense as the first set went to a tiebreak, which Djokovic won 7-3.\n\nMatching each other early in the tiebreak, Djokovic pulled away after Alcaraz hit three unforced errors before the Serb pounced on the set point to drop the ball out of Alcaraz's reach.\n\nThe fight continued in the second set with an unrelenting battle over each point. The third game once again saw Alcaraz fight from break point to save his serve, but both men maintained their service games and nullified the other's attacks.\n\nAs the level of tennis continued to rise, so did the volume inside Court Philippe-Chatrier as fans roared on their men.\n\nEqual to each other, the second set once again went to a tiebreak, with the gold medal on the line for Djokovic and a third set decider for Alcaraz. The tiebreak opened in Djokovic's favor with a threaded diagonal forehand winner as the bar continued to be set higher and higher. Another, even tighter forehand winner for the fifth point shifted the momentum straight in his favor.\n\nAfter another forehand winner down the line, a couple of Alcaraz unforced errors, and one final forehand ground stroke winner, Djokovic won his first Olympic gold.\n\nFollowing the win, Djokovic climbed into the crowd to hug his family and team before a wave of emotion crashed over him. The win represents Serbia's second gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nThe final day of tennis action also saw the medals for the women's doubles decided.\n\nIn the last match of the tournament, the women's doubles pair of Errani and Paolini came from behind to win gold, Italy's second medal following the bronze in the men's singles.\n\nAfter a slow start, the Italian pair steadily picked up their form and improved throughout the match, outlasting Andreeva and Shnaider in the third set tiebreak.\n\nSpain's Cristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo claimed bronze in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, against Czechia's Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Shnaider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana Shnaider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Errani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sara Errani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Noskov\u00e1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linda Noskov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Buc\u0219a", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristina Buc\u0219a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol\u00edna_Muchov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Sorribes_Tormo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sara Sorribes Tormo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

And that's the biggest battle to win.\n\n\"I'm super thrilled that I managed to do it here in the way that I did it, against a guy who is the best in the world at the moment. I'm just over the moon.\n\n\"Everything that I felt in that moment when I won really surpassed everything I thought or hoped that it would. I thought that carrying the flag at the opening ceremony (in London) was the best feeling ever until I experienced this today.\n\n\"And being on that court with the Serbian flag raising, singing the Serbian anthem, with the gold around my neck, I think nothing can beat that in terms of professional sport. It definitely stands out as the biggest sporting achievement I had.\"\n\nDjokovic's powers had appeared to be waning this season, with Alcaraz and fellow young gun Jannik Sinner taking charge, but he has not ruled out playing into his 40s and having another shot at the Olympics in 2028.\n\n\"I still want to play in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"I enjoy playing for my country and the Olympic Games particularly and Davis Cup, being part of the team.\"\n\nHe joins Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf as just the fifth player to complete the career Golden Slam of all four grand slam titles and Olympic singles gold.\n\nDjokovic still needs one more slam title to reach 25 and hold the all-time singles record, which could come at the US Open next month.\n\nOn whether he has 'completed' tennis, he added: \"Yes it's complete because I completed all the achievements with this gold medal but no because I love this sport. I don't play only to win the tournaments.\n\n\"I don't know about the future, I really want to be in the present moment to celebrate. It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal. So now it's about happiness, joy and celebration.\"\n\nThere was a remarkable intensity to the contest right from the start, with rallies of supreme quality and chances for both.\n\nAlcaraz recovered from 0-40 in the fourth game but then could not take any of eight break points, five of them at 4-4.\n\nAlcaraz broke down in tears during a TV interview on court but was able to reflect later with pride on taking silver on his Olympic debut.\n\n\"In front of me I had a really hungry Novak,\" said the 21-year-old, who has won each of his four slam finals.\n\n\"His level was really, really high. He didn't let me take the chances. I'm really proud and I'm leaving the court and leaving the tournament with my head really, really high, knowing that I gave everything that I could.\n\n\"This tournament has been really special for me, I'm going to take it for the rest of my life. Playing with Rafa (Nadal), having those feelings, getting my first Olympic medal - hopefully not the last one.\"\n\nBronze went to Lorenzo Musetti, and Italy were able to celebrate gold in the women's doubles, with Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini beating Russian duo Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider, who were playing as neutral athletes.", "source": {"uri": "somersetcountygazette.co.uk",

She's the first American to medal twice on bars in Olympic history.\n\nOn the track, Noah Lyles will look to earn a medal in the men's 100-meter final. But first he must advance past the semifinals. Lyles admitted he underestimated the field in his preliminary round run on Saturday, finishing second in the race.\n\nSunday marks the last day of the swimming events at the Paris Games with three finals. Team USA's Gretchen Walsh can win her fourth medal of Paris in the women's 50-meter freestyle, while American swimmer Kate Douglass looks for the same total as she competes in the women's 4x100-meter medley relay.\n\nAlso headlining Sunday's events was the men's singles gold medal match in Tennis. In a rematch of the Wimbledon 2024 final, Novak Djokovic dispatched Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros to give Djokovic, of Serbia, his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nScott Scheffler shot a course record-tying 62 to come from behind to win gold.\n\n11:26 a.m. ET -- Djokovic wins the one title missing from his resume ... Olympic gold\n\nNovak Djokovic is an Olympic gold medalist at last.\n\nAfter a career filled with history-making accomplishments and 24 major titles, the 37-year-old finally achieved the lone achievement that has eluded him in four previous Olympic appearances.\n\nAnd he did it with a statement-making win over Carlos Alcaraz, his young rival who defeated him in the Wimbledon final just three weeks ago. Needing tiebreaks in both sets, Djokovic ultimately got the job done, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in an epic battle full of electrifying rallies and highlight reel-worthy points.\n\nIt has been a tough season for Djokovic -- he hadn't won a title all year entering the Olympics, marking his worst start of a season since 2006 -- and he underwent knee surgery in June. He was understandably emotional at the match's conclusion on Sunday.\n\nWhen it was over he immediately crouched in near-disbelief, and then seconds later, after exchanging a warm hug with Alcaraz, he went back out onto the court and fell to his knees. He leaned over and remained there as the crowd -- even those who had been waving Spanish flags -- gave him a standing ovation.\n\nDjokovic then sobbed in his chair before running over to his family with a Serbian flag. He hugged his children while still crying.\n\nAfter advancing to Sunday's final -- already resulting in his best result at the Olympics -- Djokovic said he was ecstatic to know he was bringing home a medal.\n\n\"Just to secure a higher medal for the first time for my country, whatever happens on Sunday, [there's] huge pride, honor and happiness,\" Djokovic said. \"It's why I celebrated [on court] the way I did, and I still feel like I need to celebrate that because it's a big success.\"\n\nDjokovic now joins Serena Williams, who was in attendance for part of the match, as the only Olympic singles champions to not drop a set en route to the gold.\n\nThe silver marked the 21-year-old Alcaraz's first Olympic medal. Italy's Lorenzo Musetti earned the bronze medal on Friday with a three-set win over Canada's Felix Auger Aliassime.\n\n10:35 a.m. ET -- Suni Lee wins bronze, Kaylia Nemour makes history for Algeria\n\nThree days after earning her second Olympic all-around medal, Suni Lee earned her second bronze in uneven bars. She now holds six Olympic medals, with one more opportunity in Monday's balance beam final.\n\nLee was the last gymnast to compete in the uneven bars final and needed to score higher than 14.766 to bump Belgium's Nina Derwael, the reigning Olympic champ, off the podium. Lee qualified third into the final with a 14.866 and earned an identical score during Thursday's all-around. Just like in that meet, she mounted the bars knowing a medal was within her grasp.\n\nHer performance was nearly flawless until she took one step on her landing. The crowd erupted when her score appeared. She didn't match her qualifying score, but her 14.8 was once again good enough for bronze.\n\nAlgeria's Kaylia Nemour, 17, the reigning world silver medalist on uneven bars, won Africa's first ever Olympic medal in gymnastics. She scored a massive 15.7, earned by combining a 7.2 difficulty score with excellent execution. Born and raised in France, Nemour competed for France until 2022, and this crowd reacted with no less pride when she stuck her double-layout dismount than for every French gymnast who's competed here in Paris.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Qiu Qiyuan of China hit a flawless routine with gorgeous lines and time-stopping handstands and nailed her landing. She matched Nemour's incredible difficulty score but earned two-tenths lower in execution for a 15.5 and bronze.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, China's Yang Liu won gold in the rings, followed by his teammate, Jingyuan Zou, who earned silver. Greece's Eleftherios Petrounias took bronze.\n\nFrance's Samir Ait Said dismounted to a Biles-like response from this majority French crowd. His score placed him just off the medals podium in fourth place and let's just say the crowd did not agree with the judging panel. -- Alyssa Roenigk\n\n9:58 a.m. ET -- Djokovic inches closer to golden glory\n\nJust one set stands between Novak Djokovic and his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe Olympic title has been perhaps the only thing in the sport Djokovic, the 24-time major champion, has yet to win and he's been open about just how much it would mean to him. On Sunday, facing Carlos Alcaraz, his young nemesis, Djokovic was pushed to the brink but ultimately held off the 21-year-old Spaniard in a tiebreak, 7-6 (3), to take the opening set.\n\nIt's so far been a far more compelling match than their lopsided clash in the Wimbledon final just three weeks ago. Alcaraz won that match in dominant fashion, 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (4), and needed just two hours and 28 minutes. Today's opening set lasted 93 minutes.\n\nThe near-capacity crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier, which includes Serena Williams, has been electric throughout with fan loyalty seemingly divided between the two superstars. At one point late in the first set, they simultaneously chanted \"No-vak\" and \"Car-los\" until neither name was identifiable.\n\nDjokovic, who had knee surgery less than two months ago and is still wearing a brace, called Alcaraz the \"favorite\" entering the match, and he has been animated throughout the match during the big points. In his four previous Olympic appearances, his best result was a bronze medal in 2008.\n\nSince tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, Williams (2012) is the only singles champion to have won the gold medal without dropping a set. Djokovic is on track to join her, but will he able to hold on? We'll find out soon enough. -- D'Arcy Maine\n\n9:43 a.m. ET -- Anthony Edwards continues to make the most of his time in Paris\n\nTeam USA men's basketball is on a mission in France to bring home gold and show the world that the road to basketball glory still runs through the U.S. But that doesn't mean they're not enjoying the ride along the way -- and no player is enjoying the ride more than Edwards.\n\nThe star Minnesota Timberwolves guard has thrived on the court -- highlighted by his 26-point outing in the squad's last game against Puerto Rico, windmill dunk and all. But off the court he's been getting the full Olympic experience as well: table tennis fandom and all. -- READ MORE\n\n9:27 a.m. ET -- Rahm looking to close things out\n\nJon Rahm was tied for first place entering men's golf's fourth and final round. Now, halfway through a gold-medal-deciding round, he stands alone in front of the pack. Through nine holes, he has shot a torrid 5-under par -- just one other competitor in the field has been better so far Sunday. Rahm's lead in first place has grown to three strokes with nine holes left to play.\n\n9:21 a.m. ET -- A star-studded men's tennis singles final\n\nIt would be difficult to prearrange a better gold medal match then the one that the Olympic men's tennis singles bracket delivered. Just weeks after meeting in the Wimbledon final, 37-year-old legend Novak Djokovic will square off once more with ascendant 21-year-old star Carlos Alcaraz. They have played each other six times head-to-head, entering their latest match with an even 3-3 record. Djokovic took home victory in their lone meeting at Roland Garros, with the win coming in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open.\n\n8:36 a.m. ET -- More trouble in the Seine\n\nThe saga of the Seine continues at the 2024 Games, as it was determined late Saturday night that training for the triathlon mixed relay event would be canceled due to concerns with the water's quality -- not the first time this Games where the river's quality has caused delays.\n\nRain leading up to Saturday created heightened levels of pollution in the river, a similar cause to the postponement of the men's triathlon competition earlier in the week.\n\n8:14 a.m. ET -- An unconventional racing strategy\n\nThe Olympics have marked the debut of the repechage round in certain track and field events, a second chance for competitors who failed to qualify for the semifinals from their preliminary heats. For American Freddie Crittenden, the new wrinkle offered a chance to alter his approach to the competition.\n\nWith his heat in the 110-meter hurdles looming, Crittenden knew he was nursing a minor injury that might hold him back. His solution? Intentionally jog out the initial heat to save energy for the repechage round.\n\nHad Crittenden gone all-in on the heat, he would have needed to finish third place or better to qualify automatically, and if that didn't happen, he would be running in the repechage round anyway. Why not take the opportunity to tax his still-not-100% body a little less than his competition ahead of the second-chance round, Crittenden reasoned.\n\n\"I decided to just not make an emotional choice,\" he said after the heat. \"Make a smart choice. Give my body time to recover a little bit from being aggravated.\"\n\n7:29 a.m. ET -- Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone starts off gold medal defense strong\n\nHaving just broken her own world record in the 400m hurdles earlier this summer -- the fifth time she's reset the world record in the event -- expectations couldn't have been much higher for McLaughlin-Levrone as she entered her first chance to run her signature event in Paris.\n\nShe still met them in stride though, leading the pack throughout her heat by a considerable margin en route to a comfortable first round success. McLaughlin-Levron will race in the event's semifinal round on Tuesday.\n\n7:14 a.m. ET -- 'Powerful' American 200m sprinters win heats\n\nTeam USA's women's sprinters got off to very strong start Sunday morning at Stade de France, when all three 200-meter runners won their respective opening-round heats.\n\nIt started with two-time Olympian Gabby Thomas. The current world's No. 2 in the event breezed through the second heat in 22.20 seconds, easing up in the final 10 meters after it was clear she would win and move on to the semifinal. Thomas' time held up as the fastest for the day.\n\nFollowing Thomas' run, 2024 NCAA champion McKenzie Long dominated her first round in 22.55 seconds, and fellow first-time Olympian Brittany Brown cruised to her own victory in 22.38 seconds.\n\nAll three Americans will be in Monday's semifinal.\n\n\"My coach wanted me to go out there and win, but be dominant and smooth and in control and that's what we did,\" Brown said.\n\nBrown ran a comfortable race, coming out the blocks quickly and owning the heat from start to finish. Her first few steps were filled with power -- just like her eyelids.\n\nSporting glittering nails and a purple and blue eye shadow, Brown raced in style. She said the fitting eye shadow was part of Danessa Myrick's \"I am\" palette series. The specific eye shadow Brown went with Sunday?\n\n\"I am powerful,\" Brown said.\n\nFor the semifinals, she said she plans on trotting out the \"I am brave\" color series, \"because I'm going to need to be brave.\"\n\nA first-time Olympian, the 29-year-old's top international accomplishment to this point was a silver earned at the 2019 world championships.\n\nMoments before the start of Sunday's 200-meter races, Jamaican favorite Shericka Jackson withdrew. It remains unclear why she pulled out of the race. Her non-start came one day after her countrywoman Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce also withdrew from the 100 meters due to an injury, her coach said.\n\nJackson also pulled out of the 100 meters just before the Olympics began, but indicated she was not injured. --Coley Harvey\n\n7:11 a.m. ET -- Scheffler finding his groove\n\nScottie Scheffler spent the first three rounds of the Olympic golf circuit lingering between sixth and 10th place. Now, the world No. 1 is heating up and making a move. Back-to-back birdies have fired Scheffler to a 3-under par start to the fourth and final round, and he's climbed up the standings to third position, just one stroke back from the first-place tie between Spain's Jon Rahm and American teammate Xander Schauffele. Rahm and Schauffele teed off for the final round roughly 20 minutes after Scheffler got underway.\n\n6:50 a.m. ET -- Holloway cruises in preliminary heat\n\nThe reigning back-to-back world champion in the 110-meter hurdles, Grant Holloway arrived in Paris with intentions of upgrading his silver medal from the 2020 Games to gold.\n\nHe looked on pace to just that in a dominant Round 1 showing, flying out of the blocks en route to a blistering 13.01 finish -- good for the best time from any first round heat.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"},

This victory not only marked a significant milestone in his illustrious career but also created a heartwarming moment that captivated the world.\n\nDjokovic's path to Olympic gold was anything but easy. He faced Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in a nail biting final, ultimately prevailing in two tightly contested sets, 7-6, 7-6. The match showcased the exceptional talent and resilience of both players, but it was Djokovic who emerged victorious, achieving a dream that had eluded him for years.\n\nAs the final point was won, the 37 year old Djokovic was overwhelmed with emotion. He broke down in tears, the weight of his accomplishment fully sinking in. This gold medal was more than just a personal victory; it was a moment of national pride for Serbia. Djokovic had previously won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but this gold solidified his status among the legends of the sport.\n\nDjokovic's emotional reaction reached its peak when he rushed to the stands to embrace his family. His daughter, Tara, was there to share the moment, holding up a sign that read, \"Tata je najbolji,\" meaning \"Dad is the best.\" The heartfelt hug between father and daughter quickly went viral, touching hearts around the globe.\n\nWith this victory, Djokovic joined the elite ranks of tennis players who have achieved the Career Golden Slam. This prestigious list includes Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, and Serena Williams. The Career Golden Slam is achieved when a player wins all four Grand Slam titles and an Olympic gold medal. Djokovic's triumph in Paris added another golden chapter to his already storied career, which includes 24 Grand Slam titles.\n\nDjokovic's journey to this point has been marked by unparalleled dedication and resilience. He has held the World No. 1 ranking for a record 428 weeks and finished as the year end No. 1 a record eight times. His 24 Grand Slam titles include an astounding 10 Australian Open victories. With his Olympic gold, Djokovic now has 72 major titles, including 40 Masters 1000 titles and 7 ATP Finals.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics were a redemption of sorts for Djokovic. In the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, he narrowly missed out on a bronze medal, finishing fourth. In the 2016 Rio Olympics, he suffered a heartbreaking first round exit. This gold medal, therefore, was not just a win but a testament to his perseverance and indomitable spirit.\n\nThe internet exploded with reactions to the viral video of Djokovic's emotional celebration with his daughter. The sight of one of the greatest tennis players of all time, in tears and sharing a tender moment with his family, resonated deeply with fans and sports enthusiasts alike. Comments flooded social media, praising Djokovic's perseverance and the touching nature of the moment.\n\nOne user on X (formerly Twitter) encapsulated the sentiment perfectly: \"Wow - have never seen Djokovic this emotional ... incredible Sports.\" Another commented, \"He waited for this moment 16 years. Wow.\"\n\nAs Djokovic basked in the glory of his Olympic triumph, he also set his sights on the future. At 37, he continues to defy the odds, showing that age is merely a number when it comes to greatness. His gold medal victory in Paris not only adds to his legacy but also inspires countless aspiring athletes around the world.", "source": {"uri": "technosports.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechnoSports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "remya_babu_s@technosports.co.in", "name": "Remya Babu S", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://technosports.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GUJwd_MWQAA1Ypk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

"Djokovic wins Olympic gold to complete career Golden Slam", "body": "Novak Djokovic defeated Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday to claim a maiden Olympic title and become just the fifth player to complete a career Golden Slam.\n\nThe 37-year-old Serb, competing in his fifth Games, came through 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) in an enthralling final at Roland Garros to add Olympic gold to his 24 Grand Slam triumphs.\n\nVictory allowed him to join Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Steffi Graf and the watching Serena Williams as the only players to win all four Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic singles gold.\n\nHe also became the oldest singles champion since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988 and shattered Alcaraz's bid to add gold to the French Open and Wimbledon titles he has already pocketed this summer.\n\nAn emotional Djokovic celebrated by holding aloft the Serbian flag on court before clambering into the players' box to embrace his wife and children.\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" said Djokovic, who had lost heavily to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final last month.\n\n- 'Finally I did it' -\n\n\"I put my body, my family on the line to win gold and finally I did it.\"\n\nAlcaraz was distraught and wept as he attempted to conduct a TV interview.\n\n\"Three hours, a big battle with tough moments,\" said the 21-year-old after a final in which neither player dropped serve. \"It's very painful to lose.\"\n\nDjokovic carved out a break point in the second game of the opener and three more in the fourth, all saved by the Spaniard.\n\nMore from this section Vietnam's Communist Party names To Lam top leader Philippines says Chinatown fire kills 11 Colombia rebels to halt attacks during UN biodiversity summit\n\nThen it was the Serb's turn to demonstrate his famed powers of resilience, fighting off three break points in the fifth game and another five in a marathon ninth game.\n\nIn a rollercoaster duel, Alcaraz saved a set point in the 12th game but his veteran opponent dominated the tiebreak to claim the opener after a breathless 93 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThere was no let-up in the second set, scintillating shot-making alongside rousing defence with Alcaraz fighting off the final's 14th break point in the third game.\n\nAgain the set was decided by a tie-break and it was Djokovic with history on the line again sweeping through to take victory after two hours and 50 minutes.\n\nLorenzo Musetti defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets on Saturday to claim the bronze medal, giving Italy its first men's tennis medal in 100 years.\n\nLater Sunday, Russian athletes can claim their first gold of the Games when Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider face the Italian team of Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini in the women's doubles.\n\nRussian competitors are taking part in the Olympics as neutrals following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022.\n\nIf Andreeva and Shnaider win gold, their achievement will not be recognised in the medals table while both the Russian flag and national anthem will be banned from the podium ceremony.\n\nCristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo, the Spanish eighth seeds, defeated the Czech pair of Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-2 in the bronze medal match.\n\ndj/jw", "source":

I can't wait for what's coming up in the next 48 hours.\"\n\nAnd it was not long before fans could gain a glimpse into what the star meant by this, as he was later spotted dancing with his fellow Serbian athletes after arriving back in the Olympic village.\n\nIn a video, Djokovic can be seen dancing joyfully in the middle of a circle whilst draped in a Serbia flag, as his teammates skip around him with traditional music playing in the background.\n\nPrior to this, the 37-year-old had enjoyed the momentous occasion with some of his fans, embracing supporters gathered outside of the Philippe Chatrier court, and jumping up and down to their chanting of his name.\n\nThe jubilant scenes could arguably have been predicted ahead of the tournament, as Djokovic made it clear just how much he wanted to clinch the only prize that has eluded him in his career.\n\nIn a video uploaded on TikTok before his first match at the Paris Games, the all-time great is shown praying for a gold medal.\n\nDespite winning bronze whilst still 21 at Beijing 2008, he then failed to upgrade his medal in the three Olympic campaigns which followed, Djokovic's age meant that this summer was surely his last realistic chance of answering his prayers.\n\nAnd the sporting legend certainly had to be at his best to write his name into history, with Spain's Alcaraz coming into the final off the back of successive Grand Slam wins at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.\n\nThe latter major victory came against Djokovic just three weeks ago, where he was beaten convincingly in straight sets, but there was to be no repeat of this in the Games decider.\n\nAfter the match, Alcaraz also struggled to contain his emotions, as he was reduced to tears in his on-court interview.\n\nOn losing the final, he remarked: \"It's painful to lose the way I lost this match. I had my chances to probably be up in the match. I couldn't take it.\n\nDespite this, the 21-year-old admitted: \"I'm a bit disappointed but honestly I'll leave the court with my head really really high.\n\n\"I gave everything I had. Fighting for Spain was everything to me. I'm proud with the way I played today.\"\n\nDjokovic's victory sees him join fellow greats Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal in winning all four Grand Slams and the Olympic singles final.\n\nMeanwhile his six ATP Finals victories make him just the second man to complete the Career Super Slam after Agassi.\n\nWith his maiden gold medal cementing his status among the sport's very best, fans can expect to see Djokovic continue his celebrations over the coming days.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_riley@talksport.com", "name": "Martha Riley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/08/djokovic-olympics-celebration-2.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Djokovic sought the one accolade that has always evaded him. It was likely his last chance, given that he will be 41 years old for the LA 2028 Games. Meanwhile, Alcaraz hoped to continue an incredible summer after winning the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nBoth men were playing for the gold medal for the first time. Before this year, Djokovic had a 0/3 record in Olympics semi-finals while Alcaraz had never played in the Games. Under the watchful eye of four-time gold medallist Serena Williams, seated in the front row, Alcaraz survived a marathon opening game, saving a break point to level at 1-1.\n\nThe fans were divided - they to-and-froed between chants of \"Nole\" and cries of \"Carlos\". After digging himself out of a 0-30 hole, the Serb had three more chances to break. He ripped a forehand return winner straight past Alcaraz and the 15,000-strong crowd responded with a chorus of \"Idemo\". But the 21-year-old saved them all and Djokovic could only laugh as the fickle fans turned, booing when he moaned towards his box after missing his chances.\n\nIt was the world No. 2's turn to save three break points but, like Alcaraz, he held on and the rollercoaster continued. The ninth game became a significant battle, lasting 15 minutes as Djokovic saved five more break points and roared in celebration. It looked like it could be crucial but Alcaraz held his nerve and kept himself in the set for 5-5.", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yasmin_syed@express.co.uk", "name": "Yasmin Syed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antol\u00edn_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antol\u00edn Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/72/1200x630/5541969.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

She's the first American to medal twice on bars in Olympic history.\n\nOn the track, Noah Lyles will look to earn a medal in the men's 100-meter final. But first he must advance past the semifinals. Lyles admitted he underestimated the field in his preliminary round run on Saturday, finishing second in the race.\n\nSunday marks the last day of the swimming events at the Paris Games with three finals. Team USA's Gretchen Walsh can win her fourth medal of Paris in the women's 50-meter freestyle, while American swimmer Kate Douglass looks for the same total as she competes in the women's 4x100-meter medley relay.\n\nAlso headlining Sunday's events was the men's singles gold medal match in Tennis. In a rematch of the Wimbledon 2024 final, Novak Djokovic dispatched Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros to give Djokovic, of Serbia, his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nHere's what to look out for on Sunday.\n\nScott Scheffler shot a course record-tying 62 to come from behind to win gold.\n\nNovak Djokovic is an Olympic gold medalist at last.\n\nAfter a career filled with history-making accomplishments and 24 major titles, the 37-year-old finally achieved the lone achievement that has eluded him in four previous Olympic appearances.\n\nAnd he did it with a statement-making win over Carlos Alcaraz, his young rival who defeated him in the Wimbledon final just three weeks ago. Needing tiebreaks in both sets, Djokovic ultimately got the job done, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) in an epic battle full of electrifying rallies and highlight reel-worthy points.\n\nIt has been a tough season for Djokovic -- he hadn't won a title all year entering the Olympics, marking his worst start of a season since 2006 -- and he underwent knee surgery in June. He was understandably emotional at the match's conclusion on Sunday.\n\nWhen it was over he immediately crouched in near-disbelief, and then seconds later, after exchanging a warm hug with Alcaraz, he went back out onto the court and fell to his knees. He leaned over and remained there as the crowd -- even those who had been waving Spanish flags -- gave him a standing ovation.\n\nDjokovic then sobbed in his chair before running over to his family with a Serbian flag. He hugged his children while still crying.\n\nAfter advancing to Sunday's final -- already resulting in his best result at the Olympics -- Djokovic said he was ecstatic to know he was bringing home a medal.\n\n\"Just to secure a higher medal for the first time for my country, whatever happens on Sunday, [there's] huge pride, honor and happiness,\" Djokovic said. \"It's why I celebrated [on court] the way I did, and I still feel like I need to celebrate that because it's a big success.\"\n\nDjokovic now joins Serena Williams, who was in attendance for part of the match, as the only Olympic singles champions to not drop a set en route to the gold.\n\nThe silver marked the 21-year-old Alcaraz's first Olympic medal. Italy's Lorenzo Musetti earned the bronze medal on Friday with a three-set win over Canada's Felix Auger Aliassime.\n\nThree days after earning her second Olympic all-around medal, Suni Lee earned her second bronze in uneven bars. She now holds six Olympic medals, with one more opportunity in Monday's balance beam final.\n\nLee was the last gymnast to compete in the uneven bars final and needed to score higher than 14.766 to bump Belgium's Nina Derwael, the reigning Olympic champ, off the podium. Lee qualified third into the final with a 14.866 and earned an identical score during Thursday's all-around. Just like in that meet, she mounted the bars knowing a medal was within her grasp.\n\nHer performance was nearly flawless until she took one step on her landing. The crowd erupted when her score appeared. She didn't match her qualifying score, but her 14.8 was once again good enough for bronze.\n\nAlgeria's Kaylia Nemour, 17, the reigning world silver medalist on uneven bars, won Africa's first ever Olympic medal in gymnastics. She scored a massive 15.7, earned by combining a 7.2 difficulty score with excellent execution. Born and raised in France, Nemour competed for France until 2022, and this crowd reacted with no less pride when she stuck her double-layout dismount than for every French gymnast who's competed here in Paris.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Qiu Qiyuan of China hit a flawless routine with gorgeous lines and time-stopping handstands and nailed her landing. She matched Nemour's incredible difficulty score but earned two-tenths lower in execution for a 15.5 and bronze.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, China's Yang Liu won gold in the rings, followed by his teammate, Jingyuan Zou, who earned silver. Greece's Eleftherios Petrounias took bronze.\n\nFrance's Samir Ait Said dismounted to a Biles-like response from this majority French crowd. His score placed him just off the medals podium in fourth place and let's just say the crowd did not agree with the judging panel. -- Alyssa Roenigk\n\nJust one set stands between Novak Djokovic and his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe Olympic title has been perhaps the only thing in the sport Djokovic, the 24-time major champion, has yet to win and he's been open about just how much it would mean to him. On Sunday, facing Carlos Alcaraz, his young nemesis, Djokovic was pushed to the brink but ultimately held off the 21-year-old Spaniard in a tiebreak, 7-6 (3), to take the opening set.\n\nIt's so far been a far more compelling match than their lopsided clash in the Wimbledon final just three weeks ago. Alcaraz won that match in dominant fashion, 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (4), and needed just two hours and 28 minutes. Today's opening set lasted 93 minutes.\n\nThe near-capacity crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier, which includes Serena Williams, has been electric throughout with fan loyalty seemingly divided between the two superstars. At one point late in the first set, they simultaneously chanted \"No-vak\" and \"Car-los\" until neither name was identifiable.\n\nDjokovic, who had knee surgery less than two months ago and is still wearing a brace, called Alcaraz the \"favorite\" entering the match, and he has been animated throughout the match during the big points. In his four previous Olympic appearances, his best result was a bronze medal in 2008.\n\nSince tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, Williams (2012) is the only singles champion to have won the gold medal without dropping a set. Djokovic is on track to join her, but will he able to hold on? We'll find out soon enough. -- D'Arcy Maine\n\nTeam USA men's basketball is on a mission in France to bring home gold and show the world that the road to basketball glory still runs through the U.S. But that doesn't mean they're not enjoying the ride along the way -- and no player is enjoying the ride more than Edwards.\n\nThe star Minnesota Timberwolves guard has thrived on the court -- highlighted by his 26-point outing in the squad's last game against Puerto Rico, windmill dunk and all. But off the court he's been getting the full Olympic experience as well: table tennis fandom and all. -- READ MORE\n\nJon Rahm was tied for first place entering men's golf's fourth and final round. Now, halfway through a gold-medal-deciding round, he stands alone in front of the pack. Through nine holes, he has shot a torrid 5-under par -- just one other competitor in the field has been better so far Sunday. Rahm's lead in first place has grown to three strokes with nine holes left to play.\n\nIt would be difficult to prearrange a better gold medal match then the one that the Olympic men's tennis singles bracket delivered. Just weeks after meeting in the Wimbledon final, 37-year-old legend Novak Djokovic will square off once more with ascendant 21-year-old star Carlos Alcaraz. They have played each other six times head-to-head, entering their latest match with an even 3-3 record. Djokovic took home victory in their lone meeting at Roland Garros, with the win coming in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open.\n\nThe saga of the Seine continues at the 2024 Games, as it was determined late Saturday night that training for the triathlon mixed relay event would be canceled due to concerns with the water's quality -- not the first time this Games where the river's quality has caused delays.\n\nRain leading up to Saturday created heightened levels of pollution in the river, a similar cause to the postponement of the men's triathlon competition earlier in the week.\n\nThe Olympics have marked the debut of the repechage round in certain track and field events, a second chance for competitors who failed to qualify for the semifinals from their preliminary heats. For American Freddie Crittenden, the new wrinkle offered a chance to alter his approach to the competition.\n\nWith his heat in the 110-meter hurdles looming, Crittenden knew he was nursing a minor injury that might hold him back. His solution? Intentionally jog out the initial heat to save energy for the repechage round.\n\nHad Crittenden gone all-in on the heat, he would have needed to finish third place or better to qualify automatically, and if that didn't happen, he would be running in the repechage round anyway. Why not take the opportunity to tax his still-not-100% body a little less than his competition ahead of the second-chance round, Crittenden reasoned.\n\n\"I decided to just not make an emotional choice,\" he said after the heat. \"Make a smart choice. Give my body time to recover a little bit from being aggravated.\"\n\nHaving just broken her own world record in the 400m hurdles earlier this summer -- the fifth time she's reset the world record in the event -- expectations couldn't have been much higher for McLaughlin-Levrone as she entered her first chance to run her signature event in Paris.\n\nShe still met them in stride though, leading the pack throughout her heat by a considerable margin en route to a comfortable first round success. McLaughlin-Levron will race in the event's semifinal round on Tuesday.\n\nTeam USA's women's sprinters got off to very strong start Sunday morning at Stade de France, when all three 200-meter runners won their respective opening-round heats.\n\nIt started with two-time Olympian Gabby Thomas. The current world's No. 2 in the event breezed through the second heat in 22.20 seconds, easing up in the final 10 meters after it was clear she would win and move on to the semifinal. Thomas' time held up as the fastest for the day.\n\nFollowing Thomas' run, 2024 NCAA champion McKenzie Long dominated her first round in 22.55 seconds, and fellow first-time Olympian Brittany Brown cruised to her own victory in 22.38 seconds.\n\nAll three Americans will be in Monday's semifinal.\n\n\"My coach wanted me to go out there and win, but be dominant and smooth and in control and that's what we did,\" Brown said.\n\nBrown ran a comfortable race, coming out the blocks quickly and owning the heat from start to finish. Her first few steps were filled with power -- just like her eyelids.\n\nSporting glittering nails and a purple and blue eye shadow, Brown raced in style. She said the fitting eye shadow was part of Danessa Myrick's \"I am\" palette series. The specific eye shadow Brown went with Sunday?\n\n\"I am powerful,\" Brown said.\n\nFor the semifinals, she said she plans on trotting out the \"I am brave\" color series, \"because I'm going to need to be brave.\"\n\nA first-time Olympian, the 29-year-old's top international accomplishment to this point was a silver earned at the 2019 world championships.\n\nMoments before the start of Sunday's 200-meter races, Jamaican favorite Shericka Jackson withdrew. It remains unclear why she pulled out of the race. Her non-start came one day after her countrywoman Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce also withdrew from the 100 meters due to an injury, her coach said.\n\nJackson also pulled out of the 100 meters just before the Olympics began, but indicated she was not injured. --Coley Harvey\n\nScottie Scheffler spent the first three rounds of the Olympic golf circuit lingering between sixth and 10th place. Now, the world No. 1 is heating up and making a move. Back-to-back birdies have fired Scheffler to a 3-under par start to the fourth and final round, and he's climbed up the standings to third position, just one stroke back from the first-place tie between Spain's Jon Rahm and American teammate Xander Schauffele. Rahm and Schauffele teed off for the final round roughly 20 minutes after Scheffler got underway.\n\nThe reigning back-to-back world champion in the 110-meter hurdles, Grant Holloway arrived in Paris with intentions of upgrading his silver medal from the 2020 Games to gold.\n\nHe looked on pace to just that in a dominant Round 1 showing, flying out of the blocks en route to a blistering 13.01 finish -- good for the best time from any first round heat.", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You compete in four Grand Slams every year, whereas the Olympics occur only once every four years.\"\n\nDespite the outcome, Alcaraz found solace in \"knowing that I exerted my utmost effort.\"\n\n\"Undeniably, this week, this tournament has held significant meaning for me,\" he shared. \"I will carry it with me throughout my life, throughout my career, without a doubt. Competing with Rafa, securing my first Olympics medal -- hopefully not the final one -- has been a remarkable experience.\"\n\nAlcaraz arrived in Paris amidst the excitement of participating in the doubles tournament alongside his childhood idol Nadal, who clinched the singles gold in his Olympic premiere in Beijing in 2008.\n\nAlcaraz and Nadal suffered a 6-2, 6-4 defeat to the fourth-seeded American pair of Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram in last week's quarterfinals.\n\nThe showdown against Djokovic marked a rematch of the previous two Wimbledon finals, both secured by Alcaraz, including the most recent one.\n\n\"During the crucial moments, in the tough situations, in the tiebreaks, he exhibited remarkable gameplay,\" Alcaraz remarked about Djokovic. \"He was hungry for the gold medal.

"Djokovic wins Olympic gold to complete career Golden Slam", "body": "Novak Djokovic defeated Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday to claim a maiden Olympic title and become just the fifth player to complete a career Golden Slam.\n\nThe 37-year-old Serb, competing in his fifth Games, came through 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) in an enthralling final at Roland Garros to add Olympic gold to his 24 Grand Slam triumphs.\n\nVictory allowed him to join Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Steffi Graf and the watching Serena Williams as the only players to win all four Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic singles gold.\n\nHe also became the oldest singles champion since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988 and shattered Alcaraz's bid to add gold to the French Open and Wimbledon titles he has already pocketed this summer.\n\nAn emotional Djokovic celebrated by holding aloft the Serbian flag on court before clambering into the players' box to embrace his wife and children.\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" said Djokovic, who had lost heavily to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final last month.\n\n- 'Finally I did it' -\n\n\"I put my body, my family on the line to win gold and finally I did it.\"\n\nAlcaraz was distraught and wept as he attempted to conduct a TV interview.\n\n\"Three hours, a big battle with tough moments,\" said the 21-year-old after a final in which neither player dropped serve. \"It's very painful to lose.\"\n\nDjokovic carved out a break point in the second game of the opener and three more in the fourth, all saved by the Spaniard.\n\nThen it was the Serb's turn to demonstrate his famed powers of resilience, fighting off three break points in the fifth game and another five in a marathon ninth game.\n\nIn a rollercoaster duel, Alcaraz saved a set point in the 12th game but his veteran opponent dominated the tiebreak to claim the opener after a breathless 93 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThere was no let-up in the second set, scintillating shot-making alongside rousing defence with Alcaraz fighting off the final's 14th break point in the third game.\n\nAgain the set was decided by a tie-break and it was Djokovic with history on the line again sweeping through to take victory after two hours and 50 minutes.\n\nLorenzo Musetti defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets on Saturday to claim the bronze medal, giving Italy its first men's tennis medal in 100 years.\n\nLater Sunday, Russian athletes can claim their first gold of the Games when Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider face the Italian team of Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini in the women's doubles.\n\nRussian competitors are taking part in the Olympics as neutrals following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022.\n\nIf Andreeva and Shnaider win gold, their achievement will not be recognised in the medals table while both the Russian flag and national anthem will be banned from the podium ceremony.\n\nCristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo, the Spanish eighth seeds, defeated the Czech pair of Karolina Muchova and Linda Noskova 6-2, 6-2 in the bronze medal match.\n\ndj/jw\n\nMore

The 37-year-old from Belgrade has fulfilled his dream of winning the gold medal at the Olympics, defeating Spaniard ace Carlos Alcaraz in two tiebreaks in the final of the Olympic tournament in Paris.\n\nThe Serbian champion has once again proved that he is a living legend in the sport and can thrill fans like few other athletes. In a season full of difficulties and where he had not won a title before yesterday, Nole showed an exceptional performance against a 16-year-old. The Olympics had not been a lucky event for Djokovic before this edition, but the Serbian showed his best version at the last useful opportunity. The level of the Serbian has grown with the passing of rounds and his performance in the final was near to perfection.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion has shown the world that he is still hungry and motivated to win big titles, even though the signs of age are starting to show on his body. Novak burst into tears after beating Alcaraz on the iconic Philippe Chatrier, took the flag of Serbia and went to embrace all members of his family.\n\nNovak Djokovic has rewritten history and confirmed that he is the best tennis player ever without any doubt. After completing his mission at the Paris Olympics, ATP legend Djokovic went to the Olympic village where he celebrated dancing with other Serbian athletes.\n\nThe feat accomplished yesterday by Novak Djokovic is incredible. After a whole career dedicated to tennis, winning any kind of trophy that came before him, he managed to put on the gold medal at the Olympic Games. A dream realized for the Serbian champion, who had always escaped this great goal, but which he had always well imprinted in mind, despite being 37 years old. Nole did it yesterday by beating the fittest player in the world, Carlos Alcaraz, on the court where he is most comfortable. All at the age of 37. The Serbian tennis player enters the history of his country, but increasingly dominant in that of this sport, the oldest player to win a gold medal. Crazy, considering that former number one won the Olympics without losing a set, which no one had ever done before.\n\nNole had been dreaming of this day for a long time: \"Doubts always exist, but faith and the belief that I can achieve my goals are always stronger. I was aware that this was my last chance to win an Olympic gold, so I had to focus fully on my goal. I know that I have already won all the big tournaments, but I still love this sport, I love competing, training day after day, continuing to improve and taking care of my body. Tennis means a lot to me and I do my best to give back to this sport everything it has given me. I don't know what the future holds, now is the time to celebrate.\"\n\nNovak Djokovic's numbers in these years are legendary, the Serbian tennis player was running behind the pair of champions composed by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal but with work and without giving up he never managed to overcome it, He is the GOAT of this sport.\n\n24 Grand Slam titles, an endless series of wins between the ATP Finals and Masters 1000 and the desire to never give up. This year Djokovic had won 0 titles, for many he was on the sunset and they saw him now behind the new generation that advanced. The defeats against Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz had even made his fans doubt and in the final everyone saw him almost doomed. Djokovic once again denied everything and offered a monumental performance.\n\nDjokovic's next big goal should be the US Open at the end of August, where he will be called to defend last year's title. The Serbian champion should also play in the Cincinnati Masters 1000. Despite his weakened knee, despite facing the best tennis player in the world right now, but Nole is exalted in difficult times and many on social media have celebrated his greatness.\n\nFormer world number one Andy Roddick has been clear and has sent a message about his victory over Alcaraz.

Djokovic clinched the first set 7-6 after a grueling 1 hour and 43 minutes of extraordinary play. It left everyone buzzing about the high-level tennis on display.\n\nFans and analysts took to social media and were taken aback by the performance of these two tennis wizards.\n\nThe way Alcaraz matched Djokovic almost point to point, was as if it was tennis coming from the Gods. Watching this final was a delight for every single person present at the Philippe Chatrier court and on screens everywhere around the world.\n\nAlcaraz unleashed powerful, booming groundstrokes, while Djokovic demonstrated impeccable movement and court management. This proved why the Serb is one of the greatest players of all time. Every point was hard-fought, and the intensity never wavered, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.\n\nHeading into the second set, the anticipation was palpable. Fans wondered if the match could maintain the breathtaking pace and quality of the first set. Remarkably, it did. The second set mirrored the first.\n\nWith both players battling fiercely, pushing each other to their limits. Once again, the set went to a tiebreak, and once again, Djokovic emerged victorious with a 7-2 win.\n\nThis could possibly be Djokovic's last Olympic appearance and there couldn't have been a better way to cap off his journey at the event, than with a gold medal. It is clear that this match would be remembered for years to come, as would the Djokovic-Alcaraz rivalry. One can't predict when the two players would play next.\n\nBut it cemented Djokovic and Alcaraz's places in tennis history. While Alcaraz ended up crying after finishing second best in a match which could have gone either way, Djokovic had happy tears to shed and trembling hands which showed how much the win means for him and Serbia. These moments come once in many years, making it special as it was also a rare battle of generations at such a big event in which the senior statesman won.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rishika_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rishika Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/9dbfb296-djokovic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

In a classical final featuring the tournament's number one seed, and the world's number two seed, Djokovic of Serbia defeated Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, 7-6, 7-6. In the first set tiebreak, Djokovic won 7-3, and in the second set tiebreak, Djokovic won 7-2.\n\nThis was Djokovic's first Olympic gold medal in men's tennis. He has previously won the Australian Open 10 times, the French Open three times, Wimbledon seven times and the United States Open four times. Other players to win the career golden grand slam in singles are Steffi Graf of Germany, Andre Agassi of the United States, Rafael Nadal of Spain and Serna Williams of the United States. What was also special about Sunday was the fact that Sara Errani of Italy won the career golden grand slam in women's doubles.\n\nI actually agree with the post above. What Graff achieved in 1988 (won all four majors and the Olympic gold medal) was quite frankly mind boggling, and deserves to be on a pedestal over everyone else who achieved the career grand slam.\n\nWe cannot forget that Djokoic has won eight different ATP Masters 1000 Series events and the ATP Finals as well.\n\nA lot of credit needs to go to Djokovic's remarkable longevity, and that he continues to play high level tennis in his late 30s. It should also be noted that Alcaraz is only 21 years of age, and Djokovic beat a player who was 16 years younger than he was.\n\nThis statistic is very noteworthy. Prior to beating Alcaraz, Djokovic beat Matthew Ebden of Australia in the first round 6-0, 6-1, Rafael Nadal of Spain in the second round 6-1, 6-4, Dominik Koepfer of Germany in the the third round 7-5, 6-3, Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece in the quarterfinals 6-3, 7-6, and Lorenzo Mussetti of Italy in the semifinals, 6-4, 6-2.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sports Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_freeborn@thesportsdaily.com", "name": "Jeremy Freeborn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Errani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sara Errani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Koepfer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Koepfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Ebden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Ebden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Tsitsipas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefanos Tsitsipas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://thesportsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/USATSI_16250112-scaled-e1682166512514.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The Serbian defeated the Spaniard 7-6, 7-6 in one the most iconic and nail-biting finals in Olympics history to clinch gold medal after 16 years. Novak has made it to another elite list called the 'Career Golden Slam', a term used for players who have won all grand slam titles and an Olympic gold medal in single's history.\n\nDjokovic who usually is a cool and composed person after creating such historic moments could not keep it together and bursted into tears after winning gold in Paris. ('You Rock PR Sreejesh;' Fans Go Crazy As India Hockey Team Cruise Into Semis With Win Against Great Britain)\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nDjokovic's impressive career already featured a men's-record 24 Grand Slam titles and the most weeks spent at No. 1 in the rankings by any man or woman. It also already contained a Summer Olympics medal, from 2008, but it was a bronze -- and he has made clear that simply was not sufficient. (Paris Olympics 2024: Neeraj Chopra To Men's Hockey Team; Last Medal Winning Hopes For India - In Pics)\n\nUntil he got past bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the semifinals Friday, Djokovic was 0-3 in that round at the Games. He lost to the eventual gold winner each time: Rafael Nadal at Beijing in 2008, Andy Murray at London in 2012, and Alexander Zverev in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nIn Paris, wearing a gray sleeve over the right knee that required surgery for a torn meniscus two months ago, Djokovic faced Nadal in the second round and eliminated his longtime rival in straight sets. Now Djokovic is the oldest man to win the singles gold in his sport since 1908 -- and prevented Spain's Alcaraz, who is 21, from becoming the youngest.

It became clear, though, that this meant quite a bit to the Serbian star, and he revealed after his match that this was the biggest win of his entire career.\n\nDjokovic won a bronze medal back at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, but he hadn't won a medal since then, which is rather crazy to think about considering how consistently dominant he's been throughout his career.\n\nWhile winning championships for yourself is obviously a great feeling, winning a gold medal for your country may be an even better feeling.\n\nThat appears to be Djokovic's line of thought, and now that he has won one of the only awards in his career he hadn't secured yet, his case as the greatest tennis player of all time has gotten even stronger.\n\nRelated: Simone Biles' GOAT Necklace Goes Viral After Historic Gold Medal Victory", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_crisafulli@postandcourier.com", "name": "Owen Crisafulli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

But nor would Alcaraz genuflect to the seniority of the Serb.\n\nAnd so the first set went on, for more than an hour-and-a-half.\n\nAlcaraz fought off five break points, including storming back from 0-40 down in the fourth game of the match, while Djokovic weathered eight, serving his way through six deuces to eventually reach 5-4.\n\nDjokovic appeared to be the one just hanging on in the match, with Alcaraz's athleticism, energy and shot-making drawing more than a few rounds of applause and approving wry smiles from the Serb.\n\nBut, when they reached the tie-break, Djokovic showed the poise of a man who's played 37 major finals, rattling off four straight points from the change of ends to take it 7-3.\n\nBoth players looked exhausted between sets -- Djokovic taking a comfort break to change clothes while Alcaraz sat on the court perhaps wondering how the man he so summarily dispatched on the London grass last month was suddenly taking his best shots on the clay at Roland Garros.\n\nAs the second set began, Alcaraz looked tired and uncharacteristically frustrated, but still neither player could break the other's serve.\n\nThe match carried on as it had started, although this time neither gave the other a sniff -- the only break point came in the third game and was quickly snuffed out by an Alcaraz forehand winner.\n\nAs the match approached the three-hour mark, the inevitable became clear once more as they traded holds to love and got back into the tie-break.\n\nAlcaraz, this year's French Open and Wimbledon champion, looked exhausted as his opponent rose to the occasion, powered by the knowledge this fifth Olympic campaign would surely be his last, and closed it out 7-2.\n\nAlcaraz will rue three unforced errors in the final breaker and while it is assumed the 21-year-old four-time grand slam winner will have plenty more chances, both his and Djokovic's post-match tears are evidence of the unique standing and challenge of Olympic glory.",

The former world number 1 was not experiencing an exciting 2024 from a results point of view, having yet to win a title this year before today's feat.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion was considered a clear underdog against Carlos Alcaraz in the gold medal final, but has once again proved to be an immortal legend of the sport. The 37-year-old from Belgrade has expressed his best tennis on the iconic Philippe Chatrier by reversing the predictions of the eve and finally realizing his dream of winning the gold medal for the his country. Nole prevailed in two tiebreaks, making a difference at decisive moments and punishing every mistake made by the young Spaniard. Carlitos was the big favorite on the eve of this final and played a great match, but he did not expect such a level from his opponent.\n\nThe 21-year-old from Murcia burst into tears at the end of the match, He wanted to win the gold medal for Spain and continue his unbeaten period after triumphs at the French Open and the Wimbledon Championships. Djokovic and Alcaraz will both miss the Montreal Masters 1000 next week and should return to the pitch in Cincinnati, the last test before the US Open at the end of August.\n\nThanks to this victory, Novak Djokovic achieved yet another feat of his legendary career. Looking at all his records, it's hard to argue that Nole isn't the greatest tennis player of all time. \"I'm overwhelmed with everything I'm feeling right now. Feeling different emotions. Too proud. Too happy. Thrilled with the possibility to win a gold for the first time in my career for my country,\" Novak Djokovic explained.\n\n\"Because I can be very self critical. I don't know. That's one of the biggest internal battles I keep on fighting with myself. That I feel like I haven't done enough or been enough in my life on and off the court. I know Carlos and Rafa (Nadal), they love to play for Spain. Andy (Murray) loved to play for Great Britain. Roger (Federer) for Switzerland. Alex Zverev won in Tokyo for Germany. You saw the reactions of all these guys when they win. It's something special,\" he added.\n\nThere are now few words to describe Novak Djokovic. When everyone seems to have finished it, he manages to impress again, win and convince as he has done in the last hours. The Serbian tennis player won the gold medal at the Paris Olympics, the last huge achievement that was missing from his immense palmar\u00e9s and now Nole has literally won everything possible and imaginable.\n\nSometimes critics of Djokovic find every means to denigrate his legend, Some even in the past has been able to say that Nole won Slam only thanks to lucky draws or episodic situations, the reality at 37 years is quite different. In the last few hours, an impressive figure has emerged on the Balkan tennis player, a figure that has returned to prominence after the victory against Alcaraz.\n\nWinning against the Spaniard at the Paris Olympics, Nole has once again made things clear and is now 4-3 ahead in the previous round with the Spanish, certainly not the only one in this situation. Novak Djokovic is ahead in the previous with all other tennis players present in the Top 15; it is 4 to 3 in front both against the world number one Jannik Sinner and against Carlos Alcaraz, The new one who advances but sees Nole still dominating. There are such clean dominance as the 9-0 in the previous match against Fritz or the 12-1 and 12-2 respectively against Grigor Dimitrov and Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\nThe 37-year-old from Belgrade has beaten Carlos Alcaraz, who played a very good tournament and represents the future of this sport. \"Honestly, I always want to win. In receiving a silver medal, I have to be very proud. I suppose I am building a great career and I hope it continues. As I said, I am proud to be in this position and to bring a medal to Spain. I am quite certain that my time will come. Someday, I will bring the gold medal to Spain. I will wait for that moment and work towards it.

But nor would Alcaraz genuflect to the seniority of the Serb.\n\nAnd so the first set went on, for more than an hour-and-a-half.\n\nAlcaraz fought off five break points, including storming back from 0-40 down in the fourth game of the match, while Djokovic weathered eight, serving his way through six deuces to eventually reach 5-4.\n\nDjokovic appeared to be the one just hanging on in the match, with Alcaraz's athleticism, energy and shot-making drawing more than a few rounds of applause and approving wry smiles from the Serb.\n\nBut, when they reached the tie-break, Djokovic showed the poise of a man who's played 37 major finals, rattling off four straight points from the change of ends to take it 7-3.\n\nBoth players looked exhausted between sets -- Djokovic taking a comfort break to change clothes while Alcaraz sat on the court perhaps wondering how the man he so summarily dispatched on the London grass last month was suddenly taking his best shots on the clay at Roland Garros.\n\nAs the second set began, Alcaraz looked tired and uncharacteristically frustrated, but still neither player could break the other's serve.\n\nThe match carried on as it had started, although this time neither gave the other a sniff -- the only break point came in the third game and was quickly snuffed out by an Alcaraz forehand winner.\n\nAs the match approached the three-hour mark, the inevitable became clear once more as they traded holds to love and got back into the tie-break.\n\nAlcaraz, this year's French Open and Wimbledon champion, looked exhausted as his opponent rose to the occasion, powered by the knowledge this fifth Olympic campaign would surely be his last, and closed it out 7-2.\n\nAlcaraz will rue three unforced errors in the final breaker and while it is assumed the 21-year-old four-time grand slam winner will have plenty more chances, both his and Djokovic's post-match tears are evidence of the unique standing and challenge of Olympic glory.",

Scheffler finished on 19-under, one stroke clear of Fleetwood.\n\nThe 17-year-old Nemour's fast-paced routine featuring complex release-and-catch manoeuvres delighted the crowd who came to support a gymnast who had previously represented France.\n\nFans roared and jumped to their feet as soon as Nemour completed her dismount. She immediately broke down in tears as she handed Algeria its first medal of the Paris Olympics, with her performance scoring a staggering 15.700 points.\n\nNemour was still in complete disbelief after the competition.\n\n\"I can't believe this is happening,\" the teenager said after winning her first gold medal at a major global competition. \"This is too much. I have no words.\"\n\nNemour was up after China's Qiu Qiyuan, the 2023 world champion, who had executed a spectacular routine to briefly top the standings with 15.500 points.\n\n\"When I saw her result of 15.500 points, I told myself that I would really need to fight,\" said Nemour. \"I refocused quickly and got the best mark of my life, and it was the right time to get it.\"\n\nThe Algerian Olympic Committee issued a statement calling Nemour a legend.\n\n\"You showed the world the strength and determination of Algeria with your wonderful victory,\" the statement said.\n\nUS gymnast Sunisa Lee, who claimed a second successive Olympic bronze on the apparatus with 14.800 points, could be seen cheering for Nemour throughout her routine.\n\n\"I was really aiming for the third place because I knew I actually really wanted Kaylia to win, just because she's so incredible,\" said Lee.\n\nNina Derwael of Belgium, the champion at the Tokyo Games, finished 0.034 of a point off the podium.\n\nTop seed Djokovic delivered one of the finest performances of his career to deny Alcaraz and become only the fifth player to win all four singles Grand Slams and the Olympic title.\n\nNeither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest in which the first set alone lasted one hour and 33 minutes as they wrestled for control in a series of spellbinding games.\n\nAlcaraz cracked first in the tiebreak and when another tiebreak was required to decide the second set, Djokovic again found another gear, sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner down the line.\n\nDjokovic roared to the sky and after consoling Alcaraz at the net he fell to his knees and sobbed in the centre of the court before climbing into the crowd to be swamped by his family, friends and team.\n\nWhile Djokovic, the oldest player to win the Olympic singles title since the sport returned to the Games in 1988, cried tears of joy, the 21-year-old Alcaraz was inconsolable after falling short of adding the gold medal to this year's French Open and Wimbledon crowns.\n\nDjokovic had lost three times in Olympic singles semifinals and knew this was his last realistic chance to fill the last remaining space in a trophy cabinet that contains a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles.\n\nAnd how he earned it -- overturning his crushing loss to Alcaraz in last month's Wimbledon final to become the first man to win the Olympic singles without dropping a set.\n\n\"It was an incredible fight and I had to play my best tennis,\" an emotional Djokovic told Eurosport before the medals ceremony as Serbian fans celebrated in the stands.\n\n\"It was fair that the two sets finished in tiebreaks. I put my heart, my soul, everything to win gold.\n\n\"I did it for my country first, for Serbia.\"\n\nDjokovic joins an elite club of Andre Agassi, Rafa Nadal, Serena Williams and Steffi Graf in winning all four Grand Slams and the Olympic title in their careers.\n\nScheffler shot a nine-under-par round of 62 to finish the tournament on 19 under par, one shot ahead of Fleetwood, who took silver.\n\nJapan's Hideki Matsuyama claimed the bronze medal a further shot back, improving on his tied fourth place on home soil in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThe Olympic title adds to a spectacular year for Scheffler, who bagged his second Masters title in April as part of six tour successes.\n\nHis scintillating bogey-free round let him overhaul a four-shot deficit against overnight joint leaders Xander Schauffele and Jon Rahm.\n\nSpaniard Rahm, a two-time major winner, surged into a four-shot lead after a sparkling front nine holes on Sunday before fading like US defending champion Schauffele.\n\nFleetwood stayed in contention until the end but a bogey on the 17th hole left him a shot behind Scheffler and he was unable to birdie the last hole to force a playoff.\n\nFleetwood was cheered on by the large crowds who remember him for starring in Europe's 2018 Ryder Cup win over the US at the same Le Golf National course, south of Paris.\n\nHome supporters were thrilled with a final-day surge by Victor Perez, who hit the second-best final round to end at 16 under in fourth place.

The Serbian tennis star prevailed in a closely contested match, winning both sets through tiebreakers with scores of 7-6 (7/3) and 7-6 (7/2).\n\nHaving participated in five Olympic Games, Djokovic's pursuit of the elusive gold medal finally came to fruition.In a surprising revelation, he also hinted at the possibility of defending his title at the 2028 Los Angeles Games, by which time he will have reached the age of 41.\n\n\"This is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had and the most special feeling,\" said the 37-year-old Serb, as quoted by AFP.\n\n\"I thought carrying the flag at the opening ceremony for my country at the 2012 Olympics was the best feeling an athlete could have until today.\n\n\"Now at the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had.\"\n\nDjokovic's triumph on Sunday saw him achieve a remarkable feat, joining an elite group of tennis legends - Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Steffi Graf, and Serena Williams, who was present to witness the historic moment. These players have accomplished the rare distinction of securing victories in all four Grand Slam tournaments and clinching the Olympic singles gold medal, thereby completing the prestigious career Golden Slam.\n\nPrior to his victory over Alcaraz on Sunday, Djokovic's most notable Olympic performance was in 2008 at the Beijing Games, where he secured a bronze medal. Additionally, he had suffered defeats in three previous semi-final appearances.\n\nFollowing this momentous achievement, Djokovic has expressed his desire to continue competing and has not dismissed the possibility of attempting to win consecutive gold medals at the Los Angeles Olympics, which are scheduled to take place in four years.\n\n\"I want to play in Los Angeles, I enjoy playing for my country in the Olympic Games, in the Davis Cup,\" he added.\n\nDjokovic is the oldest singles champion since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, and he thwarted Alcaraz's attempt to add Olympic gold to his French Open and Wimbledon titles from earlier this summer.\n\nOverwhelmed with emotion, Djokovic fell to his knees on Court Philippe Chatrier, where he has previously won three French Opens. He then proudly raised the Serbian flag before climbing into the players' box to embrace his wife and children.\n\n\"We almost played three hours, the final shot was the only moment when I was sure I could win the match,\" said Djokovic.\n\nHis title on Sunday was the 99th of his career and his first of 2024, coming after a challenging season. Jannik Sinner had taken his place as Australian Open champion and eventually claimed his world number one ranking.\n\nAlcaraz then edged him out at the French Open and prevented him from matching Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon titles.\n\nA knee injury sustained at the French Open required surgery, and his participation in the Olympic semi-finals briefly seemed in jeopardy when he appeared to aggravate the issue.\n\n\"I knew that this could be my last chance of a gold medal,\" added Djokovic at his post-final press conference still draped in his country's flag and with his medal hanging proudly around his neck.\n\n\"I did everything I possibly could to prepare myself for this period. The injury sidetracked me a little bit. But coming into the Olympic Games I felt like a different player in terms of how I moved, how I played.\n\n\"In a way losing heavily to Alcaraz at Wimbledon probably worked in my favour as I knew I couldn't play any worse than that.\"\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Follow along.\n\nAmerican Kristen Faulkner wins women's road race gold\n\nKristen Faulkner used a late charge to pull away from the field and win gold in the women's road race Sunday.\n\nFaulkner, 31, is the first U.S. woman to win gold in the race since Connie Carpenter in 1984.\n\nShe covered the 158-km course in 3:59.23, pulling away from a four-racer pack in the final three kilometers.\n\nMarianna Vos of the Netherlands took silver and Lotte Kopecky of Belgium took bronze in a photo finish, 58 seconds behind Faulkner. - Dave Birkett\n\nScottie Scheffler wins gold medal in Olympic golf\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France -- The legend of Scottie Scheffler keeps growing, and the latest addition is golden.\n\nWorld No. 1 Scheffler caught fire on the back nine at Le Golf National, coming from off the pace to swipe the gold medal for Team USA from a group of elite contenders in the final holes of a enthralling Paris Olympics competition.\n\nOpening the final round four shots back of the leaders, Scheffler tied a course record by firing a 9-under-par 62 on Sunday. He birdied his first three holes of the afternoon and then six of nine after the turn, including a pivotal run of four in a row to seize a place atop the leaderboard that he wouldn't lose.\n\nScheffler's tournament total of 19 under beat silver-medalist Tommy Fleetwood of Great Britain by one shot.

Then, after an embrace with Alcaraz, he dropped to his knees in exhaustion and emotion and stayed down for nearly a minute. Then he went into the stands, embracing his team and family.\n\nEven for a man with 24 Grand Slam titles and nearly every significant record in the sport, this is the crowning achievement that he has long sought. Because this one wasn't just for himself, it was for his beloved Serbia.\n\nAfter gutting defeats in Rio and Tokyo, Djokovic wanted this badly. Even built his year around it. But after injuring his knee during the French Open and having meniscus surgery, it was unclear whether he would even be healthy enough to play the Olympics.\n\nBut Djokovic managed to return in time for Wimbledon, getting to the finals before Alcaraz crushed him in three sets.\n\nThis one was tightly played throughout, with no breaks of serve on either side. In the end, Djokovic was better in both tiebreakers. - Dan Wolken\n\nOlympic golf: Scottie Scheffler blazes to top of leaderboard\n\nThanks to three straight birdies, American golfer Scottie Scheffler is 8-under on the day and now has a share of the lead in the Olympic golf tournament.

That sudden-death format went five rounds with both shooters matching each other until Crovetto Chadid finally bested Rutter.\n\nChile had never won an Olympic shooting gold medal. - Chris Bumbaca\n\nSuni Lee wins bronze medal in thrilling uneven bars final\n\nUSA's Suni Lee went last in the uneven bars final, scoring a 14.800 and winning bronze.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

The second set is underway.\n\nUSA women's volleyball sweeps France\n\nThe Team USA women's volleyball team held off France in three sets, 29-27, 29-27, 25-20, during a preliminary round match.\n\nAndrea Drews led the way for the Americans with 15 points, while Chiaka Ogbogu added 13 and Haleigh Washington and Kathryn Plummer each had 11.

Ellison went second, and his arrow was only slightly outside of his opponent's arrow, which had landed on the line to score a 10.\n\nEllison, a 35-year-old from Arizona who's a world-record holder and considered one of the sport's all-time best, won three consecutive matches Sunday to reach the gold medal final. -- Gentry Estes\n\nJon Rahm gets to 20 under in Olympic men's golf final\n\nSpain's Jon Rahm is threatening to rush for gold in Paris, opening up a four-stroke lead at 20-under par.\n\nRahm has shot 6 under for the day and his closest competitors at the moment are Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood at 16 under.

Germany has had similar results, besting Belgium by 14 to open the tournament and then claiming an 11-point win over Japan in its second Group C game.\n\nThe first set is all tied up at 3-3 in the men's singles gold medal match between Serbia's Novak Djokovic and Spain's Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic earned the first point and jumped out to a 2-1 lead before Alcaraz battled back to even the score.\n\nBrady Ellison will play for gold in Olympics archery\n\nBrady Ellison of the United States has moved on to the gold medal match in men's individual archery.\n\nEllison defeated Germany's Florian Unruh 7-3 in the semifinals to unofficially clinch his fifth career Olympics medal, but he's still searching for his first gold.\n\nEllison will take on No. 1 seed Kim Woojin of South Korea at around 8:45 a.m. ET.\n\nOlympics skeet shooting: Austen Smith moves on to final\n\nAusten Smith advanced to the women's skeet final by finishing first in qualifying with 122 points. Smith turned in three perfect rounds and missed three clay disks out of 125 total - two in the second round and one in the fifth.

Matsuyama has been especially good so far Sunday, shooting 4 under through six holes.\n\nNovak Djokovic vs. Carlos Alcaraz for Olympic gold medal\n\nIn a rematch of the men's final at Wimbledon, staged less than a month ago, Serbia's Novak Djokovic will get a chance at revenge against Spain's Carlos Alcarez.\n\nDjokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam champion, is taking aim at winning the \"Golden Slam,\" which encompasses all four Grand Slam titles and an Olympic gold medal. Steffi Graff, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams are in the exclusive club.\n\nFreddie Crittenden jogs through preliminary heat for 110m hurdles\n\nTeam USA's Freddie Crittenden jogged through a preliminary men's 110-meter hurdles round Sunday to finish with a time of 18.27 at the Paris Olympics, nearly five full seconds behind heat winner Louis Francois Mendy of Senegal.\n\nWhy? Strategy. And misfortune.\n\nCrittenden came up with a minor physical issue Saturday - so minor, in fact, he wouldn't even describe it as an injury - but it was enough to give him concern that it might cause an injury. So in order to save his body and give himself the best chance of recovery, he willfully finished last with a plan of taking the next two days to rest, then hopefully rebound to medal contention in Tuesday's repechage round. -- Chase Goodbread\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone opens up with easy victory in 400 hurdles\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Sunday was just another day at the park for 400-meter hurdles world-record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone ran a 53.60 like it was an afternoon stroll.

Martinelli\n\nAthletes can't stop talking about food at Olympic Village\n\nPARIS -- The food being served athletes at the Paris Games has remained a popular topic through the first week of competition. It all goes back to criticism -- \"Muffin Man\" notwithstanding -- that made headlines prior to the opening ceremony.\n\nSimone Biles was even asked about the food after the U.S. women's gymnastics team's gold medal victory Tuesday night. And Biles gave a thumbs down, saying it wasn't \"proper French cuisine.\" -- Gentry Estes\n\nParis street artists express their feelings about Olympics\n\nPARIS -- It's hard to visit Paris and not be inspired - or at least appreciative - of the rich history that lives throughout the city. With the Olympics underway in Paris, street artists have used their art to express their feelings on the Games. \"Javelin is with bread,\" says Eludut, \"Swimming is swimming through trash.\" --

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nPARIS -- Novak Djokovic is used to winning on tennis's biggest stages.\n\nHe's the all-time leader for most Grand Slam men's singles titles (24). He's just one of three men to hold all four Grand Slam championships simultaneously. When he won the French Open last year, he became the first man to win each Grand Slam event -- the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open -- at least three times.\n\nBut at 37, there was one elusive title that escaped him during his long and glorious career: Olympic champion.\n\nThat drought ended Sunday at famed Roland-Garros stadium where the number-two ranked player has had had so much success before. In straight sets (both won in a tiebreak), Djokovic ended the match when he swatted a forehand winner against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz. The crowd erupted.\n\nThe righthander, who started playing tennis when he was four and turned professional more than two decades ago in 2003, shook hands with Alcaraz and then fell down on the red clay court. On all fours, he began sobbing and shaking. It was a surprising amount of emotion from someone who rarely shows it.\n\nThis tennis superstar who has winning records against the greats like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, and who had won so much in his career now had the one title that eluded him for far too long: an Olympic gold medal. He'd won a bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. But the last thing missing from an otherworldly tennis resume had escaped him.\n\nAgainst the young Spaniard who won the French Open on this same court in June and who beat the Serbian last month at Wimbledon to claim his fourth grand slam, the victory here in Paris meant something to Djokovic.\n\nHe came achingly close at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 when he attempted to do something no man had done before: claim the 'Golden' Slam. That's winning all four Grand Slam tournaments and an Olympic gold medal in a single year. Under pressure to do the unbelievable, he came up short, losing in the semifinals.\n\nIn Paris, none of the past mattered. Djokovic was golden.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_lewis@npr.org", "name": "Russell Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4374x2460+0+99/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2Fe2%2F7a5f85ed4f55979ff2f93f0e5b26%2Fgettyimages-2164812429.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The 37-year-old overcame his Spanish rival in straight sets 7-6 (3) 7-6 (2) in just under three hours of brutal clay court tennis on Court Phillippe-Chatrier. It was the completion of the missing blue tick on his CV, ending 16 years of hurt - including three semi-final Olympic losses -to claim gold.\n\nDjokovic had visually been stunned by the manner of his defeat at Wimbledon to the same opponent. The return fixture was more like the rebirth of the cyborg brand of qualities he is known for; incredible metal (and mental) strength, clean hitting and the ability to go into tunnel vision mode when facing severe headwinds from the other side of the net.\n\nOn Centre Court Sunday three weeks ago, the Serb was two sets down after 77 minutes. Here, the first five games alone took 36. He wasn't going anywhere, nudging ahead constantly on the scoreboard despite being blitzed at times by the thunderbolts from Alcaraz's toy-like turbo wind-ups. Both men were in good spirits but also showed huge signs of frustration when shots went astray. This meant more.\n\nThe opening act finally ended after 93 minutes with a Djokovic stop volley at the net in a tiebreak that he won 7-3. Both men refused to be broken during the 24 games outside of the shootouts despite multiple chances. It was the Spaniard who looked world weary against a wall of total defiance, especially in the marathon 15-minute ninth game of the first set when he missed five chances to grab the advantage.\n\nThe second set saw Djokovic raise his game, having stoked the furnace by winning the opener. He now had total focus, cranking up the pressure with that extra comfort of scoreboard pressure. Alcaraz's service games were less secure, although he came on strong at the back end to set up tiebreak 2. An incredible Djokovic return from an explosive Alcaraz forehand at 2-2 was too much to bear for the Spaniard. He won no further points in the breaker to cede the match. There was simply nothing left to give from either man. Despite the bare facts of a straight sets win, the jeopardy was compelling.\n\nIf this had been a five-setter, Alcaraz would have still very much fancied the job, but the sprint format of three (which these two have a habit of extending into Marvel epics) favored the older man. Djokovic was in an unrelenting mood, the kind that eventually wears down a rival, even a 21-year-old who is threatening to burst the dam of records over the next decade. The only water that was falling were the tears of joy from the winner immediately after the match. The loser couldn't speak, It was Iga Swiatek all over again.\n\nThis was the No. 1 seed's final shot at the highest point of the Olympiad podium. The cumulative progress of a career that has seen so many highs but constant lows in 2024 elevated the importance of this contest. Djokovic claimed a bronze at Beijing in 2008, but the rematch with the Spaniard was perfectly pitched. He had done his homework on what went wrong at SW19 and was hitting the ball much cleaner. The main concern was to keep Alcaraz's forehand from pounding his forecourt, especially with the knee brace that impoverished his fitness and movement after the meniscus operation in June.\n\n\"I'm still in shock. I put my heart, my soul, my body, my family, my everything on the line to win Olympic gold at age 37. I've finally done it,\" an ecstatic and exhausted Djokovic said afterwards. Alcaraz put his head in his hands at the end, trying to work out how a man he dismantled so clinically had come back with the answers. Again. The 21-year-old was disconsolate as he had been after the Cincinnati Open loss when the Serb rose up from the disappointment of the 2023 Wimbledon final to wreak revenge.\n\nDjokovic said that Alcaraz just keeps coming. After this exhilarating contest between the two biggest stars in men's tennis, the Murcia man must be thinking the same. It could happen all again in New York next month. The episodes are running out but there's still enough fire in the oldest Olympic singles champion since 1988 to keep the sequels of the highest quality.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reincarnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyborg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Blitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murcia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murcia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Murcia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66afd89d455290bb81e16d01/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The 37-year-old Serbian's victory marks the completion of the career Golden Slam -- a feat achieved by only five players in the history of tennis. Djokovic's triumph comes after a string of near misses in previous Olympics and completes his illustrious career that already includes a record 24 Grand Slam titles.\n\nThe final showcased an epic clash between two generations of tennis greatness. Alcaraz, the 21-year-old Spanish sensation, entered the match fresh off victories at the French Open and Wimbledon, while Djokovic was looking to avenge his recent Wimbledon defeat to Alcaraz and secure the elusive Olympic gold that had evaded him throughout his career. The match, which lasted nearly three hours, was a gripping contest filled with high-quality tennis and dramatic moments.\n\nRead More: Men beating up women at Olympics is 'madness' - Serbian president\n\nDespite concerns over his fitness due to a recent knee surgery, Djokovic demonstrated resilience and precision throughout the match. Both players held serve throughout the two sets, leading to tiebreaks in each. Djokovic's ability to elevate his game in crucial moments was evident, as he seized both tiebreaks with stunning shots and strategic play. The final point, a breathtaking forehand winner, sealed Djokovic's victory and his place in tennis history.\n\nThe final was a rematch of their recent Wimbledon encounter, and the tension was palpable as Djokovic and Alcaraz faced off once again. Alcaraz, known for his dynamic play and relentless energy, struggled to break Djokovic's serve, despite having multiple break point opportunities. Djokovic's serve-and-volley tactics and defensive prowess kept Alcaraz at bay, ultimately proving decisive in the tiebreaks.\n\nThe match was characterized by its clean play and minimal unforced errors from both players. The Olympic format, featuring best-of-three sets, added an extra layer of intensity, with each point and game carrying significant weight. The crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier was treated to a thrilling spectacle, with chants of \"No-le! No-le!\" and \"Car-los!

The Serbian champion won the gold medal at the Paris Olympics and also realized his greatest dream, which had always eluded him in previous editions.\n\nFew people imagined such a feat from Nole, who is 37 years old and was certainly not playing the best season of his career. Before the Paris Olympics, the former world number 1 had suffered several surprising defeats and struggled to find the right stimuli. Also, the rise of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner seemed to have put him in the background in the most important tournaments.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion played an absolutely fantastic match yesterday, beating a 16-year-old opponent and shocking the world for the umpteenth time. Novak won this medal for Serbia, as he admitted during the press conference. After the award ceremony, the Serb went to the Olympic village and celebrated with dancing together with other Serbian athletes. Djokovic gave a lesson to Alcaraz, who had come out on the court convinced that he would bring the gold medal to Spain and perhaps too confident. The Spaniard played a really good match, but he could not do anything against a Novak in deluxe version.\n\nNovak Djokovic burst into tears after winning the gold medal at the Paris Olympics and all sports fans were thrilled watching his feat.\n\nSpeaking with RMC, former WTA star and top analyst Marion Bartoli paid tribute to Nole: \"I've never seen Novak Djokovic so moved as today. It's a legendary moment for our sport, one that will never be forgotten. He's at the top, there won't be anyone to catch him. He has absolutely everything. He does it in front of his wife, his children, with the Serbian flag. He was in an absolutely exceptional degree of emotion. We've had a moment of history, I have tears in my eyes. Nole trembled when he was kneeling on the central of Roland Garros. This central was often difficult for him, where he suffered cruel defeats against Rafael Nadal. Carlos Alcaraz is the successor of Rafa and as a wink from history he wins against Carlitos at Roland Garros.\"\n\nDjokovic has pursued this dream throughout his career and never gave up, despite the painful disappointments he suffered at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2021. \"I still want to play in Los Angeles,\" he said during the press conference. \"I enjoy playing for my country and the Olympic Games particularly and Davis Cup, being part of the team.\n\nOlympic Games come every four years so the opportunity to win gold for your country is very rare and I knew the fact that I'm 37 and I don't know how many more chances I'll have, I knew everything. I have to deal with that, I have to try to silence all the noise around me and focus on what needs to be done on the court. And that's the biggest battle to win. I'm super thrilled that I managed to do it here in the way that I did it, against a guy who is the best in the world at the moment. I'm just over the moon. Everything that I felt in that moment when I won really surpassed everything I thought or hoped that it would. I thought that carrying the flag at the opening ceremony (in London) was the best feeling ever until I experienced this today.\"\n\nThe former world number one will be 41 in 2028, when the Los Angeles Olympics take place. Novak has shocked the world many times, but we will hardly see him participating in the next Olympics. The next goal of the Serbian will be the US Open at the end of August, where he will try to win his 25th Major.\n\nIn a long interview with Tennis Majors, Goran Ivanisevic praised Djokovic: \"We spoke about it so many times, it was one of my greatest wishes for him, he wanted it badly and that's why it was so emotional for everyone. Fascinating. It is an amazing switch he was able to make in his mind, Wimbledon was only two-three weeks ago,\" he said. \"The will, the desire, the strength... Alcaraz is 16 years younger, hits harder and is quicker, but Novak made it look like Carlos isn't younger, quicker and doesn't hit harder.\" Having shared the stage with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer for many years, Djokovic has proven to be the best ever. The 37-year-old from Belgrade has gone beyond the limits of logic and brought tennis to a new dimension.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simone_brugnoli@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Simone Brugnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Bartoli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marion Bartoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goran_Ivani\u0161evi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image152210.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Then, after an embrace with Alcaraz, he dropped to his knees in exhaustion and emotion and stayed down for nearly a minute. Then he went into the stands, embracing his team and family.\n\nEven for a man with 24 Grand Slam titles and nearly every significant record in the sport, this is the crowning achievement that he has long sought. Because this one wasn't just for himself, it was for his beloved Serbia.\n\nAfter gutting defeats in Rio and Tokyo, Djokovic wanted this badly. Even built his year around it. But after injuring his knee during the French Open and having meniscus surgery, it was unclear whether he would even be healthy enough to play the Olympics.\n\nBut Djokovic managed to return in time for Wimbledon, getting to the finals before Alcaraz crushed him in three sets.\n\nThis one was tightly played throughout, with no breaks of serve on either side. In the end, Djokovic was better in both tiebreakers. - Dan Wolken\n\nOlympic golf: Scottie Scheffler blazes to top of leaderboard\n\nThanks to three straight birdies, American golfer Scottie Scheffler is 8-under on the day and now has a share of the lead in the Olympic golf tournament.

Ellison went second, and his arrow was only slightly outside of his opponent's arrow, which had landed on the line to score a 10.\n\nEllison, a 35-year-old from Arizona who's a world-record holder and considered one of the sport's all-time best, won three consecutive matches Sunday to reach the gold medal final. -- Gentry Estes\n\nJon Rahm gets to 20 under in Olympic men's golf final\n\nSpain's Jon Rahm is threatening to rush for gold in Paris, opening up a four-stroke lead at 20-under par.\n\nRahm has shot 6 under for the day and his closest competitors at the moment are Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood at 16 under.

Germany has had similar results, besting Belgium by 14 to open the tournament and then claiming an 11-point win over Japan in its second Group C game.\n\nThe first set is all tied up at 3-3 in the men's singles gold medal match between Serbia's Novak Djokovic and Spain's Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic earned the first point and jumped out to a 2-1 lead before Alcaraz battled back to even the score.\n\nBrady Ellison will play for gold in Olympics archery\n\nBrady Ellison of the United States has moved on to the gold medal match in men's individual archery.\n\nEllison defeated Germany's Florian Unruh 7-3 in the semifinals to unofficially clinch his fifth career Olympics medal, but he's still searching for his first gold.\n\nEllison will take on No. 1 seed Kim Woojin of South Korea at around 8:45 a.m. ET.\n\nOlympics skeet shooting: Austen Smith moves on to final\n\nAusten Smith advanced to the women's skeet final by finishing first in qualifying with 122 points.

Matsuyama has been especially good so far Sunday, shooting 4 under through six holes.\n\nNovak Djokovic vs. Carlos Alcaraz for Olympic gold medal\n\nIn a rematch of the men's final at Wimbledon, staged less than a month ago, Serbia's Novak Djokovic will get a chance at revenge against Spain's Carlos Alcarez.\n\nDjokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam champion, is taking aim at winning the \"Golden Slam,\" which encompasses all four Grand Slam titles and an Olympic gold medal. Steffi Graff, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams are in the exclusive club.\n\nFreddie Crittenden jogs through preliminary heat for 110m hurdles\n\nTeam USA's Freddie Crittenden jogged through a preliminary men's 110-meter hurdles round Sunday to finish with a time of 18.27 at the Paris Olympics, nearly five full seconds behind heat winner Louis Francois Mendy of Senegal.\n\nWhy? Strategy. And misfortune.\n\nCrittenden came up with a minor physical issue Saturday - so minor, in fact, he wouldn't even describe it as an injury - but it was enough to give him concern that it might cause an injury. So in order to save his body and give himself the best chance of recovery, he willfully finished last with a plan of taking the next two days to rest, then hopefully rebound to medal contention in Tuesday's repechage round. -- Chase Goodbread\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone opens up with easy victory in 400 hurdles\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Sunday was just another day at the park for 400-meter hurdles world-record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone ran a 53.60 like it was an afternoon stroll. She won her fifth and final heat by nearly three seconds. Morocco's Noura Ennadi placed second at 55.26.\n\n\"It's good to shake the rust off. I haven't raced since U.S. trials,\" McLaughlin-Levrone said. \"I feel good. The track is pretty fast ... It feels good to get back out there and compete.\"\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is defending her Olympic title in Paris. Her main competitor is expected to be Netherlands' Femke Bol who won her third heat, running a 53.38.\n\nThe world-record holder and defending Olympic champ was voted a U.S. track and field co-captain before the start of the track and field competition.\n\n\"Honor to have that role. I know Allyson (Felix) had that last time,\" McLaughlin-Levrone said. \"It's just great that my peers respect me as a competitor. I'm just hoping to represent Team USA the best I can.\"\n\nSundays always bring out the best golf in the world's best golfers. That's no different at the Olympics.\n\nAmerican star and Masters winner Scottie Scheffler is at 3-under par after five holes to get to 13 under for the tournament and within three shots of the lead -- which is held by Spain's Jon Rahm and Team USA teammate and defending Olympics gold medalist Xander Schauffele.\n\nGrant Holloway dominates first round of 110 hurdles\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Grant Holloway looks destined for a gold medal in Paris.\n\nHolloway ran smooth over 10 hurdles in the opening round and crossed the finish line at 13.01 to win the fifth heat in the 110-meter hurdles.

But instead, Christiansen is the unofficial Muffin Man of the Paris Games, thanks to his numerous TikToks showcasing his love for the chocolate muffins in the Olympic Village. -- Michelle R. Martinelli\n\nAthletes can't stop talking about food at Olympic Village\n\nPARIS -- The food being served athletes at the Paris Games has remained a popular topic through the first week of competition.

He has won each of the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open at least three times, but Olympic glory had eluded him as he headed to Roland Garros for the Paris Olympics\n\nAn epic first set went the distance, with Djokovic taking it on a tie-break after more than 90 minutes of play. Both players dug deep to avoid being broken, and that pattern continued well into set number two for what felt like an inevitable second tie-break, where the 37-year-old sealed the deal.\n\nThe stakes were high for both men going into the final at Roland Garros. Djokovic knew he could wrap up a career golden slam with victory, while a win for Alcaraz would continue his recent dominance over the Serb, and in the end it was the veteran who came out on top.\n\nDjokovic went into the tournament as top seed, and justified that with some dominant displays. He didn't drop a single set en route to the final as he overcame Matt Ebden, Rafael Nadal, Dominik Koepfer, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Lorenzo Musettin.\n\nAlcaraz, the second seed, was similarly comfortable. None of Hady Habib, Tallon Griekspoor, Roman Safiullin, Tommy Paul nor Felix Auger-Aliassime was able to take a set off the Spaniard, with Auger-Aliassime blown away 6-1, 6-1 in the semis.\n\nSomething had to give in the final, though. Alcaraz was the first of the pair to surrender a set, with Djokovic taking that first tie-break, and the veteran clinched a 7-6, 7-6 victory in a match of the highest quality.\n\nShare your thoughts on the men's final in the comments section\n\nEarlier, Musetti had beaten Auger-Aliassime in the bronze medal match. The Italian won 6-4, 1-6, 6-3, following up his Wimbledon semi-final run with another run to the final four.\n\nIt was Italy's first Olympic medal in tennis since the sport returned to the programme in 1988. \"I've been eating plain pasta and chicken for three months, basically, so I think eating a pizza is the least I can do tonight!\" Musetti said after earning bronze.\n\nIn the women's singles, Zheng Qinwen of China beat Donna Vekic in the final to win gold, while Iga Swiatek won bronze. There were also golds for Australia in the men's doubles and Czech Republic in the mixed doubles, while the women's doubles final pits Italy's third seeds against Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider, who are competing in Paris as individual neutral athletes.\n\nFollow all the action from the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Every major race was on it. This is what the exceptional desire. Every box ticked, every record rewritten, every rival conquered. Greatness in sport is a kind of acceptable greed. It is a constant craving for more.\n\nIt is how Novak Djokovic has brilliantly lived. Everything with him is a record. The 24 Grand Slam singles titles. The 40 ATP Masters 1000s. The eight times as year-end No.1.\n\nBut no Olympic gold.\n\nAnd then on an afternoon in Roland Garros so rugged, so breathtaking and lung-busting, so intense that it made both men weep, Djokovic finally won the Olympic final against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-2) in two hours and 50 minutes. He cried in his towel, waved his flag and went into the stands to find his people. You might think he has had enough of Spaniards on this court.\n\nIt's been a rough season for the Serb. Grand Slams eluded him and injury visited. People wondered if he was at pensionable age and spoke of torches being passed and it must have burnt. But perhaps it's exactly what a proud athlete required. A cause to hold tight, a world to defy.\n\nBefore the day's play began, French tennis star Yannick Noah appeared with a stick in his hand and thumped the ground thrice. This ritual, frequent at the Olympics, is inspired by French theatre. It symbolises the start of a performance and asks the audience for its attentiveness. But on this Sunday they immediately had the audience's attention. Both men, 3-3 in head-to-head meetings, arrived wearing the same colour as the shale court. This was red as fire and as warning.\n\nIn the fourth game, the Spaniard fell to 0-40 but used his nerve to extricate himself. In the fifth game, the Serb was down break point thrice and relied on his serve to save him. In the Olympic programme, one of the two venues set aside for boxing is Stade Roland Garros. Certainly for a while this court felt like a ring with two pummelling practitioners.\n\nDjokovic waved his arms in frustration. Alcaraz put his hands on his hips in disbelief. Their body language spoke of the heat of the scrap. The ninth game unspooled as a masterpiece of tension and in hindsight the match turned here. It stretched 18 points, with five break points for Alcaraz, but Djokovic held. He resembled an old, gnarled oak who would take some cutting down.\n\nThe effort of their art was clear on the canvas, for the court was a mess of scars from sliding feet. At 6-5, Djokovic had a set point, only for Alcaraz to hit a forehand winner. This wasn't a match but an interrogation. Then finally in the tie-breaker, the Serb prevailed, sealing it with an athletic forehand stretch volley after 93 minutes. He hadn't shaved for days but his game started to look razor sharp.\n\nOn a balcony fine fellows wielding a trumpet, saxophone and drums belted out music. Below them these two fellows produced an unforgettable concert. Third game of the second set, the Spaniard shanked a forehand long to be down break point. Trouble? Next point he saved it with a whipping forehand winner.\n\nBut the 37-year-old Djokovic started to look like the old Djokovic. That brilliant bully who used to play with a set square. The not-missing geometrician with a game of precision and calculation. He was even hectoring his box which is often a fine sign. He looked involved, Alcaraz animated.\n\nAccording to the Spanish law of on-court manners set down by Rafael Nadal, you don't throw your racket. After an awry backhand in the eighth game, you could tell Alcaraz wanted to break that rule. He didn't, of course, for everything in this match was about control. Of pace, spin, nerves, temperament.\n\nDjokovic chased a lob down, a figure of dedicated desperation, trying to make Alcaraz play an extra shot. The Serb was on the baseline, the Spaniard behind. They are separated by 16 years and you can read it how you want: the Spaniard has 16 years less of worn tissue, the Serb has 16 years more of experience.\n\nIt showed in the second tie-breaker. From his memory the Serb produced two forehands on the dead run of ferocious quality. They were the greatest shots of the day from the greatest player in the game. Alcaraz, deflated, fell to error. And Djokovic just fell to his knees in thanks.\n\nTennis is one of the original nine Olympics sports from 1896 and the first gold was won by a man who went into Irish politics.

Neither player could break the other's serve, with the Serbian star ultimately securing both set tiebreakers with ease, earning his first Olympic gold and his second Olympic medal overall.", "source": {"uri": "timesnownews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TimesNow"}, "authors": [{"uri": "debayan_bhattacharyya@timesnownews.com", "name": "Debayan Bhattacharyya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-112270354,thumbsize-28458,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/112270354.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 186, "textEnd": 194}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

In a vintage performance of brutal, precise shotmaking and the perfect combination of resolute defence and calculated aggression, he defeated Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning Roland Garros and Wimbledon champion, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) to win the gold medal at the Paris Olympics - the one tennis achievement that has evaded a resume that contains 24 Majors, all nine Masters 1000 titles, and triumphs at the ATP Finals and Davis Cup.\n\nAs the top seed and most legendary presence on the tour, that may not come as a total surprise. But to put the achievement, given where his tennis has been over the last year, in context; to understand why he defies all convention as a tennis champion, go back to his favourite proverb.\n\nSome time around last year, Djokovic's shoes became a bit too comfortable. The Serb won three of the four Majors in 2023 and reached all four finals. He ended all debate by becoming the outright leader in the all-time Grand Slam leaderboard, winning at least three titles at each of the four tournaments. After reaching the highest of highs, the burning fire began to flicker.\n\nA few pesky pebbles would make it into his boots over the next six months. After a sluggish start to 2024, recovery from a knee injury, and subsequent surgery, a few weeks prior to Wimbledon may have been a big hurdle, but he responded by reaching the final. Humiliation from a 16-years-younger challenger in the summit clash may have fuelled all sorts of uncertainty, but Djokovic found a new source of motivation to thrive on.\n\nAdversity into steel\n\nFew players, if any, have shared Djokovic's aptitude of turning adversity into steel. The begrudgingly polite Parisian crowds would witness every bit of that aptitude this past week.\n\nAfter winning four Majors, including the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back, Alcaraz's star has risen at a pace faster than the hefty expectations that have followed him ever since he became a teenaged World No. 1. On Sunday, he was not even mildly off the pace, but on an intense, high-wired afternoon, Djokovic found his very best at the crucial moments, and typically found another gear to go to in the two tiebreakers, to outplay him for the win.\n\nThis was an enthralling baseline contest; the first set alone lasted nearly 100 minutes. Unlike the beleaguered straight-sets loss at Wimbledon a month ago, Djokovic went toe-to-toe with Alcaraz from the baseline even when the Spaniard was finding big mileage behind his forehand and moving with speed to cover all corners of the court.\n\nBoth players failed to blink - Alcaraz saved five break points and Djokovic saved eight - but it was the mammoth ninth game of the first set in which Djokovic raised his level, saving five break points, and never looked back. As it went to a breaker, Djokovic locked down and Alcaraz let his level fall just enough for the Serb to take advantage.\n\nNeither player let their levels fall too much in the second, even as the Spaniard faced a mountain to climb. A few fascinating, intense exchanges followed and a second breaker ensued in which Alcaraz raised his baseline game only for Djokovic to up the ante further and slap a few huge groundstrokes and see out the win.\n\nUltimately, the precision of Djokovic's racquet - the pinpoint T-serves, the lunging forehand winners, the error-free tiebreakers - propelled him to a deserved win.\n\nThat same vague parlour debate may be triggered once again, a presumption that it had been put to bed last year itself would have been fair. But by finding his best tennis against the best player in the world to win the one title that has eluded him, there could be no louder statement of intent from Djokovic that he still belongs at the top of the pile in men's tennis - even if he is competing with those closer to his children's age than his. Especially when history is on the line.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "namit_kumar@indianexpress.com", "name": "Namit Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/IE-OGimage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Are you not entertained?\n\nDjokovic comes into this match having dominated all would-be contenders, including beating Alcaraz's doubles teammate and fading legend Rafael Nadal.\n\nHe began the tournament against Matthew Ebden, dispatching the Australian in straight sets and only dropping a single game. Ebden won gold in the men's doubles yesterday in a tie-break which ended 10-8.\n\nIn the second round, he took on Nadal, again winning in two sets.

The Spanish stalwart is in the twilight of his career and Djokovic was able to make easy work of this one. Sadly, it's likely to be the last.\n\nAfter beating the German Dominik Koepfer and the Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas respectively, he faced Lorenzo Musetti in the semi-finals.\n\nSpeaking after his victory, the one-time Olympic medalist said, \"It was such a tense match, there were a lot of emotions, so much expectations and stress particularly as a win meant I would secure a medal for my country and it's my first Olympic final. I'm thrilled.\n\n\"I was very nervous before the match because I lost three out of four of my semi-finals in the Olympic Games, so I really wanted to get over this hurdle.\n\n\"I lost quite comfortably to Carlos [Alcaraz] at Wimbledon but this is a different surface and I'm playing better and moving better than I was at Wimbledon, and in a way I have nothing to lose as I already have a medal, so I'm going to go for it.\"\n\nHe faces the stiffest of challenges in his first Olympic finals in Carlos Alcaraz who already holds the past two Wimbledon finals over his head.\n\nAlcaraz has dominated on his way to the finals, juggling playing doubles with Nadal at the same time.

Until next time, amigo,\" Djokovic wrote on X.\n\nThe final, a tightly contested match between the world's top two players, ended with a scoreline of 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) in favour of Djokovic.\n\nDespite a 16-year age difference, Djokovic demonstrated his experience and resilience, overcoming the challenge posed by the rising star, Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic's victory at the Olympics follows a period of relative underperformance earlier in the year, making the triumph particularly noteworthy.\n\nHis emotional reaction upon winning, visibly shaken and lying on the court, revealed the profound significance of the victory for the Serbian champion.\n\nDespite the loss, Alcaraz, at 20 years old, is widely regarded as one of the most promising talents in tennis. His performance at the Olympics further solidified this perception, showcasing his potential to dominate the sport in the future.\n\nWith 24 Grand Slam titles, numerous Masters 1000 titles, and now an Olympic gold medal, Djokovic's achievements speak for themselves, placing him firmly in the pantheon of tennis legends.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Alcaraz responded to one in his first service game by pouring in an ace followed by a beautiful drop shot.\n\nIn his next service game he fell behind 0-40 before fighting off all three break points to stay on serve. Then with the first set tied, 2-2, Djokovic was the one with a timely response, rallying from 0-40 to eventually secure the game.\n\nWith the first set tied, 4-4, this duo submitted one of the most riveting games of this sparkling rivalry. There were constant swings during the 18-point game. Alcaraz pumped both fists and roared when he secured a break point of the game with a powerful backhand down the line. But Djokovic turned back that break opportunity for Alcaraz as well as five others in the game.\n\nBut the marathon finally ended with Djokovic finding a way on the 18th and final point, and the crowd rose to its feet in appreciation of a stunning sequence.\n\nDjokovic led, 6-5, when he lined up the first set point of the opening set. But Alcaraz was predictably unfazed, winning the next three to force a tiebreak.\n\nWith the tiebreak tied, 3-3, Djokovic finally created some separation during this tense and taut set, rolling off four points in a row and storming to the net to drop in a winner on his first set point, pumping his fist as he walked away after a marathon 93-minute opening set.\n\nAlcaraz seemed slightly less comfortable early in the second set, perhaps frustrated by his missed opportunities in the first and the realization that he had just two sets to rectify things.\n\nBut he is far too talented to crumble. He pushed away break point in his second service game, and in his third he shook off an early 30-15 deficit thanks to a beautiful rally at the net that ended with a well-placed ball near the sideline and a pump of the fist.\n\nHe tried to build on that momentum with a strong net finish the following game, putting his right hand to his ear to persuade the crowd to get even louder. But Djokovic had an answer, just as he did for most of the afternoon. He finished off the game and held his racket in the air, the second set knotted at 3.\n\nAt 4-all, Djokovic rallied from 40-0 to force deuce. A lengthy and pivotal groundstroke rally finally ended when both players moved to the net, with Alcaraz regaining control with a powerful forehand down the line. He put his hand to his ear once again while Djokovic bent over with his hands on his knees for several moments. Alcaraz won the game, but Djokovic was unbowed, eventually forcing another tiebreak.\n\nDjokovic started with a sweeping forehand that gave him a mini-break, then took a 2-0 lead on his serve when he saved a potential winner by Alcaraz by dropping a lob shot onto the end line and eventually won the point.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lob (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/sULBHf79KH8m8saAsEZa4tTGfHI=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/U2FE45Z52RJHFO3EVUG7JIEH3M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Paris Olympics - in particular the Philippe Chatrier of the Roland Garros Stadium - will be the dream backdrop for the stellar challenge between the Serbian champion and the young Carlos Alcaraz, ruler of this part of the season. A challenge that promises sparks and that, in one sense or another, will rewrite the history of tennis.\n\nAt the press conference he took part in after the victory in two sets in the semifinal against Lorenzo Musetti, the Serbian superstar analyzed his next match with great lucidity and admitted that Alcaraz will be the favorite for everything he has achieved in recent weeks. Djokovic has of course reiterated that he will give his all to win the gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\n\"I don't consider myself the favorite on Sunday, because Alcaraz has proven that he is the best player in the world right now. He won Roland Garros and Wimbledon, where he beat me in the final quite clearly. He reached the final here in Paris without dropping a set. I mean, I did it too, but I think the way he is playing, he is definitely the favorite.

Having achieved everything else on his legendary resume, winning gold in tennis singles for Serbia was Djokovic's last real tally to say he had done everything.\n\nThat's right, folks. Djokovic can also finally say he has managed the career Golden Slam -- winning every major Grand Slam and Olympic gold.\n\nAnd it's no small thing that he was able to beat the person who humiliated him at Wimbledon only a few weeks earlier.\n\nLook at the sheer unfiltered joy on that man's face.

There is now not a tournament of note that Djokovic has not won.\n\nUntil this week, his Olympic reward for a lifetime of effort had been one bronze medal won back in 2008 in Beijing. He had never come close to the gold medal before - this was his first Olympic final.\n\nSo when, at last, he put away Carlos Alcaraz 7-6, 7-6, he fell to his knees and sobbed like a baby. He stood and gave thanks to the heavens, still blubbing, and then collapsed in his chair and howled into his towel. He could not stop.\n\nThe poor ball girl holding a neatly folded Serbia flag didn't know what to do. She had been told to give him the flag but here she was standing beside a grown man in floods of tears. She looked slightly panic stricken: Djokovic was temporarily lost in his own world. After what must have seemed like an eternity to that ball girl, he mopped his eyes and took the flag and held it up to the Serbian fans before running off to celebrate with his team and his family.\n\nHe knew this was his last chance to win gold. He will be 41 by the time the next Olympics come around and will, in all probability, be long retired by then. But to claim it, he had to get past the French Open and Wimbledon champion, the man who had given him a lesson in winning big finals just three weeks ago.\n\nThe final was the match the Olympic tennis tournament had been crying out for. In truth, it had been a pretty nondescript event until this point after a small herd of players withdrew at the eleventh hour through illness and injury. Add to that group the players who did not think the diversion back to red clay before the American hard court swing was worth the risk and the two singles fields looked pretty sparse.\n\nNo matter: Djokovic was a man on a mission. His problem was that Alcaraz was on a similar mission. From the very start, it was clear that the 24-time Grand Slam champion was playing lights out simply to stay in contention while Alcaraz still had a couple of gears to go through to reach his peak. Yet it came down to determination and steely focus: Djokovic simply would not let go of his dream.\n\nAlcaraz was in turn brilliant, powerful, aggressive and wasteful. There were clumping winners from his forehand - the forehand that Djokovic was trying so hard to keep away from - and careless errors. And his serve was not behaving itself. He repelled all six of the break points he faced but could not convert any of the eight he manufactured on soon-to-be champion's serve. The longer it went on, the more the nerves and the frustrations showed.\n\nAt the other end of the court, Djokovic looked like a spring coiled so tightly that it may snap at any moment. Somehow, he held himself together to take the first set and from there, he dug in as only he can. If Alcaraz ran him ragged, he gulped in air and stood up to take more punishment. If Alcaraz showed him the merest sign of weakness, he pounced. And after two hours and 52 minutes, he was the Olympic champion. The tears could flow.\n\n\"I'm telling myself always that I am enough,\" he told NBC. \"Because I can be very self critical. I don't know. That's one of the biggest internal battles I keep on fighting with myself. That I feel like I haven't done enough or been enough in my life on and off the court. So it's a big lesson for me. I'm super grateful for the blessing to win a historic gold medal for my country. To complete the golden slam. To complete all the records.\"\n\nAnd then he was asked, \"is this enough?\". The reply could be read many different ways: \"I think so,\" he said. Who knows what the golden champion's future holds after this. He will either be the all-conquering super hero in New York or he will be utterly spent.\n\nThe Olympics marked the end of the careers of Andy Murray and Angie Kerber and it may have been the last time we see Nadal at Roland-Garros. After being crushed by Djokovic in the second round, Rafa sounded very dubious about his chances of making the US Open. He is signed up for the Laver Cup in Germany in September but with his fragile body held together by bandages and will power, he might not go much further than Berlin.\n\nAnd as a few passing thoughts on the Olympics in general, what was that mascot all about? Over the years, most of the Olympic mascots have been incomprehensible mish-mashes of PR and marketing gobbledegook and the French one was no different. The red blob that snuck into every camera angle was called, officially, a Phryge (no, we don't know how to pronounce it either).\n\nIt is based on the Phrygian cap or \"bonnet phrygien\" as worn by the French Revolutionaries in 1789. In other words, a red hat but one that represents the revolutionary spirit of libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9. But just as a camel was famously decribed by Sir Alec Issigonis as \"a horse designed by a committee\", the Olympic Phryge is neither hatlike nor revolutionary.\n\nIn concept, it is worthy and terribly French. But unless you happen to be French or well versed in French history, it resembles... how to put this delicately? Think of the poop emoji only in red. Nonetheless, it has been everywhere and it would seem that Phryges breed like rabbits. The BBC coverage was covered with the things and from having one or two in the main studio on day one, there was a whole family of them on the studio sofa come the start of the athletics programme: Mama and Papa Phryge with a host of little, baby Phrygelettes. They had been busy.\n\nRed blobs notwithstanding, the Paris Olympics has been a resounding success so far. The stands at all events have been packed, the crowds have been enthusiastic and - as they should be - partisan and everyone looks to be having a fabulous time.

At 21, Alcaraz is now the youngest to ever compete for an Olympic gold on the men's side while Djokovic, 37, is the oldest.\n\nThis will mark the seventh matchup between the two stars, and the first since Alcaraz beat Djokovic in straight sets to claim the Wimbledon title last month. Alcaraz has yet to drop a single set in the tournament.\n\nThe men's 100-meter final is set for Sunday afternoon, and American Noah Lyles is right in the mix for a medal despite a rough preliminary day on Saturday. Lyles finished his heat in second place which, while enough to move him into the semifinals, was his slowest run in more than a year.\n\nThe semifinals for the 100-meter will start at 2 p.m. ET, and if he makes it through the final will start just before 4 p.m.\n\nThe individual apparatus finals continue in gymnastics with the uneven bars. Suni Lee is the only American qualified for Sunday's final. She took bronze in the event at the Tokyo Olympics and will look to collect another medal in Paris.\n\nThe U.S. will have one last shot at trying to catch Australia in swimming golds in these Olympics. Australia swimmers enter the day with seven golds to USA's six.\n\nAmerican Gretchen Walsh will go for gold in the 50-meter freestyle, and the U.S. will also have a shot at winning both the men's and women's 4x100 medley relay races to cap the night.\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team will wrap up group play on Sunday with a matchup against Germany, which will also enter the matchup with a perfect 2-0 record so far in France. Team USA has already clinched a quarterfinal berth after they beat Belgium on Thursday, which marked their 57th consecutive Olympics win. That streak dates back to 1992.\n\nGermany has also secured a quarterfinals berth already, so Sunday's game isn't a must-win for either side. But with the win streak and seeding for the knockout stage on the line, a 3-0 start in pool play would be huge for the Americans on their quest to another gold medal.\n\nThe final round of the men's golf tournament kicks off on Sunday morning outside of Paris, and Xander Schauffele is in a great spot to defend his gold medal.\n\nThe reigning British Open winner holds a share of the lead with Spain's Jon Rahm at 14-under entering the final round. Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood will start just a shot back in third. Both Ireland's Rory McIroy and USA's Scottie Scheffler are within striking distance, too, though they'll start the day four shots back.\n\nThe final round will start at 3 a.m. ET and can be seen on the Golf Channel.\n\nAll events streaming live on Peacock and NBCOlympics.com.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Djokovic prevailed 7-6, 7-6 in Paris in a tight affair where the opening set lasted more than 90 minutes.\n\nThe 37-year-old cut an emotional figure after claiming the only title to elude him in tennis, having not lost a set in the competition. Djokovic also defeated Matt Ebden, Rafael Nadal, Dominik Koepfer, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Lorenzo Musetti on his way to the final\n\nThe 24-times grand slam winner might yet have more lofty ambitions, despite his advanced age. Djokovic has one eye on the next Olympics in four years time.\n\nThat provoked Serbia team captain and former world number 12 Troicki, to pop his head through the door. Djokovic's countryman could only laugh.\n\n\"Look, I still, I want to play in Los Angeles, said Djokovic. \"I enjoy playing for my country in Olympic Games particularly and Davis Cup. It's something that, being part of a team... [Troicki emerges]\n\n\"He's making fun of my calendar goals, playing in Los Angeles. I don't know if he's laughing because he thinks it's unrealistic or he's like, okay, another four years with this guy.\"\n\nDjokovic admitted that his Paris outing could be his last opportunity for success however. \"Olympic Games come every four years so the opportunity to win gold for your country is very rare and I knew the fact that I'm 37 and I don't know how many more chances I would have,\" he added.\n\nEven on this occasion, Djokovic knew it would be a difficult task. The Olympic champion new from the early stages of his time in France that he would earn the chance to play for gold\n\n\"I was ready for this tournament and I didn't drop a set [in the] entire tournament,\" he said. \"I knew already in the first opening two rounds the way I was playing that this is my chance. If it's ever going to be, it's going to be now.\n\n\"When I qualified for the finals I felt a big relief because that's the hurdle I wasn't able to surpass in the past. I did celebrate like I won the tournament but of course I wanted gold and I knew that it's going to take the highest mountain to climb at the moment, probably the highest one playing Alcaraz who is in incredible form.\"\n\nFollow all the action on day seven of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

In addition to the on-court earning, the veteran has signed numerous endorsement deals with world-renowned brands. Adidas sponsored the Serb for the majority his early professional life. The German company dropped Djoko in 2009 and replaced him with Andy Murray.\n\nMeanwhile companied like Lacoste, Asics, Head, NetJets, Peugeot, Raiffeisen Bank International, Ultimate Software Group and Hublot have business deals with him. These partnerships have played a huge role in boosting his net worth, as endorsement contracts are often multimillion-dollar deals reflecting his global influence and brand value.\n\nApart from this, he is also involved in his family's Serbian wine business, and has helped to launch two new wines in 2022. They are called Djokovic Syrah 2020 and Djokovic Chadronnay 2020. According to Sportico, Djokovic is second in the list of Highest-paid Tennis Players of 2024, with a total earnings of USD 38.7 million, only behind Alcaraz (USD 45 million).\n\nDjoko has wisely invested his money in various sectors, including real estate, buying properties in Marbella and Monte Carlo.

But I will be back stronger and learn from this.\"\n\nThe four-time Grand Slam champion said his tears after the match were because he felt like he \"let down Spain\", adding that the extra pressure of playing for the flag rather than himself had affected him at some crucial moments on Sunday.\n\nBut no one who has watched the passion the 21-year-old brought to his first Olympic tournament, in singles and doubles, alongside Rafa Nadal, could criticise him.\n\nCertainly not two-time Olympic gold-medallist Nadal.\n\n\"Carlos, although I know that today is a difficult day, appreciate a medal that is very important for the whole country,\" 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal said in an Instagram post. \"Thank you for this incredible week and for a medal that you give to Spanish sport.\"\n\nDespite having to settle for silver, Alcaraz said his first taste of the Olympics had been special.\n\n\"This has been a different week, it's not what we're used to. There's the Olympic village, all the athletes. You can watch other sports, you can root for Spain in different disciplines,\" he said. \"Tennis is usually very lonely, you're usually by yourself but this week I played with Rafa, my idol.\n\n\"I've learnt from him so it's been a wonderful week.

His emotional moment came after a thrilling three-hour battle against Spain's rising star, Carlos Alcaraz, at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe match, held on the iconic clay courts of Roland Garros on Sunday, was a testament to Djokovic's enduring skill and tenacity. In a dramatic display of tennis prowess, he triumphed in straight sets, 7-6(3), 7-6(2), marking the culmination of years of relentless pursuit.\n\nAs Djokovic clinched the final point, he erupted in celebration, but the real tears came when he sat down, hugging his parents and siblings as he processed the magnitude of his victory.\n\nSurrounded by a chorus of cheers from fans and the supportive embrace of his team, Djokovic's tears were a poignant reminder of his journey -- one marked by relentless dedication and passion. The Olympic gold medal, a prize that had long eluded him, now completed his extraordinary collection of titles, which includes all four Grand Slams, all ATP Masters, and the Davis Cup.\n\nFor Alcaraz, the final marked a different narrative. Despite his valiant effort and recent triumph over Djokovic at Wimbledon, the 21-year-old Spaniard had to settle for silver in his Olympic debut. The young star's future remains bright, as he continues to promise a new chapter in tennis.\n\nAs Djokovic savored his historic win, the tears of triumph spoke volumes about a career defined by perseverance and unmatched excellence.\n\nUNI BDN ARN", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miloslav_Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.uniindia.com/cms/gall_content/2024/8/2024_8$largeimg04_Aug_2024_220424883.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

He already had a record 400-plus weeks ranked No. 1. And now, at age 37, he collected the gold he desperately wanted, something Nadal (in singles in 2008 and doubles in 2016) and Federer (in doubles in 2008) had but Djokovic did not until Sunday's 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) victory over Carlos Alcaraz.\n\n\"Yes and no,\" is how Djokovic's answer began. \"Yes, it's complete, because I completed all the achievements with this gold medal. But no, because I love this sport. I don't play it only to win the tournament -- I play it because I really love competition. I love the drive, every day, every week, of training my body, perfecting my game, proving myself, still at this age.\"\n\nIt is surely a mistake to view every step Djokovic takes, every prize he wins, as a statement in the ongoing and unnecessary conversation about which member of the Big Three of men's tennis is the best of the bunch. Still, those debates carry on.\n\nWho can possibly say what comes next for Djokovic -- or Nadal or Alcaraz or women's singles gold medalist Zheng Qinwen of China or No. 1 Iga Swiatek, for that matter. With the U.S. Open starting in three weeks, and the need to shift from the clay at Roland Garros to the hard courts at Flushing Meadows, there's not much time for rest or reflection.\n\n\"I don't know about the future, to be honest. I really want ... a moment to celebrate,\" Djokovic said. \"It was a long journey. \"\n\nZheng Qinwen is the latest addition to the list of young tennis stars\n\nStill just 21, the same age as Alcaraz, Zheng became the first player from China to win an Olympic tennis singles gold.\n\nHer run to the Australian Open final in January marked her as someone to watch. So did her rise into the top 10. This will make her a big star at home and, if she stays on this trajectory, there should be more to come.\n\nSwiatek is just 23. Reigning U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff is 20. Add Zheng to the youth movement.\n\nHer strokes were always there, and now her mind is, too, she says. Zheng showed patience and toughness while ending Swiatek's 25-match winning streak at Roland Garros, eliminating her in the semifinals.\n\nAfter defeating Donna Vekic in the final Saturday, Zheng said she thinks she'll play more relaxed now that she's an Olympic champion. If so, look out.\n\n\"I still have a long way to go,\" she said, \"because winning a Grand Slam is always my dream.\"\n\nWill Rafael Nadal play in the U.S. Open?\n\nNadal is 38 and lost to Djokovic in the second round of singles play, after bowing out in the first round of this year's French Open, where he has won 14 of his 22 major titles. Nadal and Alcaraz generated a ton of buzz as an old-and-young doubles team before losing in the quarterfinals.\n\nAfter that defeat, Nadal was asked about playing in New York -- he was on the entry list released last month -- and paused for a while before responding.\n\n\"Looks like not. But I'm going to let you know soon,\" Nadal said. \"For me, now, I can't give you a clear answer. I need some time, but for me, (it) looks difficult.\"\n\nCoco Gauff heads back to the U.S. Open\n\nThe trip to the U.S. Open for Gauff will mark the one-year anniversary of a big occasion: She won her first Grand Slam title there in 2023.\n\nIt will be her first defense of a major championship, although she insists she does not see it as a \"defense,\" just an opportunity.\n\nGauff often speaks about taking lessons away from losses. It should be fascinating to watch her at Flushing Meadows after her Olympics experience, which included joining LeBron James as a U.S. flag bearer at the opening ceremony along the Seine River, an impromptu breakfast with Noah Lyles just days before he wound up winning the 100-meter dash at the track -- and early exits in singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles.\n\n\"I'll try to take the positive out of it,\" Gauff said, \"and do better next time.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Yet despite his disappointment at his defeat to Novak Djokovic in the gold-medal match on Court Philippe-Chatrier, the Olympic flame inside the Spaniard remains well and truly alight.\n\n\"I always want to win, that's for sure, but taking the silver medal, I have to be really proud,\" said Alcaraz in post-match comments made to NBC. \"I'm building a really great career and I hope it's going to keep going.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm pretty proud to be in this position, I'm pretty proud to bring a medal to Spain. I'm pretty sure that my moment will come, and I will bring the gold medal to Spain one day. So I'm going to wait for that moment and I'm going to work for that moment, but right now I have to enjoy lifting the silver medal, it's pretty amazing as well.\"\n\nAlcaraz has good reason to feel confident about the future. Sunday's loss was a rare low moment in what has otherwise been a largely stellar year for the Spaniard. He lifted his third and fourth major titles at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, respectively, while he also lifted his fifth ATP Masters 1000 crown in Indian Wells in March.\n\nThe No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings also knows how close he was to Djokovic in Sunday's high-level encounter. Alcaraz forced the Serbian to fend off eight break points en route to victory, and he will leave Paris satisfied he gave his all in pursuit of Olympic glory.\n\n'It is painful to lose the way that I lost this match. I had my opportunities... I couldn't take them,\" said Alcaraz. \"Novak is playing great, he really settled in his position, in the difficult moments he increased his level, he played unbelievable. I'm really disappointed but honestly, I'm going to leave the court with my head really high. I gave everything that I had fighting for Spain, it was everything to me so I'm proud the way that I played today.\"\n\nThe next few months also promise plenty for Alcaraz, who is currently 38-7 for the season and second in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. He is next set to compete at the Cincinnati Open later this month, when he will resume his pursuit of rival and current Live Race leader Jannik Sinner.

This [winning gold] supersedes everything. Representing my country has always been the greatest priority and honour for me.\"\n\nThe tears alone do not tell the story. Djokovic is not averse to shedding a tear on a tennis court, and his reaction was in keeping with this most lachrymose of Games, probably because this is the first Olympics with full stands since Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nAnd while the score was straight sets, the 7-6, 7-6 does not reflect the titanic effort required to overcome reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz, whom it took nearly three hours for Djokovic to dispatch.\n\nBut the magnitude of this final and what it meant to the two men, who both sobbed afterwards, will not change the fact that tennis is not a sport that belongs in the Olympic Games.\n\nAs he so often is, Djokovic is an outlier, rather than the norm.\n\n\"I don't play it only to win the tournament. I play it because I really love competition,\" Djokovic added.\n\n\"I love the drive, every day, every week of training my body, perfecting my game, improving myself still at this age.\"\n\nThis admirable pursuit of perfection is very much in the Olympic spirit. But the pursuit that dominates tennis - of money - is not.\n\nNow the amateur status of the Olympics is certainly fading. Its centrepiece sport athletics will pay each gold medallist $50,000 (\u00a339,000). The International Boxing Association (IBA), thanks to their Russian state energy company sponsor, will pay $100,000 (\u00a379,000) to gold medallists, $50,000 (\u00a339,000) for silver medals and $25,000 (\u00a320,000) for bronze (although it should be noted that the Russian-owned and Kremlin-linked IBA are banned by the Olympic authorities).\n\nIn time, most if not all Olympic athletes will be probably be paid something. It is naive to think that will not change gradually in time. But they will probably never be paid anything like the \u00a32m that Alcaraz earned last time he was in a final at Roland Garros.\n\nYou could argue that the lack of prize money makes Olympic tennis more, not less, pure, but that ignores the very nature of modern tennis. Cash is undeniably king in this sport. You only have to look at the Women's Tennis Association, founded in 1973 by openly gay Billie Jean King to land a huge blow in advocacy and equality for women in sport, which will in a few months hold its biggest tournament of the year in Saudi Arabia, an autocracy where women until 2018 were banned from driving, where they remain subject to a stringent set of male guardianship laws and where they are, along with men too, routinely thrown in prison for political dissent.\n\nOther Olympic sports are guilty of taking money from people who wish to use athletes as a means to a nefarious end of course, but at least those sports still have the decency to make this historic and ultimately worthy event their pinnacle.\n\nAnd that is what should define a sport as one that fits into the Olympics, one of the few events where the world comes together and has the goal of \"promoting peace, friendship and understanding through sport\".\n\nThe Olympic tennis tournament does not fit that mould. Barely a day went by this summer when some player or another declared they would not be playing the Games because it was inconvenient to switch to clay so close to the US Open, where the top players get around \u00a360,000 just for turning up and therefore took far higher priority.\n\nMost athletes regarding merely being selected for the Olympic Games a great honour, and the experience of actually spending time at them hugely enjoyable. Some tennis players do too. But they are increasingly few and far between.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_gray@inews.co.uk", "name": "James Gray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeongchang_County", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pyeongchang County"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pyeongchang County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billie Jean King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SEI_215875277.jpg?crop=0px%2C127px%2C2500px%2C1411px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Dozens watched the match in the players' lounge, including No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Jannik Sinner and his team.\n\nAfter the match, the world's best players were in awe of Djokovic's accomplishment. The Serbian defeated Alcaraz to complete his set of 'Big Titles'. He has won all four Grand Slam tournaments, all nine ATP Masters 1000 events, the Nitto ATP Finals and now the Olympic singles gold medal.\n\nHolger Rune thought the match was \"incredible\".\n\n\"I think if there's one person that deserves it so much, it's Novak. He's completed tennis in a way,\" Rune told ATPTour.com. \"He's taking tennis to another level. He's just the greatest. I take massive inspiration from him and I think he's a very nice guy as well.\n\n\"Novak is 37 now and winning the gold medal, I think it shows a little bit on the level he is producing. I think it's completely incredible. Hopefully we'll still see him a few more years on the Tour so we can compete against him.\"\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas explained that he could tell how much Djokovic wanted the final crowning jewel in his collection.\n\n\"He visualised getting a gold medal,\" Tsitsipas said. \"I'm sure he's someone that has been putting a lot of effort into making that happen. It is probably one of the things that he was missing as World No. 1 and a multiple Grand Slam champion, the gold medal. It was something that was not part of his collection.\"\n\nEn route to the gold medal, Djokovic defeated Tsitsipas in a tight two-setter in which the Greek had a big opportunity to claim the second set and force a decider.\n\n\"I felt like I was playing good at the Olympics myself and I had a massive lead against him in the second set. And I honestly did feel like I had some good chances in that particular match,\" Tsitsipas said. \"It was disappointing to see myself lose up there being a double break up in that match. But at least I can say I put my best effort and I lost to the champion, the gold medalist of the Olympic Games. I did try my best. Having played good tennis at Roland Garros, at least getting any kind of medal at the Olympics would have been a dream of mine.\"\n\nPablo Carreno Busta, a close friend of Alcaraz's who also has long trained at Juan Carlos Ferrero's eponymous academy, watched the first set of the gold-medal match before his practice session.\n\n\"I think that they played unbelievable tennis,\" Carreno Busta said. \"It's true that Carlos probably at the beginning was a little bit nervous, but that's normal. For Novak also, it probably was his last chance to [win] the gold medal. I think it was a big spectacle for tennis. Carlos and Novak are probably the best in this moment and we enjoy watching them.\"\n\nThe last player to defeat Djokovic at the Olympic Games was Carreno Busta, in the Tokyo bronze-medal match.\n\n\"Probably I played one of my best tournaments of my career. I remember that when I lost in semi-finals against Karen Khachanov, I thought, 'Well, if I lost against Karen and now I have to play against Novak, how many chances will I have to win the bronze medal?'\" Carreno Busta recalled. \"But then after that I I remember that when I started the match I just thought of doing my best and we'll see what happens. If Novak plays at his 100 per cent, it's true that it's very, very difficult for me to beat him but I know also Novak lost the day before in the semi-finals in singles, also in semi-finals in mixed doubles. So for him it was probably very, very tough mentally, and I think that I took advantage of this.\"\n\nOne of the players on Tour who has known Djokovic the longest is Gael Monfils. Their first Lexus ATP Head2Head match was in 2005 and the Serbian leads their series 19-0. Even so, the Frenchman was thrilled to see Djokovic triumph in Paris.\n\n\"He completed so much before. Novak is a legend in our sport,\" Monfils said. \"He is just completely special. He is completely different, completely special and for him I think it's the biggest accomplishment possible so I'm just super happy for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga\u00ebl_Monfils", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ga\u00ebl Monfils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_National_Bank_Open_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 National Bank Open \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ATP_Tour_top-level_tournament_singles_champions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of ATP Tour top-level tournament singles champions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Tsitsipas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefanos Tsitsipas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Carre\u00f1o_Busta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Khachanov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen Khachanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/08/05/04/04/djokovic-olympics-2024-montreal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Here are five must see moments. We focus on the sports of golf, tennis, cycling and athletics.\n\nSports fans are in for a real treat as world number two Novak Djokovic of Serbia is set to face world number three Carlos Alcaraz of Spain. You could tout this match as the greatest player in tennis history against the best player in tennis right now. Alcaraz and Djokovic have beaten each other thrice. Alcaraz, the four-time grand slam champion, beat Djokovic 6-7, 7-5, 7-6 in the semifinals of Madrid in 2022, 1-6, 7-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 in the finals of Wimbledon in 2023, and 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 in the finals of Wimbledon in 2024. Djokovic beat Alcaraz 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open, 5-7, 7-6, 7-6 in the finals of Cincinnati in 2023, and 6-3, 6-2 in the semifinals of the 2023 ATP Finals.\n\nXander Schauffele of San Diego is the hottest golfer in the world right now, and will be playing the best the LIV has to offer in Spain's Jon Rahm. Both Schauffele and Rahm are at -14 and tied for the lead heading into Sunday. Schauffele is also the reigning Olympic gold medalist.\n\nOne of the Olympics's signature events takes place on Sunday. The term signature should be used with caution however as at the Olympic Games the men's 100 mete race is worth the same amount when it comes to the overall medal standings as the women's dinghy sailing event or the men's flyweight boxing final. In any case, American Noah Lyles is the favourite after the reigning Olympic bronze medalist ran a time of 9.81 seconds at a Diamond League event in London right before the Olympic Games.\n\nEthan Katzberg of Nanaimo, British Columbia is the reigning world champion in the men's hammer throw. He is trying to become the third Canadian to win an Olympic medal in the event, following Con Walsh of Toronto, Ontario (bronze at the 1908 Olympic Games in London), and Duncan Gillis of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia (silver at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm).\n\nAfter Remco Evenepoel of Belgium accomplished the remarkable double of winning the men's time trial and road race in the same Olympic Games on Saturday, Grace Brown of Australia will look to accomplish the feat when the women's road race takes place on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

gold to haul", "body": "NOVAK DJOKOVIC completed tennis as he fulfilled a 16-year quest to have an Olympic gold medal placed round his neck.\n\nSerbia's sporting superstar, 37, arrived at the Athletes' Village in Saint Denis a few weeks ago having won nearly everything significant in his sport.\n\nHis unmatched success at Grand Slams have seen him surpass his great rivals Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal and means he is considered by many to be the Greatest Of All Time.\n\nThe one thing missing was the Olympic title for his country and in every Olympic cycle since 2008 - in the cities of Beijing, London, Rio and Tokyo - he had ultimately come up short in his mission.\n\nThat is no longer the case after he managed to get one over Carlos Alcaraz in Paris in two hours and 50 minutes, gaining a small measure of revenge for that Wimbledon Centre Court final defeat on July 14.\n\nAn unforgettable 7-6 7-6 victory on the red clay of Roland Garros, in a match for the ages, could end up being a stunning coup de gr\u00e2ce to arguably the best career we have witnessed in the men's side of the game.\n\nIn the build-up, one wag on social media had joked that Alcaraz was on a mission to 'save' tennis for a third time in an eight-week block.\n\nFirst, the 21-year-old prevented the unpopular and arrogant Alex Zverev from winning the French Open as he fought from 2-1 down in sets.\n\nNext up, those from the ABN (Anyone But Novak) brigade would have been happy that he stopped the Belgrade icon from equalling Roger Federer's tally of eight Wimbledon Championships.\n\nThat is a wee bit harsh on Djokovic - who was sporting a protective knee sleeve - and to be fair the attendees on Court Philippe-Chatrier were reasonably well-split with just as many Serbian flags as there were Spanish ones.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\nThis was a different crowd to those who watch the French Open annually - much noisier and rowdier and with a crying baby to add to the drama - but it made for a much better atmosphere.\n\nThis was a magnificent match and the margins of error were as fine as they had ever been in their six previous encounters.\n\nThis rivalry, defined by a 16-year age-gap, is one of the most spectacular we have ever seen.\n\nSome of the rallies were spellbinding to watch, this was edge-of-the-seat stuff and often the crowd rose to their feet to afford these racquet-welding gladiators a standing ovation for their gallant efforts.\n\nThere were 13 break-point opportunities in the first set but neither man could make that decisive in-road on their opponent's serve.\n\nA tie-break was required to resolve matters and after Djokovic had enjoyed a mini break with a wondrous forehand return, he moved a set closer to glory.\n\nWhen he converted the first of three set-points with a stretched volley at the net, Djokovic stood still and raised a clenched fist.\n\nThe match clock showed 93 minutes - it was one of the longest sets ever witnessed in Olympic history.\n\nThe second set went with serve through 12 games and you could see how much it meant to Djokovic - and how tight it was all getting - when he argued with the umpire on a serve call.\n\nIn the second tie-break, Djokovic achieved one of his proudest moments when his forehand down the line sailed past Alcaraz.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType":

This acceptance came after the Serb won a gold medal in the men's singles event at the Olympics 2024 on August 4.\n\nAhead of the Wimbledon 2024, Djokovic shared an update on his recovery on his social media, to which Roddick had commented on the 'Tennis Channel Live' podcast. Roddick believed that the former World No.1 wanted attention before making an appearance at Wimbledon and was different from the rest of the tennis fraternity.\n\n\"I was in the tournament once upon a time, but I was not doing this. He is not like us. He is a little bit different. This is incredible and I can't believe it. The fact that he is posting this he wants the attention of flirting with a Wimbledon bid and being healthy he is certainly not dealing with his injuries privately. This is crazy, the thing that he had surgery like a week ago,\" said the former American tennis player when asked about what he had to say on Novak's injury update.\n\nThis statement received a lot of backlash from Djokovic's fans, who thought that it came because of the rivalry the 41-year-old had with the Serb during the former's playing days. They accused him of making this statement deliberately due to the hard feelings he harbored in his heart for the now-Olympic gold medalist.\n\nHowever, Roddick's statement almost immediately after Djokovic's win at Roland Garros surprised everyone as he applauded his performance and accepted that he is the greatest. He also called it 'emotional' to watch the 37-year-old clinching the gold medal on his 'last chance'.\n\nHistory was yet again scripted in Paris as the 24-time Grand Slam champion finally completed his Career Golden Slam as he defeated the Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets.\n\nHowever, neither of the players could break the other's serve which resulted in a tie in both sets, pushing it to tiebreaks. Djokovic proved why he is best at tie breaks as he maintained his record of winning every match at Roland Garros when he has won a tiebreak since 2013.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nandini_rikhee@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Nandini Rikhee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Roddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/04/4e1b9fd0-novak-djokovic-andy-roddick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 277, "textEnd": 285}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

In keeping with the globalization of tennis, the phrase is also displayed in English.\n\nBut when Novak Djokovic got down on his knees on the clay, raising his arms to the sky in celebration of the Olympic title he had coveted for so long, did his misty eyes even see the words, as if written for him, right in front of him, a few meters above his head?\n\nThe Serbian player, who defeated Carlos Alcaraz (7-6 [3], 7-6 [2]) on Sunday, August 4, in the tournament's finest match, is a model of perseverance. It took a good dose of tenacity to win this hard-fought battle against the 21-year-old Spanish prodigy. In a breathless first set, of the 13 break points - eight for the Spaniard, five for the Serbian - all were saved. This set, in which only the tie-break was unbalanced, lasted an hour and a half.\n\nNumbers don't tell the whole story of the intensity of the encounter and, at times, its sublime violence. More than a match, it was a duel, with sparks of talent and fierce will. For two hours and 50 minutes, the players dealt out racket strokes like uppercuts. Even the most subtle drop shots - and there were plenty of them - were distilled in an attempt to speed up the outcome. A ring of clay, adorned with a net.\n\nOn their own service games, neither of them wavered. Giving in was out of the question. It took another tie-break to break the impasse. At that point, Djokovic's nerves of steel, his years of experience accumulated over the course of his 24 Grand Slam titles, and perhaps also his rarest lost finals, made him unbeatable.\n\nHaving won the French Open in June and then Wimbledon in July - against Djokovic - Alcaraz, who had never conceded a major final, concluded the tournament with his head held high, despite the disappointment. \"I had a hungry Novak in front of me,\" said Alcaraz. \"He played at an impressive level. He did not let me take the chances I had. I gave everything I had on the court.\"\n\nIn recent months, however, the Serbian has had his share of doubts. At the beginning of 2024, he revealed he was feeling low. Then in the spring came injury season, with problems to his right knee prematurely ending his participation at the French Open in June. Had he served his time? Would he recover from his operation in time for the Games? In nine days of tournament play, Djokovic provided very direct answers, always in two sets - he didn't lose a set during the whole tournament.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Globalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/08/04/0/0/4374/2187/1440/720/60/0/ee5da5f_5313043-01-06.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789158", "eventUri": "eng-9789158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 762, "textEnd": 770}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

They could not deliver the doubles title but perhaps that was simply too much to ask for.\n\nThree-time Grand Slam champion and two-time Olympic champion Andy Murray waved goodbye for a final time as he headed into retirement - and seemed happy for it to happen in Paris.\n\nThree-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber of Germany also said her farewell to the sport in what felt like a cross-generational Olympic tournament.\n\nChinese sport has a new superstar in the form of 21-year-old Zheng Qinwen who became the country's first Olympic singles champion by beating Donna Vekic in the women's final.\n\nAnd the other end of the spectrum, the high-quality men's doubles final featured 40-year-old American Rajeev Ram - the oldest player to contest an Olympic final since 1988 - in a clash in which the combined age was 147.\n\nAustralian pair Matthew Ebden and John Peers proved worthy winners, as did Czech pairing Katerina Siniakova and Tomas Machac in the mixed doubles.\n\nAnd just to bring the curtain down in fitting fashion, veteran Sara Errani and the ever-smiling Jasmine Paolini claimed Italy's first-ever tennis gold by winning the women's doubles.

"body": "Paris, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 4th Aug, 2024) Novak Djokovic's Olympic triumph against Carlos Alcaraz completes his collection of the game's biggest honours and enhances his status as the greatest men's player of all time.\n\nThe Serbian top seed defied a 16-year age gap at Roland Garros on Sunday to win 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) in what was likely to be his final shot at Olympic glory.\n\nThe 37-year-old had nothing to prove against a young rival who has time on his side to surpass even his own achievements but he showed an intense desire to win.\n\nAt the moment of victory he dropped to the red clay, shaking with emotion, showing how much victory meant for him.\n\nThe Serbian is already out on his own with 24 Grand Slams -- four more than career-long rivals Roger Federer and two ahead of Rafael Nadal.\n\nHe also has a stack of other records in men's tennis including a record 40 Masters-level titles and most weeks at number one -- a staggering 428.\n\nBut up until Sunday his best performance at the Olympics was a bronze in singles at the Beijing Games in 2008.\n\nHe had not won a single tournament so far this year but in Paris he showed the astonishing will to win that sets him apart as he simply refused to be beaten.\n\nDjokovic did not win another major until 2011 but since then he has been voracious, despite the occasional fallow period.\n\nHe has made no secret of his aim to be the greatest of all and few would now argue against that.\n\nJust weeks ago he had to pull out of the French Open ahead his quarter-final before undergoing knee surgery.\n\nAn exasperated John McEnroe expressed his frustration at the way that Djokovic is sometimes treated during last month's Wimbledon.\n\nThe American three-time Wimbledon champion added: \"He's by far the guy who's taken the worst heat and that's why I would say he's the greatest that's ever played.\"\n\nDjokovic has been content to plough his own furrow and has shown an astonishing ability to shut out the noise.\n\nHe dropped gluten from his diet early in his career, crediting the change with transforming his results.\n\nThe lithe physique of the rubber man of tennis enables him to chase down seemingly lost causes and he combines a brutally efficient game with a rock-solid defence.\n\nBut some personal stances have drawn criticism -- one claim that raised eyebrows was his belief that it was possible to alter the composition of water and food through positive thinking.\n\nAt the French Open last year, he wrote \"Kosovo is the heart of Serbia\" on a courtside tv camera lens as ethnic tensions were again rising in the Balkans.\n\nHis refusal to be vaccinated against Covid proved costly -- he was deported from Melbourne on the eve of the 2022 Australian Open.\n\nOn the court, time is ticking for Djokovic but he shows few signs of losing his physical edge -- half of his 24 Grand Slams have come after he turned 30 and he can go toe to toe with men nearly half his age.\n\nWhen he does finally hang up his racquet he can do so in the knowledge he has done it all.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [],

Both will go out with fireworks.\n\nElsewhere, American Noah Lyles headlines the men's 100-meter field and men's golf crowns a gold medalist. There are also medal events in archery, artistic gymnastics, badminton, boxing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, shooting and table tennis.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nTime: Tennis begins at 6 a.m. ET, noon in Paris. Novak Djokovic vs. Carlos Alcaraz is the second match of the day.\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz meet for the seventh time -- and second on the clay of Roland Garros -- for the men's singles gold medal.\n\nThe 37-year-old Djokovic, who tore his meniscus here at the French Open two months ago, is looking to add gold to his 24 Grand Slam titles. His only Olympic medal, a bronze, came in 2008.\n\nAlcaraz, 21, would continue the splendid start to his year with a victory. He won his first French Open here in June, added a Wimbledon title in July and could make it three-for-three if he defeats the all-time great.\n\nIn their lone meeting at Roland Garros, in the 2023 French Open semifinals, Djokovic prevailed in four sets after Alcaraz struggled through leg cramps.\n\nTime: 3:50 p.m. ET, 9:50 p.m. in Paris\n\nTV: NBC and Peacock\n\nWhat to watch: After winning a bronze medal in Tokyo in the 200 meters, American Noah Lyles comes to Paris with eyes on the gold in both the 100 and 200.\n\nHis first event comes Sunday, with the wickedly fast men's 100-meter dash. Lyles posted a lifetime best 9.83 seconds at U.S. Olympic trials when he made waves for running with a Yu-Gi-Oh card tucked inside his singlet. And Lyles has been talking the talk ahead of his Olympics.\n\n\"Everybody has their own vibe. I'm a showman,\" Lyles declared in the documentary series \"Sprint\" on Netflix.\n\n\"I feel like almost an artistic director. You have all these other athletes as stars, rock stars, popular wherever they go. Track and field needs to be the same. And I'm not gonna be happy until I see that accomplished.\"\n\nIn order to gain rock star status, Lyles will have to win. Kishane Thompson of Jamaica is expected to be his top competition. But all three medalists from Tokyo -- Italy's Marcell Jacobs, the United States' Fred Kerley and Canada's Andre De Grasse -- are in Paris, too.\n\nTime: 12:30 p.m. ET, 6:30 p.m. in Paris\n\nTV: NBC and Peacock\n\nWhat to watch: The nine-day swimming program reaches its conclusion with four medal races over a one-hour span.\n\nFirst up: The always-frantic women's 50-meter freestyle, where Sweden's Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Gretchen Walsh of the U.S. are among the medal contenders. It's followed by the men's 1,500 free, which represents the final chance for a U.S. man to capture individual gold. Bobby Finke, who won gold in Tokyo, qualified sixth in Saturday's semifinals, where Ireland's Daniel Wiffen swam the fastest time.\n\nThe final two events are relays -- the men's 4\u00d7100 medley and women's 4\u00d7100 medley. The Americans are reigning gold medalists in the men's relay, while Australia took the gold in the women's relay three years ago.\n\nTime: 11:15 a.m. ET, 5:15 p.m. in Paris\n\nTV: USA Network, Telemundo and Peacock\n\nWhat to watch: The U.S. looks to improve to 3-0 in France with a win over Germany in the final game of the group stage.\n\nThe Americans survived their biggest guaranteed test Thursday, beating Belgium 87-74 as A'Ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart combined for 49 points and 20 rebounds. Germany, meanwhile, is one of the Olympics' surprise stories. In its first Olympics, and as the No. 19 team in the world, it has defeated Belgium (No. 6) and Japan (No. 9) in its first two games.\n\nWhat to watch: Looking for a more feature-length watch Sunday morning? Tune in to the women's road race, where 93 competitors will start at the Pont d'I\u00e9na along the River Seine for a 158-kilometer race.\n\nAustrian Anna Kiesenhofer is the reigning gold medalist. The bronze medalist from Tokyo, Italy's Elisa Longo Borghini, also returns in Paris.\n\nAustralia's Grace Brown, Great Britain's Anna Henderson and the United States' Chloe Dygert -- the gold, silver and bronze medalists in the individual time trial on July 27 -- also hope to add to their medal counts.\n\nIt's hard to choose just one highlight from Saturday. But Katie Ledecky accomplished something only one other woman has in Olympic history by winning her ninth gold medal.\n\nLedecky tied Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina for the most gold medals by a female Olympian by winning the 800-meter freestyle for the fourth consecutive Games, outdueling Australian rival Ariarne Titmus.\n\nHonorable mention goes to Julien Alfred, who took the crown as the world's fastest woman in the 100 meters, capturing the first Olympic medal in Saint Lucia's history. And to Simone Biles, who made it three golds in Paris and seven all time.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

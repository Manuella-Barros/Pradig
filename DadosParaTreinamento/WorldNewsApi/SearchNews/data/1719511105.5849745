Dale Wells and Darren Neave, who own the Turntable Gallery on Grimsby Docks, are aiming to beat the current world record of 1,100 of the most messages in a bottle to go on display at any one time. As part of Festival of the Sea on Saturday, June 22, members of the public are invited to bring their own glass bottles to Alexandra Dock, near the Fishing Heritage Centre, with their own messages or pieces of art in them, or use one of the bottles already provided. Alternatively, they can send their messages via email.

We've got hundreds of bottles at the moment and people can come and place their messages in them or bring their own bottles with messages in them and display them alongside everyone else's. \"People can write anything they want in there, it's entirely private, it won't be public or read out. It's anything people want to write or feel they need to write, but as part of that we've had some exciting enquiries by local artists to ask if artistic messages can be included, too. \"Myself and Darren are going to be making pieces of work which fit inside the bottles, at the moment it's a closely guarded secret what that is, but we will display them on the day. We're inviting artists and creatives of all types from across our town to send in something a little bit more artistic. \"There's no criteria, the only thing we say is that it will be in a clear glass bottle, which will then be displayed in our stand at the festival.\" Dale said he hopes Grimsby can beat the current record of 1,100, which was previously achieved by the United Arab Emirates. \"Grimsby doesn't hold an accredited world record as a town - we have a couple of individual ones but not as a collective,\" he said. \"We've already had lots of donations of glass bottles from The Barge and The Yarborough Hotel. The Turntable has always been about building the community so we want the community to come along with us and be involved.\" You can email your messages and name over to messageinabottle@turntablegallery.uk, drop a completed message with or without a bottle into Turntable Gallery at 88 Wharncliffe Road, Grimsby or visit the marquee at Alexandra Dock on Saturday, June 22.", "summary": "Everyone is invited to get involved", "url": "https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/gallery-owners-gear-up-unique-9301664", "image": "https://i2-prod.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article9303127.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_b803b028-fcfb-4b43-a258-6d80649ef0f4.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:00:24", "author": "Lauren Davidson", "authors": ["Lauren Davidson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.044}

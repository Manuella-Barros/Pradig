{"id": 225023914, "title": "Mel B's ex-husband Stephen Belafonte demands $5 million from Spice Girl in bombshell defamation lawsuit", "text": "Stephen Belafonte wants to take Mel B to court. The film producer filed a bombshell $5 million defamation lawsuit against the Spice Girls member, whose real name is Melanie Brown, in a Florida court Wednesday, claiming she \u201cengaged in a deliberate and wide-ranging campaign to cause him severe emotional distress and destroy his reputation,\u201d court documents obtained by Page Six exclusively reveal. Belafonte, who submitted the suit on what happens to be Brown\u2019s 49th birthday, further alleges that his ex-wife began her \u201clong-brewing harassment\u201d in 2017 with domestic violence claims, which she \u201cdismissed\u201d before he had \u201chis day in court.\u201d \u201cNevertheless, the damage had been done. As a result of Ms. Brown\u2019s false allegations of rape, illegal gun possession, sex trafficking, production of illegal pornography, domestic battery and child endangerment, Mr. Belafonte lost access to his home and children,\u201d the documents read. Belafonte, also 49, notes in his lawsuit that despite Scary Spice accusing him of being a \u201cmonster\u201d and \u201cabuser,\u201d he has maintained primary custody of their 12-year-old daughter, Madison, since 2019. He further alleges the \u201cWannabe\u201d singer has visited their child \u201conly once\u201d in the past four years even though she has traveled to the US for work. In the legal papers, the \u201cThank You for Smoking\u201d producer includes text messages purportedly sent between Brown and her bandmate Geri Halliwell that show Brown\u2019s \u201ctrue intentions are to leverage her charitable appeal for further sales, celebrity and opportunity.\u201d \u201cCharity doesn\u2019t pay the bills,\u201d Brown allegedly wrote, to which Halliwell responded, \u201cI hope nobody ever hacks your texts!!!!! I believe we should do something good and kicking off with a charity gig would be hugely positive. The power of our brand is enormous and all of our work is off the back of it including Vikki [Victoria Beckham]!!!!!!\u201d Seemingly unfazed, Brown responded, \u201cWhy? My texts are fine to me anyways so no need to worry. Like I said charity doesn\u2019t pay the bills everyone no\u2019s [sic] that.\u201d Despite Brown\u2019s \u201cprivate\u201d beliefs about philanthropy, Belafonte accuses his former spouse of \u201cenriching herself through her charity ambassadorship at Women\u2019s Aid.\u201d He also claims in the documents that their marriage was marred by the former \u201cX Factor\u201d judge\u2019s \u201cserious substance abuse problem, which included the abuse of cocaine, alcohol and prescription drugs.\u201d We\u2019re told Belafonte is \u201cnot looking to settle\u201d and plans to split any earnings he wins from the lawsuit with an abuse program for women. Brown filed for divorce from Belafonte in March 2017 after nearly 10 years of marriage. Although she said years prior that he would never \u201clay a hand\u201d on her, she changed her tune after their split and accused him of beating and sexually exploiting her. The \u201cSpice World\u201d actress also alleged Belafonte had impregnated their nanny and received a restraining order against him to protect her and Madison. The former nanny, named Lorraine Gilles, turned around and claimed in court documents that the ex-couple had \u201cseduced\u201d her into having threesomes and filmed them. Belafonte vehemently denied the allegations. The divorce only worsened from there, with the British pop star cutting off Belafonte from her bank accounts \u2014 and her $50 million fortune. In May 2017, the \u201cMutant Chronicles\u201d producer broke his silence on the months-long accusations, calling Brown a \u201cdangerous liar\u201d in a series of explosive social media posts. Belafonte\u2019s claims came after he filed court documents alleging he was homeless and struggling to pay off a $60,000 credit card bill. In September of that year, Belafonte accused the former \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d judge of failing to provide evidence of his alleged abuse. The duo eventually settled their bitter divorce battle in December 2017, though the feuding did not end there. Three months later, Brown claimed Belafonte had showed her kids videos of ISIS beheadings, which he vehemently denied and responded by accusing her of being a drug addict. The pair finalized their divorce in August 2018, and the \u201cSpice Up Your Life\u201d singer had to pay Belafonte\u2019s $350,000 legal fees. Brown since has gotten engaged to hairstylist Rory McPhee. In addition to the $5 million in compensatory damages, Belafonte wants a trial by jury, punitive damages and a gag order against Brown. A rep for Brown had no comment on the lawsuit.", "summary": "The film producer claims his ex-wife \"engaged in a deliberate and wide-ranging campaign to cause him severe emotional distress and destroy his reputation.\"", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/05/29/entertainment/mel-bs-ex-stephen-belafonte-sues-spice-girl-for-defamation/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/82822449.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:05:00", "author": "Francesca Bacardi", "authors": ["Francesca Bacardi"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.281}

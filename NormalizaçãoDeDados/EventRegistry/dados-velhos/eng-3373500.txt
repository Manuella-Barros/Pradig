While she was there, she became depressed at the state of the care given to patients whose hands and feet she said had become \"nutritional supplement for the rats,\" according to the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre's (MALC) website.\n\nPfau decided to stay in Pakistan as a health care worker and her efforts in organizing a proper hospital building for the colony resulted in the creation of the first Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre, in Karachi.\n\nThanks to the work of Pfau and her center, in 1996, Pakistan was able to bring leprosy under control -- one of the first Asian countries to do so. Her organization now runs 157 leprosy control centers, with more than 800 staff members, according to MALC.\n\nForeign lady on a donkey\n\nBorn in Leipzig, Germany, in 1929, Pfau had seen firsthand the devastation wrought by World War II. She attributed her desire to become a doctor and a healer to this experience.\n\nAinee Shehzad, a member of the MALC board of trustees who worked with Pfau for 25 years, told CNN that she was \"one of the most inspirational\" people she had ever met.\n\nShehzad said Pfau was undeterred in her quest to help the underprivileged and that she would go to the \"remotest parts of Pakistan to help, a foreign lady heading on donkeyback to places even cars couldn't reach.\"\n\nThat dedication to heal brought Pfau honors from all over the world, including from Pakistan, her adopted homeland. In 1989, she was presented the Hilal-i-Pakistan, the country's second-highest civilian award.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T03:30:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 233, "textStart": 224, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8823529481887817, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373500", "time": "03:30:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373500", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48579", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303807", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Health care"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "score": 2}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 2}, {"id": "304269", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "score": 1}, {"id": "304285", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "score": 3}, {"id": "305821", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disease"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "score": 3}, {"id": "307248", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "score": 3}, {"id": "307777", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan", "score": 3}, {"id": "315248", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tuberculosis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis", "score": 3}, {"id": "317427", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dietary supplement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement", "score": 2}, {"id": "319343", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "21-gun salute"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21-gun_salute", "score": 4}, {"id": "325363", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Armed Forces"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces", "score": 3}, {"id": "335372", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Half-mast"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-mast", "score": 3}, {"id": "350971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "score": 5}, {"id": "357423", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shahid Khaqan Abbasi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi", "score": 3}, {"id": "383000", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mother Teresa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa", "score": 4}, {"id": "396779", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "State funeral"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_funeral", "score": 5}, {"id": "429970", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "History of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Pakistan", "score": 3}, {"id": "443471", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Flag of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Pakistan", "score": 3}, {"id": "1438381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Adelaide_Leprosy_Centre", "score": 3}], "image": "http://gantdaily.com/images/gant-og-logo.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:30:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "German nun called 'Pakistan's Mother Teresa' to receive state funeral", "originalArticle": null}

State-run television broadcast live footage of her casket being carried by a military guard at the city's St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nHundreds of people attended the service at the cathedral, including members of civil society and diplomats. She was later buried in a nearby cemetery, in a funeral attended by President Mamnoon Hussain, army chief Gen. Qamar Javed, senior government officials and Muslim religious scholars.\n\nThis was the second state funeral to have taken place in Pakistan over the past 29 years, with the last one accorded last year to late philanthropist and renowned humanitarian Abdul Sattar Edhi.\n\nMartha Fernando, who worked with Pfau at her Marie Adelaide Leprosy Center, said the German physician's death was a great loss to humanity. \"There is no one like her and there won't be any replacement to her. We pray to God to send people like her again to this world so that they could continue serving people,\" she said.\n\nPakistan suffered high rates of leprosy up until the mid-1990s.

She will always be fondly remembered. We have lost a national hero. May she rest in eternal peace,\" the statement said.\n\nThis was the second state funeral to have taken place in Pakistan in past 29 years, with the last one accorded to late philanthropist Abdul Sattar Edhi last year.\n\nThe prayers service for Dr Pfau was attended by hundreds of people including staff members of the Dr Marie Adelaide centre who wept as the last rites were performed.\n\nSindh Chief Minister Shah later announced that the state owned and run Civil Hospital in Karachi will be renamed the Dr. Ruth Pfau hospital in honour of the late German national who was given Pakistani citizenship in 1988.\n\nDr. Pfau was also awarded several civil awards for her services for leprosy patients and due to her efforts the World Health Organisation declared Pakistan a leprosy free country in 1996.\n\nShe also provided training to doctors to tackle the disease and helped Pakistan establish a National Programme for bringing this disease under control.\n\nHer organisation now runs 157 leprosy control centers, with more than 800 staff members, according to MALC.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:16:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 376, "textStart": 367, "imp": true, "date":

She set up 150 clinics across the country which treated tens of thousands of people.\n\nIn recognition of her work, the Pakistani government awarded Pfau the nation's second highest civilian honour, Hilal-i-Imtiaz, in 1979.\n\nIn 1989, she was presented with the Hilal-i-Pakistan, the country's highest civilian honour.\n\n--IANS\n\nsoni/bg\n\nSEARCH", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T14:05:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 17, "textStart": 11, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373500", "time": "14:05:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373500", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48218", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "48579", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48650", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303540", "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "305741", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Indo-Asian News Service"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Asian_News_Service", "score": 4}, {"id": "309433", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Government of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan", "score": 1}, {"id": "350971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "score": 5}, {"id": "383000", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mother Teresa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa", "score": 3}, {"id": "396779", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "State funeral"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_funeral", "score": 4}, {"id": "424818", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mamnoon Hussain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamnoon_Hussain", "score": 3}, {"id": "518271", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Air chief marshal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_chief_marshal", "score": 2}, {"id": "989166", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ruth Pfau"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Pfau", "score": 4}, {"id": "1278791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sohail Aman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohail_Aman", "score": 2}, {"id": "1438381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Adelaide_Leprosy_Centre", "score": 3}, {"id": "1438451", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Gora Kabristan, Lahore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gora_Kabristan,_Lahore", "score": 3}], "image": "http://static.sify.com/cms/commons/widget/images/featured-thumbs-default-img.gif", "timeCrawl": "14:05:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Pakistan's 'Mother Teresa' laid to rest in Karachi", "originalArticle": null}

She came to Pakistan in her 20s in 1960 and died at a local hospital in Karachi on August 15 at the age of 87 after protracted illness. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, while paying tribute to her, announced to hold a state funeral for her.\n\nThe funeral that was held at St Patrick's Cathedral was attended by dignitaries from across the country, including President Mamnoon Hussain, Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the chiefs of armed forces, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, German consul general, Dr Adeeb Rizvi, head of Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation, Karachi Mayor Waseem Akhter, MQM-Pakistan leader Farooq Sattar, Pakistan customs officials and several others.\n\nIt was due to her fight against leprosy that Pakistan was declared by the World Health Organisation as being able to control the disease.\n\nStrict security arrangements were in place for Dr Ruth's burial, with heavy contingents of security forces as well as aerial surveillance deployed for the occasion.\n\nThe city's main artillery, Shahrah-e-Faisal, was closed for traffic from Shahra-e-Quaideen to Regent Plaza. Vehicles coming from the airport were diverted to Shahra-e-Quaideen via Quaideen Bridge while those arriving from Korangi were diverted to Punjab Chowrangi.\n\nOfficials of the armed forces carried the casket containing Dr Ruth's body to St Patrick's Cathedral in Saddar in the highest military honour as accorded to humanitarian icon Abdul Sattar Edhi. The casket was draped in the national flag of Pakistan.\n\nThe flag of Vatican City was also hoisted at the Cathedral Saturday morning while the national flag of Pakistan remained at a half mast.\n\nA 19-gun salute was offered during the funeral proceedings, with contingents of all the three armed forces of Pakistan present on the occasion.\n\nOne-minute silence was also observed by the participants of the state funeral to pay tribute to the lady for her efforts to deal with leprosy in the country.\n\nBefore the last rituals, the patients and workers of Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre (MALC) founded by Dr Ruth to serve the leprosy patients in Pakistan, gathered around her body to look at the humanitarian whose lifelong struggle helped Pakistan defeat leprosy.\n\nDr Ruth Pfau came to Pakistan in 1960 and joined the mission to deal with leprosy in the country. She was so disappointed over the condition and facilities to deal with the disease in the leprosy centre near II Chundrigar Road that she decided to stay in Pakistan to help the affected patients.\n\nShe quickly reorganized the rough-hewn dispensary into a proper hospital building - a full service leprosy treatment and rehabilitation center, free to patients.\n\nIn 1968, Dr Pfau persuaded the Pakistan government to undertake a national leprosy control programme in partnership with MALC and began setting up leprosy-control centres across the country. Today, Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre is the hub of 157 leprosy control centres, with over 800 staff members.\n\nIn 1996, leprosy was controlled in Pakistan. The prevalence of the disease decreased to the extent that the World Health Organization declared the disease to be under control in Pakistan, one of the first countries in EMRO Region to achieve this goal.\n\nShe was granted Pakistani citizenship in 1988 and awarded numerous accolades for her services.\n\nSister Pfau was recognised in Pakistan and abroad as a distinguished human being and awarded many awards and medals. On 23 March 1989, Pfau received Hilal-e-Pakistan award presented by the then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan over her work for leprosy patients.\n\nOn August 14, 2010, on the occasion of Pakistan's Independence Day, the then President Asif Ali Zardari awarded Pfau Nishan-e-Quaid-i-Azam for services. She was hailed as Pakistan's Mother Teresa after her work towards helping people displaced by the 2010 floods in Pakistan.

He further said that she lived in the prayers of all those who were cured from leprosy as a result of her efforts.\n\n\"Her services for ailing humanity, particularly of Leprosy would always be remembered in the history of the country golden words\", he said while talking to the administration of Marie Adelaide Leprosy Center, Sadar he visited to express his grief with on the death of Dr Katharina, the founder of the center.\n\nHe said that her death has really moved him because she was a source of inspiration for him and others also. Her angel-like personality was a masiha for the Leprosy patients in the country. The soft speaking and a caring person, Dr Katharina dedicated her entire life for fight against Leprosy in Pakistan and before her death she successfully achieved her mission. \"Now, we have to carry her mission forward,\" he said.\n\nDr Ruth Katherina Martha Pfau, who born on September 9, 1929, was a German-Pakistani physician and nun of the Society of Daughters of the Heart of Mary. She devoted the last 50 years of life to fighting leprosy in Pakistan. In 1996, Pakistan was declared by the World Health Organization to have controlled leprosy, one of the first countries in Asia to achieve this goal\n\nPfau was born in Leipzig, Germany had four sisters and one brother. After World War II when the Russians occupied East Germany she escaped to West Germany along with her family, and chose medicine as her future career. In 1949 she studied medicine at Mainz.\n\nShe joined a Catholic order and eventually came to Pakistan. She may be called Pakistan's Mother Pfau (like Mother Teresa of India). She traveled north to south of Pakistan and across the borders to Afghanistan to rescue patients that were abandoned by their families or locked in small rooms for a life time.\n\nIn 1960, she decided to dedicate the rest of her life to the people of Pakistan and their battle against Leprosy outbreaks. She came to Karachi and visited a leprosy colony on McLeod Road behind the City Railway Station. Here she decided that the care of patients would be her life's calling. She started with medical treatment for the Leprosy patients in a hut in this slum.\n\nThe Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre was founded and social work for the leprosy patients and their family members was started by Dr. I. K. Gill. A Leprosy Clinic was bought in April 1963 and patients from all over Karachi, Pakistan, and even from Afghanistan came for treatment.\n\nPfau went to the far off areas of Pakistan where there were no medical facilities for leprosy patients. She collected donations in Germany and Pakistan and cooperated with hospitals in Rawalpindi and Karachi. In recognition of her service to the country, she was awarded Pakistani citizenship in 1988.\n\nOn the occasion of Pakistan Independence Day on 14 August 2010, the President of Pakistan awarded Dr Pfau the Nishan-i-Quaid-i-Azam for public service. In 2010 after her work helping people \"nobody else is willing or able, or ever thought of helping,\" people displaced by Pakistan's recent deadly flooding, she is being hailed as Pakistan's 'Mother Teresa'.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T18:46:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 4537, "textStart": 4523, "date": "2010-08-14", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 392, "textStart": 377, "date": "2017-08-10", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373500", "time": "18:46:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373500", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "2", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48218", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48300", "label": {"eng": "R\u0101walpindi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "R\u0101walpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "48579", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 2}, {"id": "304530", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "317280", "label": {"eng": "East Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "325363", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Armed Forces"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces", "score": 3}, {"id": "335372", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Half-mast"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-mast", "score": 3}, {"id": "350971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "score": 5}, {"id": "383000", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mother Teresa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa", "score": 2}, {"id": "415314", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Pakistan", "score": 3}, {"id": "424818", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mamnoon Hussain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamnoon_Hussain", "score": 5}, {"id": "518271", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Air chief marshal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_chief_marshal", "score": 3}, {"id": "989166", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ruth Pfau"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Pfau", "score": 4}, {"id": "1438381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Adelaide_Leprosy_Centre", "score": 3}], "image": "http://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pic19-020.jpg", "timeCrawl": "18:46:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Dr Ruth Pfau laid to rest with State honor - The Frontier Post", "originalArticle": null}

She came to the southern port city of Karachi in 1960 and spent half a century taking care of some of the country's sickest and poorest people.\n\nShe was the founder of Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Karachi, where she was being cared for at the time of her death after a short illness.\n\nPakistan President Mamnoon Hussain attended the state funeral service at St Patrick's Cathedral in the city, where hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects.\n\nThe casket, draped in the national flag, was carried by army personnel and Marie Adelaide staff and given a 19-gun salute.\n\n\"The entire Pakistani nation pays homage to Dr Pfau's extraordinary work. She will always be fondly remembered. We have lost a national hero,\" Pakistan's foreign office spokesman Nafees Zakaria said today in a statement.\n\nWorking with the government, Pfau expanded leprosy treatment centres in more than 150 cities and towns across Pakistan, training doctors, treating thousands of victims and helping establish a national programme to bring the disease under control.\n\nShe was honoured by the state with the country's two highest civilian awards, the Hilal-e-Imtiaz and the Hilal-e- Pakistan.\n\nPrime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi earlier expressed his sadness at her death, saying \"she may have been born in Germany, but her heart was always in Pakistan\".\n\nIt was after the horrors of World War II in her native Germany that Pfau decided to dedicate her life to serving humanity, becoming a doctor and joining the Daughters of the Heart of Mary order, founded during the French Revolution.\n\nNot required to take the veil or live in seclusion, she ended up in Pakistan by chance. En route to work in India, visa complications forced her to break the journey in Karachi, where she visited a lepers' colony.\n\nPfau was also praised for her work in helping victims of devastating flooding in 2010, which left millions of people homeless across swathes of the country.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:54:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 253, "textStart": 244, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373500", "time": "20:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373500", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48579", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 2}, {"id": "305821", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disease"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "score": 2}, {"id": "305931", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "score": 3}, {"id": "315069", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "French Revolution"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution", "score": 2}, {"id": "319343", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "21-gun salute"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21-gun_salute", "score": 3}, {"id": "345167", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nun"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "score": 4}, {"id": "350971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "score": 5}, {"id": "357423", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shahid Khaqan Abbasi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi", "score": 2}, {"id": "377044", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Islam by country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country", "score": 3}, {"id": "383000", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mother Teresa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa", "score": 3}, {"id": "396779", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "State funeral"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_funeral", "score": 4}, {"id": "415314", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Pakistan", "score": 3}, {"id": "424818", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mamnoon Hussain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamnoon_Hussain", "score": 3}, {"id": "602044", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hilal-i-Imtiaz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilal-i-Imtiaz", "score": 2}, {"id": "989166", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ruth Pfau"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Pfau", "score": 4}, {"id": "1438381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Adelaide_Leprosy_Centre", "score": 3}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "20:54:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "State funeral for Pakistan's 'Mother Teresa'", "originalArticle": null}

She has acceded to the request from her community in Karachi, only in the hope of acquiring an Indian visa from here.\n\nFrom the airport she is driven to the girl's hostel at Guru Mandir, at walking distance from the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. On the way she has noticed the bougainvillea hedges along the roadside and mistaken them for roses. Attired in a warm winter coat, she finds the sweltering heat of tropical Karachi unbearable.\n\nExhausted by her long journey, she feels sick and hungry. But Mother Mary Doyle, the superior at the hostel, insists that she attend a prayer session before the meal. Her first day in Asia is grueling. The night is spent fighting the oppressive heat and the noise of a radio, blaring on the other side of the half-partitioned room. A drowsy Ruth finds Pakistan not to be a very hospitable land.\n\nDuring the ensuing weeks, she finds herself tongue-tied and bored. The elementary English she had learnt at her school in East Germany stands forgotten. The smattering of French that she has picked up during her stay in Paris enables her to communicate with Berenice, a pharmacist from Mexico and, besides Ruth, the only non-American in the group. Berenice is fluent in French besides Spanish, which is her mother-tongue. It takes Ruth three weeks to revive her proficiency in spoken English. Then one day, Berenice invites her to come along to the 'McLeod Road Lepers' Colony', off Karachi's main commercial artery.\n\nOn this fateful day in 1960, Ruth Pfau decides to stay in Pakistan, to serve the ones unserved and whom no one else would ever serve.\n\n-- Excerpt taken from the book 'Serving the Unserved: A biography of Dr. Ruth Pfau' by Zia Mutaher\n\nAt a time when leprosy affected people were stigmatised and treated with mere bandages, fate landed Dr Ruth Pfau in Pakistan.\n\n\"People would be shocked to see her touch leprosy patients as they were considered untouchable,\" recalled Nisar Malik, Media Manager at the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Karachi.\n\nBorn on 9th September, 1929 in Leipzig, Germany, Dr Ruth grew up seeing the horrors of the Second World War, during which her country was bombed and destroyed. When the war ended, the country had been divided into East and West Germany.\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 17, she somehow managed to cross the border into West Germany, where she pursued her education in medicine and graduated as a doctor in 1950.\n\nFeeling unsatisfied and with a desire to do something more purposeful, she decided to dedicate the rest f her life to the poor people of the world.\n\nWhen Dr Ruth left Germany in 1960, her organisation, Daughters of the Heart of Mary, had not expected her to stay for long in Pakistan. The organisation had decided to send Dr Ruth on an assignment to India, but due to visa constraints, she was advised to first go to Pakistan from where she could apply for a visa to the country of her intended destination.\n\nBut it so happened that Dr Ruth spent the rest of her life in Pakistan, a country she came to call home. Her remarkable service for the country helped contain leprosy in Pakistan.\n\nAs per the initial plan, Dr Ruth Pfau applied for an Indian visa during her initial stay in Pakistan. But it was her visit to a dispensary - a small hut on II Chundrigarh Road (then known as McLeod Road) where leprosy affected people were being treated with mere bandages - that made her change her mind.\n\nIt was at this dispensary that she met one of the thousands of Pakistani patients suffering from the disease.\n\n\"He must have been my age -- I was at this time not yet 30 -- and he crawled on hands and feet into this dispensary, acting as if this was quite normal,\" she told the BBC in 2010, \"as if someone has to crawl there through that slime and dirt on hands and feet, like a dog.\"\n\nStunned at the sight, Dr Ruth wrote to her organization, telling them that she was more needed in Pakistan and requesting for permission to stay in the country.\n\nUpon being granted the permission, Dr Ruth laid the foundation of the first leprosy centre in Pakistan, the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre (MALC), only within three years of her arrival in the country.\n\nHowever, since due to the mindset that considered lepers 'untouchables', the workers and medics working with Dr Ruth had to shift patients to the centre in the dark of the night.\n\nEventually, the existence of the centre came to the knowledge of locals, raised a hue and cry over lepers being kept in the same area they were residing in.\n\nA case against the centre was filed at the High Court, but Pakistan was not sans support for philanthropy.\n\nDr Ruth was helped by Dr Zareena Fazalbai, who belonged to an influential family of the country and helped her fight the case for the centre.\n\nDr Ruth's work was not limited to helping patients in Karachi.\n\nIn a bid to expand the treatment process to other areas, she started off with educating medics in different parts of the country. Although Dr Ruth was not well-versed in Urdu, or any other language spoken in Pakistan, she would somehow manage to communicate with local residents and medics.\n\nThe leprosy healer even took to the streets to create awareness on the disease.\n\nIn 1968, she persuaded the Pakistani government to undertake a National Leprosy Control Programme in partnership with the MALC.\n\nSoon, she and her team began setting up leprosy-control centres across the country, laying the foundations of similar institutions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 1975, 1976 and 1984 respectively.\n\nShe travelled to the most remote and rugged corners of Pakistan by horseback, camelback, and by foot to trace patients with the disease.\n\nHer hard work finally bore fruit in 1996, when the World Health Organisation declared Pakistan the first country in the Eastern Mediterranean Regional office region to have controlled leprosy.\n\nQuiz: How well do you know Dr Ruth Pfau?\n\nWhile the German medic was busy in her endeavors in Pakistan, her work was being recognised far and wide. She was awarded multiple awards in the USA, Australia, her home country Germany, and Pakistan.\n\nHer awards include The Order of The Cross with Star from the German government, the Hilal-e-Imtiaz, Hilal-e-Pakistan, and the Nishan-e-Quaid-e-Azam from the Pakistani government, and the Magsaysay from the government of Philippines.\n\nDr Ruth was even visited by Mother Teresa, who travelled from India to meet the philanthropist that had left her home and family for leprosy patients in Pakistan.\n\nAt present, 157 centres started by Dr Ruth are working in the country, according to Malik. Not only are the patients at these centres treated for leprosy, they are also looked after for other ailments.\n\nEvery year, between 400 and 500 patients are treated at Dr Ruth's centre. Currently, around 550 leprosy patients are under treatment at the hospital, while the number of overall registered patients is 57,700.\n\nUntil 2000, Dr Ruth would personally look after all the affairs of the centre, Malik said. But she retired from her position in 2002. Then onwards, she would go to Germany every year to collect funds for the foundation under which the centres are running, he added.\n\nAccording to Malik, Dr Ruth would visit Germany every year until her family members were alive -- she last visited her home country in 2012, after which doctors advised her to stop travelling such long distances due to her health.\n\nMalik said Dr Ruth would say Germany was the place of her origin, but it was Pakistan where her heart belonged.\n\n\"Which is why,\" he added, \"she wished to be buried in the country where her heart belonged.\"", "dateTime":

These abandoned people lay prostrate at the lowest possible depth physically, socially and materially. Providence acts in its own special ways when human hopes recede and so sent us Dr Ruth Pfau. The German Christian missionary was on her way to India on a medical mission and had merely stopped over in Karachi to change planes. Her Indian visa being delayed, she was taken around to see the leprosy patients in Karachi. This was her introduction to Pakistan. More specifically, this was when she first came in contact with her lasting love; the so-called 'lepers'.\n\nOne look at their plight and her mind was made. She pledged to help the leprosy patients all over Pakistan (and Afghanistan). She fully honoured her word and almost single-handedly cleansed the country of leprosy 50 years later. The effort was never for all the awards and acclamations she was bestowed with by a grateful Pakistani nation. The effort was motivated by the love of the Almighty and His people. The prime minister's announcement of a state funeral for Dr Pfau was most appropriate as was the tribute by the army chief. This is one occasion where all Pakistanis are on the symbolic 'same page'.\n\nState funeral for Dr Ruth Pfau being held in Karachi\n\nI was very fortunate to have met and known Dr Pfau for nearly three decades in relation to her life's mission. Though I have also met some of the biggest names of the last quarter of the 20 century from different spheres, including Nelson Mandela, Edhi sahib and Princess Diana (sadly, I did not meet Mother Teresa), but my greatest hero ever would always be Dr Pfau. I remained associated with her dedicated efforts in the Malakand division, the tribal areas and then in Gilgit-Baltistan. She impressed everyone by her loving care for those affected by leprosy when most would not even look at, let alone touch, these unfortunate people.\n\nOne of her stories, I heard from someone, needs sharing. In a certain district a deformed victim of leprosy was placed in a nearby cave to prevent the spread of the disease. Left-over food was provided to him knowing he had not long to live. His hair was full of lice, while bugs and worms gnawed on him. Enter our heroine. She washed and cleaned him, fed and treated him in comfort. Allah healed him so much that he became a useful member of society. If there is a better example of sawab, a noble deed, kindly inform me as well.\n\nI would like to quote the following lines relating to Dr Pfau from my forthcoming book. Incidentally, I had requested her a few months back to be the chief guest at its launch. Now I must be content with her memories only.\n\n'The greatest individual I ever recall meeting and getting to know was a German doctor, Ruth Katherina Pfau. This saintly caregiver, through the Marie Adelaide Centre, devoted her entire life to eradicating leprosy from Pakistan and later concentrated her attention on tuberculosis control. She was my hero and it is a small coincidence that we share our date of birth, September 9. She was meant to break her journey in Karachi on her way to Bombay in 1960, but thanks to the incompetence of the Indian bureaucracy, her visa was delayed inordinately. She therefore decided to stay and work in Pakistan. In a sense we owe the eradication of leprosy in Pakistan to the incompetence of the Indian bureaucracy. This was a silver lining because our bureaucracy could not have achieved it on its own. As she lived most of her life in Pakistan, I once asked her what was the one trait she found irksome in the Pakistani people. She was prompt in her reply. Whenever and to whomsoever she made a request for assisting patients, invariably replied that there was 'no problem madam no problem'. The problem, she thought, was that 'there was actually a problem' because rarely did people stand by their word. For most Pakistanis, a promise or a commitment is vacuous and never really meant to be followed up. Lip service is cheap and is readily offered but do not expect most Pakistanis to follow up on their commitments. A word is never a bond for most people here. One last word about Dr Pfau may be in order. At the golden jubilee celebration of the successful battle against leprosy in Swat, Chief Minister Mir Afzal Khan was the guest of honour to a lunch, which she insisted, only consist of dal, roti, pani (lentils, bread, water), with everyone, including the chief guest, paying for the food. This was the only function I have seen where money was actually raised while celebrating a previous achievement. When will we learn such fine art?'\n\nMarie Adelaide Leprosy Centre mourns loss of Dr Ruth Pfau\n\nAs Pakistan bids farewell to its most distinguished daughter, I hope that the medical ward named after her in the Gilgit hospital retains her name plaque and the three jeeps of her organisation in K-P are retrieved from unlawful possession.\n\nIt may sound strange that Dr Pfau, our great hero, was a woman and that too from a minority community -- two segments generally denied full rights here. The white in the flag may be acquiring greater meaning as Pakistan turns 70. Let us not lose her legacy. Let us receive her baton and make a new beginning where Dr Pfau left.

She will always be fondly remembered. We have lost a national hero,\" Pakistan's foreign office spokesman Nafees Zakaria Saturday said in a statement.\n\nWorking with the government, Pfau expanded leprosy treatment centres in more than 150 cities and towns across Pakistan, training doctors, treating thousands of victims and helping establish a national programme to bring the disease under control.\n\nShe was honoured by the state with the country's two highest civilian awards, the Hilal-e-Imtiaz and the Hilal-e-Pakistan.\n\nPrime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi earlier expressed his sadness at her death, saying \"she may have been born in Germany, but her heart was always in Pakistan\".\n\nIt was after the horrors of World War II in her native Germany that Pfau decided to dedicate her life to serving humanity, becoming a doctor and joining the Daughters of the Heart of Mary order, founded during the French Revolution.\n\nNot required to take the veil or live in seclusion, she ended up in Pakistan by chance. En route to work in India, visa complications forced her to break the journey in Karachi, where she visited a lepers' colony.\n\nPfau was also praised for her work in helping victims of devastating flooding in 2010, which left millions of people homeless across swathes of the country.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:47:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 257, "textStart": 248, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.729411780834198, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373500", "time": "19:47:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373500", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48579", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 2}, {"id": "305821", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disease"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "score": 2}, {"id": "315069", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "French Revolution"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution", "score": 1}, {"id": "319343", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "21-gun salute"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21-gun_salute", "score": 3}, {"id": "345167", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nun"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "score": 4}, {"id": "350971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "score": 5}, {"id": "357423", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shahid Khaqan Abbasi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi", "score": 2}, {"id": "377044", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Islam by country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country", "score": 3}, {"id": "383000", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mother Teresa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa", "score": 3}, {"id": "396779", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "State funeral"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_funeral", "score": 4}, {"id": "415314", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Pakistan", "score": 3}, {"id": "424818", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mamnoon Hussain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamnoon_Hussain", "score": 3}, {"id": "602044", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hilal-i-Imtiaz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilal-i-Imtiaz", "score": 2}, {"id": "989166", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ruth Pfau"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Pfau", "score": 4}, {"id": "1438381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Adelaide_Leprosy_Centre", "score": 3}], "image": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/1/0/4/8/0/9/3/i/3/5/3/p-large/5ef04a07b82ac027e3bc6d9feb312a8f981b9011.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:47:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "State funeral for Pakistan's 'Mother Teresa'", "originalArticle": null}

She was granted Pakistani citizenship in 1988 and received numerous accolades for her services, including the country's top civilian awards Hilal-i-Imtiaz and Hilal-i-Pakistan.\n\nPresiding over the funeral mass at St Patrick's Cathedral, the pastor paid glowing tribute to Dr Ruth and her selfless life spent serving the country's poor.\n\n\"She lived and died a Pakistani. Wherever she went to treat people, she became one of them. She treated them all with love and compassion. She gave her life to others,\" he said,recalling that she used to say, \"I'm not treating a disease, I'm treating a person.\"\n\n\"She brought a wonderful change in the society with her love and selflessness. She transformed people's lives. She taught us all to take care of those who [could not care for themselves],\" the pastor continued.\n\n\"It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness,\" he recalled another one of her sayings.\n\nThe pastor urged people to take her work forward and to continue her mission of helping and serving others. After her final rites were performed at the church, the coffin\n\nof 'Pakistani Mother Teresa' Dr Pfau was taken to Gora Qabaristan, Karachi's oldest graveyard, where she was laid to rest.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:10:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2378, "textStart": 2363, "date": "2017-08-10", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373500", "time": "12:10:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373500", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "236", "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "48218", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48579", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "305821", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disease"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "score": 1}, {"id": "309433", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Government of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan", "score": 3}, {"id": "325363", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Armed Forces"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces", "score": 2}, {"id": "335372", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Half-mast"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-mast", "score": 2}, {"id": "350971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "score": 5}, {"id": "369063", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Farooq Sattar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farooq_Sattar", "score": 3}, {"id": "369065", "label": {"eng": "Muttahida Qaumi Movement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttahida_Qaumi_Movement", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "383000", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mother Teresa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa", "score": 4}, {"id": "422172", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh_Institute_of_Urology_and_Transplantation", "score": 3}, {"id": "424818", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mamnoon Hussain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamnoon_Hussain", "score": 3}, {"id": "443471", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Flag of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Pakistan", "score": 3}, {"id": "498002", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Abdul Sattar Edhi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Sattar_Edhi", "score": 2}, {"id": "518271", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Air chief marshal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_chief_marshal", "score": 3}, {"id": "602044", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hilal-i-Imtiaz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilal-i-Imtiaz", "score": 2}, {"id": "703130", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zubair"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zubair", "score": 3}, {"id": "755099", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civil decorations of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_decorations_of_Pakistan", "score": 2}, {"id": "989166", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ruth Pfau"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Pfau", "score": 4}, {"id": "1438381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Adelaide_Leprosy_Centre", "score": 2}, {"id": "1438451", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Gora Kabristan, Lahore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gora_Kabristan,_Lahore", "score": 4}], "image": "http://pakobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/59980af88970f.jpg", "timeCrawl": "12:10:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Dr Ruth Pfau laid to rest with full state honours in Karachi - PakObserver", "originalArticle": null}

This is what always struck me whenever I went to the MALC\" -- the clinics the nun founded.\n\nThe network of more than 100 MALC (Mary Adeline Leprosy Center) centers in Pakistan stretches from the Thar Desert in southern Sindh to the barren hills of Balochistan to the northern borders with Iran and Afghanistan, Archbishop Coutts noted.\n\nBorn in Leipzig, Germany, in 1929, where her home was bombed in World War II, Pfau went to France to study medicine and later joined the Society of Daughters of the Heart of Mary.\n\nUpon arrival in Karachi in 1960, Sister Ruth was touched by what she saw at the leprosy colony off Macleod Road in Karachi, a work of charity initiated three years earlier by another member of her congregation, Sister Bernice Vargasi from Mexico.\n\nSister Ruth founded the MALC in 1962 in Karachi; it included Pakistan's first hospital dedicated to treating the disease and later extended its branches in all provinces of Pakistan.\n\n\"Dr. Pfau, for us, was a living legend, the moving spirit behind the leprosy-control program,\" Mervyn Lobo, director of the MALC and associate of Sister Pfau since 1990, told the Register.\n\nAs the MALC network spread to far corners of Pakistan, Lobo said, Sister Ruth inspired the formation of the National Leprosy Control Program that worked closely with MALC. The result: In 1996, the World Health Organization declared Pakistan as one of the first countries in Asia to be free of leprosy.\n\nSister Ruth's major role in eliminating leprosy, and her concern for the underprivileged in Pakistan, was resonant in the tribute Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi of Pakistan paid to the nun who had been conferred Pakistani citizenship and several national awards.\n\n\"Pfau may have been born in Germany -- her heart was always in Pakistan,\" said the prime minister within hours of her death.\n\n\"We will remember her for her courage, her loyalty, her service to the eradication of leprosy and, most of all, her patriotism,\" Abbasi said.\n\nDescribing her service as \"nothing less than a pure manifestation of God's divine love,\" the National Commission for Justice and Peace (NCJP) of Pakistan's Catholic Church noted that \"Dr. Ruth worked tirelessly for the poor and the marginalized communities and was locally known as the 'Mother Teresa of Pakistan.'\"\n\n\"It was due to her endless struggle that Pakistan defeated leprosy,\" the German Consulate in Karachi posted on Facebook.\n\nLobo, a Catholic associated with MALC for 27 years, described the nun as \"a visionary who single-handedly structured the National Leprosy Control Program across the country.\"\n\nSister Ruth also established Pakistan's national training institute for leprosy technicians, and those seeking government employment had to complete a two-year diploma course via the center to join the various government leprosy agencies that worked in tandem with MALC.\n\n\"A messenger of peace, she worked as if there is no tomorrow,\" recalled Lobo.\n\n\"Being a very spiritual person, she believed in actual service as worship to God. Though she suffered a lot of misery, this did not deter her. The name of our center building was named after her firm belief in the Holy Mother Mary,\" he added.\n\n\"Sister Ruth Pfau was such a dedicated and selfless person that she infused a spirit of love and kindness in everyone who happened to meet her,\" Peter Jacob, executive director of the Lahore-based Center for Social Justice, told the Register.\n\n\"My meeting with her was quite a spiritual experience, strengthening my belief in larger-than-life concepts and living up to egalitarian approaches. She proved that love and kindness can transcend all boundaries and survive in difficult circumstances,\" said Jacob, who served as executive secretary and director of the NCJP for 26 years.\n\nThe MALC network has more than 270 staff, drawn from Pakistan's many ethnic communities, and a medical team of a dozen doctors -- most of them non-Christians. Among the doctors who long served under Sister Ruth's leadership is Dr. Mutahir Zia, a Muslim who is the current medical director of MALC.\n\n\"When I passed my medical degree in 1988, I wanted to work in a charitable organization. Since most of the private hospitals were run on profit motives, I was lucky to join Dr. Pfau,\" said Zia.\n\nDescribing Sister Ruth as a woman with \"extraordinary compassion and courage,\" Zia recalled, \"Even when she had no money, she went on taking up new ventures and challenges. Wherever she went, she captured the peoples' imagination with her simplicity. Many came forward with offers of help.\"\n\nDuring the earthquake of 2005, she moved to the mountains of Kashmir to build houses for the quake victims, including those affected by leprosy. Zia noted that Sister Ruth also cared for refugees from Afghanistan who were facing deportation and even ventured into jails to care for those in detention.\n\nAmong the numerous glowing tributes to the nun in the Pakistani media was an article in the leading English daily The Dawn, titled, \"My First Meeting With Dr. Ruth Pfau, the Angel of Manghopir.\"\n\nJournalist Owais Tohid recounted his encounter with Sister Ruth as a journalist in training 26 years earlier, including her explanation of why she had dedicated her life to serving Pakistan's lepers.\n\n\"Outcast, alienated, in miserable conditions without any medical facilities, and without normal human interactions,\" she said of the suffering. \"When I saw that, it changed my life.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T13:40:00Z",

She was 87. Born in Germany, Dr Ruth came to Pakistan in the 1960s.

With the help of funds from Germany in 1963 a small clinic was acquired.\n\nLater, this one storied building expanded to an eight storied medical building.\n\nIn 1968, Dr Pfau persuaded the Government of Pakistan to undertake a National Leprosy Control Programme in partnership with Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre (MALC) and began setting up Leprosy control centers across the country.\n\nToday, Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre is the hub of 157 Leprosy control centers, with over 800 staff members.\n\nIn 1996, Leprosy was controlled in Pakistan. The prevalence of the disease reduced to the extent that the World Health Organization declared the disease to be under control in Pakistan, one of the first countries in EMRO Region to achieve this goal.\n\nAfter eliminating Leprosy, she started work on other health disciplines like TB and blindness control to utilize the free capacity and ensure presence in the field of Leprosy.\n\n\"Can we imagine that a person can leave the comfortable and luxurious life of developed country and choose a hard life only to live for sake of humanity,\" Dr Nighat Yasir, a social activist said.\n\nShe said that Dr Ruth Pfau devoted her life for a noble cause.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T10:44:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373500", "time": "10:44:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373500", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48650", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 3}, {"id": "302547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "score": 4}, {"id": "303806", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Physician"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "score": 2}, {"id": "304530", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "304906", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "score": 3}, {"id": "305821", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disease"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "score": 2}, {"id": "305931", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "score": 3}, {"id": "309433", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Government of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan", "score": 2}, {"id": "326358", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "score": 2}, {"id": "350971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "score": 5}, {"id": "387666", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Eradication of infectious diseases"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases", "score": 4}, {"id": "989166", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ruth Pfau"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Pfau", "score": 5}, {"id": "1438381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Adelaide_Leprosy_Centre", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.brecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruth-Pfau2-1024.jpg", "timeCrawl": "10:44:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Rich tributes paid to Dr Ruth Pfau | Business Recorder", "originalArticle": null}

A spokesperson for the city's power utility said: \"KE had the honour of working with Dr Ruth in her capacity as the founder of the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre (MALC), which is the electric company's first social investment programme partner.\"\n\nThe statement said that KE paid tribute to Dr Ruth's untiring and selfless devotion towards humanitarian work and that she would always be remembered as the pinnacle of empathy and dedication. Dr Ruth was also the recipient of KE's Pride of Karachi award among numerous other accolades she had received for her services.\n\n\"The power company's partnership with the MALC goes beyond just the provision of free electricity to the centre.

She later opened treatment centres across the country.\n\n\"It is a big loss to this hospital and to humanity,\" said Yasmeen Morris, a staff member at the centre. \"It is very hard to find a person like her in today's era.\"\n\nYasmeen said Dr Ruth led a very simple life and loved humanity. \"In 1996 the World Health Organisation declared that leprosy had been controlled in Pakistan, which led Dr Ruth to the more challenging task of eliminating the disease.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:04:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.572549045085907, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373500", "time": "01:04:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373500", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "48218", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "48579", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302504", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Health"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "score": 3}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 4}, {"id": "303807", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Health care"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "score": 2}, {"id": "304283", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Christian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian", "score": 3}, {"id": "305821", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disease"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "score": 1}, {"id": "309438", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sayyid"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid", "score": 3}, {"id": "350971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "score": 5}, {"id": "383000", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mother Teresa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa", "score": 2}, {"id": "383655", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civil Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Hospital", "score": 5}, {"id": "396779", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "State funeral"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_funeral", "score": 5}, {"id": "496497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Memon people"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memon_people", "score": 3}, {"id": "515279", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "K-Electric"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Electric", "score": 3}, {"id": "989166", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ruth Pfau"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Pfau", "score": 4}, {"id": "1438381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Adelaide_Leprosy_Centre", "score": 3}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2017-08-20/l_224648_041635_print.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:04:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Civil Hospital Karachi renamed after Dr Ruth Pfau", "originalArticle": null}

State-run television broadcast live footage of her casket being carried by a military guard at the city's St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nHundreds of people attended the service at the cathedral, including members of civil society and diplomats. She was later buried in a nearby cemetery, in a funeral attended by President Mamnoon Hussain, army chief Gen. Qamar Javed, senior government officials and Muslim religious scholars.\n\nThis was the second state funeral to have taken place in Pakistan over the past 29 years, with the last one accorded last year to late philanthropist and renowned humanitarian Abdul Sattar Edhi.\n\nMartha Fernando, who worked with Pfau at her Marie Adelaide Leprosy Center, said the German physician's death was a great loss to humanity. \"There is no one like her and there won't be any replacement to her. We pray to God to send people like her again to this world so that they could continue serving people,\" she said.\n\nPakistan suffered high rates of leprosy up until the mid-1990s. Pfau played a key role in efforts to bring the disease under control.\n\nAccording to Dawn, Pakistan's leading English daily, chief minister of Pakistan's Sindh province, Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, announced the renaming of Civil Hospital Karachi after Dr. Ruth Pfau following the state funeral.\n\n\"Dr. Pfau was the pride of Sindh and the pride of Pakistan,\" Shah said.\n\nHe directed the chief secretary to issue a notification regarding the change of the hospital's name to Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital.\n\nDr. Pfau, who was German by birth, had been sent to Pakistan in 1960 by the Daughters of the Heart of Mary -- a congregation of nuns that she was a member of -- for a medical service for students.\n\nAfter witnessing the plight of leprosy patients, she decided to settle here. She was granted Pakistani citizenship in 1988.\n\nIn 1979, she was awarded the Hilal-i-Imtiaz, the second highest civilian award of the country. In 1989, Dr. Pfau was presented the Hilal-i-Pakistan for her services.\n\nDue to Dr. Pfau's persistent and selfless efforts, Pakistan was declared \"leprosy-free\" in 1996 by the World Health Organization. -- Agencies", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:04:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 276, "textStart": 269, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8627451062202454, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373500", "time": "04:04:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373500", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "concepts": [{"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48218", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sindh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "48579", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303629", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim", "score": 4}, {"id": "303806", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Physician"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "score": 4}, {"id": "305821", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disease"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "score": 2}, {"id": "345167", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nun"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "score": 4}, {"id": "350971", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "score": 5}, {"id": "383000", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mother Teresa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa", "score": 3}, {"id": "396779", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "State funeral"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_funeral", "score": 5}, {"id": "424818", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mamnoon Hussain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamnoon_Hussain", "score": 3}, {"id": "498002", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Abdul Sattar Edhi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Sattar_Edhi", "score": 3}, {"id": "602044", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hilal-i-Imtiaz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilal-i-Imtiaz", "score": 1}, {"id": "989166", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ruth Pfau"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Pfau", "score": 5}], "image": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/themes/saudigazette/images/no-image.png", "wgt": 1, "timeCrawl": "04:04:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Pakistan's 'Mother Teresa' laid to rest with state honor", "originalArticle": null}], "pages": 100}}}

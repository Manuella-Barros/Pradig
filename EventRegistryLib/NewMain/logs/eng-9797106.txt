West and Northern Ireland, the latest Halifax house price index revealed.\n\nOverall, prices increased by 0.8% last month compared to June, with values of homes expected to increase further after the Bank of England decided to cut interest rates at the start of the month, making it easier for Brits to get a mortgage.\n\nAnnually, home prices have jumped by 2.3%, representing the largest increase year-on-year since January and causing the average house price to reach \u00a3291,268.\n\nNorthern Ireland experienced the sharpest rise out of any region, with prices 5.8% ahead of where they were a year ago, while the North West saw home values jump 4.1% compared to 2023.\n\nAmanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax, said: \"Last week's Bank of England's Base Rate cut, which follows recent reductions in mortgage rates, is encouraging for those looking to remortgage, purchase a first home or move along the housing ladder.\n\n\"However, affordability constraints and the lack of available

session by some positive macro data in the US, which led to the three Stateside indexes closing up around 1%.\n\nOvernight in Asia, stocks appeared to rally for a second consecutive day, with the Nikkei, which suffered its second worst day ever on Monday before jumping double-digits on Tuesday, up close to 1.5%.\n\nIndia's Nifty 50 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose around 1%, while South Korea's

This shift is a game-changer for prospective buyers.\n\n'Lower rates translate to reduced monthly payments and increased purchasing power, potentially opening doors for those previously priced out.'\n\nGame changer: The Bank of England cut the base rate from 5.25% to 5% on 1 August\n\nRegional divide remains\n\nNorthern Ireland continues to record the strongest property price growth of any nation or region, rising by 5.8 per cent year-on-year, according to Halifax.\n\nHouse prices in the North West also recorded strong growth, up 4.1 per cent, compared to the previous year.\n\nIn Wales, house prices grew 3.4 per cent to \u00a3221,102 which is the highest price seen since October 2022.\n\nScotland saw a rise in house prices of 2.1 per cent more than the year before.\n\nThe only region or nation to record a fall across was Eastern England. Properties here now average \u00a3330,282, down 0.4 per cent compared to last year.\n\nIain McKenzie, chief executive of The Guild of Property Professionals said: 'It's particularly heartening to see strong performance in regions like Northern Ireland and the North West.\n\n'This regional variation highlights the diverse nature of the UK property market and the opportunities available across different areas.'\n\nWhat next for house prices?\n\nAt the start of the year, almost every major forecast was suggesting prices would fall over the course of 2024.\n\nNow, almost every commentator across the property sector is convinced the only way is up.\n\n'UK house prices have found their mojo again,' said Anthony Codling, head of European housing and building materials for investment bank RBC Capital Markets.\n\n'The value of the average house has increased by \u00a36,650 over the last 12 months.\n\n'Last week we saw the first bank rate cut, and we believe that mortgage rates will trend down over the coming months.\n\n'If we throw into the mix wages rising and cost of living pressures easing it looks likely that house prices will continue to rise.'\n\nAside from the price of the average home rising, there are fresh signs of the market gradually moving from a buyers to a sellers market again.\n\nHow quickly are houses selling?\n\nAlmost a quarter of homes that came onto the market in the first half of July went under offer within two weeks, according to separate data from the estate agent Hamptons.\n\nThis is up from 15 per cent during the same period in 2023 and up from 19 per cent between January and June this year.\n\nThe share of sellers accepting big discounts on their asking price has also fallen to the lowest level since mortgage rates spiked at the end of 2022.\n\nJust 2.2 per cent of sellers in England and Wales accepted an offer which was more than 10 per cent below their final asking price in July, down from a peak of 5.1 per cent in December 2022.\n\nAnd rising house prices and lower mortgage rates have meant that fewer sellers are having to reduce their asking price.\n\nSome 46 per cent of homes sold across England & Wales in July had a price reduction, slightly down from 47 per cent in June this year and 56 per cent in October 2023 when price reductions peaked.\n\nJonathan Hopper, chief executive of buying agent Garrington Property Finders said: 'More recent anecdotal evidence shows that estate agents are starting to see buyer enquiries pick up as consumer confidence rises.\n\n'In some areas the number of homes for sale is high compared to the number of buyers, and this imbalance is making it an out and out buyer's market.\n\n'Nevertheless, the prospect of cheaper mortgages is finally here, and many would-be buyers who had been holding off are asking themselves the question 'if not now, then when?'\n\nHow to find a new mortgage\n\nBorrowers who need a mortgage because their current fixed rate deal is ending, or they are buying a home, should explore their options as soon as possible.\n\nWhat if I need to remortgage?\n\nBorrowers should compare rates, speak to a mortgage broker and be prepared to act.\n\nHomeowners can lock in to a new deal six to nine months in advance, often with no obligation to take it.\n\nMost mortgage deals allow fees to be added to the loan and only be charged when it is taken out. This means borrowers can secure a rate without paying expensive arrangement fees.\n\nKeep in mind that by doing this and not clearing the fee on completion, interest will be paid on the fee amount over the entire term of the loan, so this may not be the best option for everyone.\n\nWhat if I am buying a home?\n\nThose with home purchases agreed should also aim to secure rates as soon as possible, so they know exactly what their monthly payments will be.\n\nBuyers should avoid overstretching and be aware that house prices may fall, as higher mortgage rates limit people's borrowing ability and buying power.\n\nHow to compare mortgage costs\n\nThe best way to compare mortgage costs and find the right deal for you is to speak to a broker.\n\nThis is Money has a long-standing partnership with fee-free broker L&C, to provide you with fee-free expert mortgage advice.\n\nInterested in seeing today's best mortgage rates?

The autumn may therefore prove to be busier than anticipated. However, prospective buyers are now faced with a dilemma about whether to fix their mortgage now or wait for rates to come down further.\n\n\"Lots of clients in the midst of remortgaging or buying are considering tracker mortgages without early repayment charges [ERCs], allowing them to benefit from future rate cuts with the option to fix when rates are lower. However, many people like the certainty of a fixed-rate deal.\"\n\nTomlinson said that house price growth, which was good news for homeowners, continued to make it \"incredibly difficult for first-time buyers\", with them either having to rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad or wait to buy a home.\n\n\"This will end up being a difficult area for the government to truly tackle, as while supply and demand play a large part in why house prices are rising, an even bigger piece of the puzzle is slow wage growth when compared to house price inflation,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mortgage Solutions"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_sagar@mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "name": "Anna Sagar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East of England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halifax, Nova Scotia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Halifax, Nova Scotia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_ladder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property ladder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_land", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brownfield land"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply and demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2024/01/mortgage-increase-764x399-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797106", "eventUri": "eng-9797106", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

This shows the market still had plenty of energy in it despite the General Election. Even amid the turmoil of recent years, with higher interest rates and a cost of living crisis, house prices have remained remarkably robust, leaving those who have consistently predicted large-scale falls with egg on their faces and starting to soften their words.\n\n\"As we approach a period where interest rates are falling, all that pent-up demand is starting to feed through. High-demand areas where there is a shortage of properties to buy could see larger house price rises. For those looking at buying, the next few months will prove to be a good time to buy, especially when looking back in hindsight in five years' time.\"\n\nREAD MORE UK households in council tax bands A to D face 'potential prison sentence'\n\nRanald Mitchell, Director at Charwin Mortgages today said: \"As the Halifax suggests, the recent base rate cut is set to invigorate the property market by reducing borrowing costs and making mortgages more affordable, thereby stimulating demand. However, affordability remains an issue for many potential buyers.\n\n\"We are on the cusp of a sellers' market due to reducing mortgage rates and the ongoing lack of supply. As lenders continue to cut rates, more affordable mortgage options will boost demand, encouraging hesitant buyers to take the leap. For buyers, the message is clear. Act swiftly to capitalise on lower rates and avoid being priced out of the market.\"\n\nChris Barry, Director at Thomas Legal added: \"We saw new enquiries jump 80% in July compared to the same month last year. New enquiries have been at a record high for us since the begining of the spring and did not drop off even through the General Election. The increased demand seems to be driven by the quiet year that was 2023, a time when the trajectory of interest rates was still uncertain. The Bank of England cutting the base rate could make people even more confident.\"\n\nRiz Malik, Director at R3 Mortgages said: \"The expectation is that prices will continue to rise considering the recent cut in the base rate and the outlook for further cuts ahead. However, those sitting on their hands waiting for rates to continue to drop might find they end up paying more as competition and confidence return to the market.\"\n\nRohit Kohli, Director at The Mortgage Stop commented: \"This morning's figures from the Halifax confirm what we are seeing on the ground, namely that prices are starting to climb again. Last week's base rate cut is already starting to fuel demand further and we will see prices continue to rise. However, although borrowing costs are starting to reduce those already struggling with deposits are going to have to work harder to keep up with rising prices. Also, mortgage prices in the higher loan-to-value brackets haven't reduced by as much as the lower brackets, so affordability is still the biggest struggle at the moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_West_Yorkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Halifax, West Yorkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Halifax, West Yorkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u2013present_United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Council Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan-to-value_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loan-to-value ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/article29691727.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_halifax.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797106", "eventUri": "eng-9797106", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Northern Ireland, the latest Halifax house price index revealed.\n\nOverall, prices increased by 0.8% last month compared to June, with values of homes expected to increase further after the Bank of England decided to cut interest rates at the start of the month, making it easier for Brits to get a mortgage.\n\nAnnually, home prices have jumped by 2.3%, representing the largest increase year-on-year since January and causing the average house price to reach \u00a3291,268.\n\nNorthern Ireland experienced the sharpest rise out of any region, with prices 5.8% ahead of where they were a year ago, while the North West saw home values jump 4.1% compared to 2023.\n\nAmanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax, said: \"Last week's Bank of England's Base Rate cut, which follows recent

Nikkei, which suffered its second worst day ever on Monday before jumping double-digits on Tuesday, up close to 1.5%.\n\nIndia's Nifty 50 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose around 1%, while South Korea's

No small group of people should monopolise what gets monetised\".\n\nMusk added in a tweet: \"We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war.\"\n\n7.38am: House prices kick higher in July\n\nUK house prices ticked higher in July after three previous months of staying flat, helped by strong rises in the North West and Northern Ireland, the latest Halifax house price index revealed.\n\nOverall, prices increased by 0.8% last month compared to June, with values of homes expected to increase further after the Bank of England decided to cut interest rates at the start of the month, making it easier for Brits to get a mortgage.\n\nAnnually, home prices have jumped by 2.3%, representing the largest increase year-on-year since January and causing the average house price to reach \u00a3291,268.\n\nNorthern Ireland experienced the sharpest rise out of any region, with prices 5.8% ahead of where they were a year ago, while the North West saw home values jump 4.1% compared to 2023.\n\nAmanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax, said: \"Last week's Bank of England's Base Rate cut, which follows recent reductions in mortgage rates, is encouraging for those looking to remortgage, purchase a first home or move along the housing ladder.\n\n\"However, affordability constraints and the lack of available properties continue to pose challenges for prospective homeowners.\n\n\"Against the backdrop of lower mortgage rates and potential further Base Rate reductions, we anticipate house prices to continue a modest upward trend throughout the remainder of this year.\"\n\n7.17am: FTSE 100 to open higher\n\nThe FTSE 100 is on track to open nearly 100 points higher at around 8,114 as London's blue-chip index looks to stage another session of recovery following Monday's heavy sell-off.\n\nUK stocks closed higher on Tuesday, having spent much of the day in the red, only helped towards the end of the session by some positive macro data in the US, which led to the three Stateside indexes closing up around 1%.\n\nOvernight in Asia, stocks appeared to rally for a second consecutive day, with the Nikkei, which suffered its second worst day ever on Monday before jumping double-digits on Tuesday, up close to 1.5%.\n\nIndia's Nifty 50 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose around 1%, while South Korea's Kospi jumped by 2%.\n\nBack in the UK, today, investors will be looking at results from Glencore, L&G and WPP among others.\n\nLegal & General Group's upcoming interims will hopefully provide some

Last week the base rate dropped from 5.25% to 5%, and we'd already seen many lenders factor the cut into their mortgage deals before the announcement from the Bank of England. With lending rates beginning to come down, and hopefully on a more permanent basis than we've seen previously, it seems the market may be stabilising.\n\n\"Millions of households who are due to renew their fixed mortgages this year will be glad to see the threat of potentially crippling mortgage repayments finally beginning to subside. If we can continue on this trajectory, buyer confidence may start to stoke the market. In fact, Finder recently polled a panel of experts to ask how much they believe house prices will change by the end of 2024, and 70% expect house prices to rise by up to 2.5% by the end of the year.\"\n\nSam Mitchell, CEO of Purplebricks, said: \"The growing confidence we've seen take hold of the housing market in recent weeks has been supercharged by the Bank of England's interest rate cut. With lenders already slashing mortgage rates in response to last week's decision, buyers are beginning to move ahead with purchasing decisions they have been putting off for months.\n\n\"However, the rental market is still a complete mess and there is a significant way to go before the outlook can be said to be as positive for prospective homeowners. The focus for the coming months must be lowering the barriers to homeownership for first-time-buyers, which will only be achieved by Labour pushing forward with its plans to 'get Britain building'.\"\n\nNathan Emerson CEO at Propertymark comments: \"It is extremely positive to see further growth within the housing sector, especially following what has been a tough time across the last few years for consumers. With inflation now down at targeted levels and with a very welcome cut in interest rates last week, Propertymark is extremely optimistic to see a real uplift across the housing sector over the coming months. Assuming the economy remains stable in September, it would be good to see the central bank continue to gradually cut interest rates as conditions permit. It is a case of all eyes on the UK Government regarding their housebuilding programme, as well as learning more regarding support for potential first-time buyers.\"\n\nJonathan Hopper, CEO of Garrington Property Finders, comments: \"In the space of a month, two handbrakes have come off the property market. Gone is the election uncertainty which suppressed activity in May and June, and last week's decision by the Bank of England to cut the Base Rate for the first time in four years has finally allowed mortgage lenders to start reducing the cost of borrowing.\n\n\"But even if it feels like the market is cleared for take-off, the most recent hard data suggests it's still barely at taxiing speed. The number of completed purchases and the number or mortgage approvals both fell in June.\n\n\"More recent anecdotal evidence shows that estate agents are starting to see buyer enquiries pick up as consumer confidence rises, but the summer holidays mean few agents' phones are ringing off the hook yet, and on a regional level it's still a very a mixed picture.\n\n\"In some areas the number of homes for sale is high compared to the number of buyers, and this imbalance is making it an out and out buyer's market. Serious buyers who have their finance in place can often drive a very hard bargain, and in response sellers are both pricing competitively and open to offering a price reduction in return for the certainty of a sale to a 'proceedable' buyer.\n\n\"Nevertheless the prospect of cheaper mortgages is finally here, and many would-be buyers who had been holding off are asking themselves the question 'if not now, then when?'\n\n\"Keenly priced new listings are receiving healthy levels of interest, and the signs are are encouraging for a busy 'back to school' market in September. The recovery is on, but it will be a marathon and not a sprint.\"\n\nMatt Thompson, head of sales at Chestertons, says: \"Despite uncertainty about what the Bank of England's decision on interest rates cuts was going to be on 1 August, July's property market still saw an increase in buyer activity. This buyer confidence was not only boosted by the General Election results but also by lenders introducing more attractive mortgage products with sub-4% rates.\"\n\nNicky Stevenson, Managing Director at national estate agent group Fine & Country, said: \"This year's housing market has been a rollercoaster, but July saw house prices gain momentum. Affordability issues and high interest rates caused many potential buyers to put their plans on pause in recent months. However, economic indicators are broadly trending positive and consumer confidence is growing.\n\n\"The Bank of England's recent rate cut is set to further energise the property market as we enter the second half of 2024. In response, lenders have ignited a rate war, slashing offers to stay competitive. This shift is a game-changer for prospective buyers. Lower rates translate to reduced monthly payments and increased purchasing power, potentially opening doors for those previously priced out.\n\n\"Nationwide has made headlines by reintroducing fixed-rate mortgages below the 4% mark, a move that's sent ripples through the industry. They've slashed rates by up to 0.25% across their two, three, and five-year fixed rate products, setting a new benchmark for affordability. Not to be left behind, banking giants Barclays and TSB have swiftly followed suit, announcing their own rate cuts.\n\n\"For those who've been hesitating to take the plunge into homeownership, this could be a game-changing moment. First-time buyers, in particular, should take note. This shifting landscape could make that first step onto the property ladder more achievable than it's been in recent months.\n\n\"As we look ahead, some financial experts are hinting at the possibility of further rate cuts later in the year. While this paints an optimistic picture, it's crucial to remember that everyone's financial situation is unique. For now, though, it seems the property market is offering a window of opportunity.\"\n\nHolly Tomlinson, financial planner at Quilter: \"The Halifax House Price Index for July shows that house prices have edged up. The average house price increased by +0.8% in July while the annual growth rate is now +2.3%. With summer typically marking a busy period for the property market, this result following three months of relatively flat results, reflect the difficult economic conditions we find ourselves in.\n\n\"However, given that the Bank of England has cut its base rate from 5.25% to 5%, we may see the market start to heat up. Although the cut in rates will have a relatively minor impact on the amount people pay if they are on tracker mortgages or standard variable rate mortgages (SVR) and no impact if they are on a fixed rate, the change in rates does a lot for buyer and seller confidence.\n\n\"Similarly, the price of fixed-rate deals had largely already priced in a small cut to the base rate, so we have not seen a huge change in the cost of these deals.\n\n\"A feeling that rates are going in the right direction though will help many people decide to take the leap back into the market, pushing up demand for homes. Those on the fence about selling their home may also feel the time is now right.\n\n\"The autumn may therefore prove to be busier than anticipated. However, prospective buyers are now faced with a dilemma about whether to fix their mortgage now or wait for rates to come down further. Lots of clients in the midst of remortgaging or buying are considering tracker mortgages without early repayment charges, allowing them to benefit from future rate cuts with the option to fix when rates are lower. However, many people like the certainty of a fixed-rate deal.\n\n\"Further house price rises, while naturally good news for homeowners, continue to make it incredibly difficult for first-time buyers to find a route to homeownership without significant help from the Bank of Mum and Dad or having to wait until much later in life to build up the necessary size of deposit. This will end up being a difficult area for the government to truly tackle, as while supply and demand play a large part in why house prices are rising, an even bigger piece of the puzzle is slow wage growth when compared to house price inflation.\"", "source": {"uri": "ifamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFA Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purplebricks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purplebricks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Estate agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestertons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chestertons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_construction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-time_buyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First-time buyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Halifax, Nova Scotia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Halifax, Nova Scotia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(surveying)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (surveying)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSB_Bank_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TSB Bank (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barclays"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ifamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/talk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797106", "eventUri": "eng-9797106", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 4425, "textEnd": 4433}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Addressing newsmen after their meeting in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital during the weekend, the President said that it is because of the activities of the quacks and the spate of malpractices that they are calling on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to quickly make a proclamation for the constitution and inauguration of the Governing Boards of regulatory agencies in health especially that of the Medical Laboratory Council of Nigeria. \u201cIt is the Governing Boards that can set up the tribunals that will investigate and try culprits. And for more than two years now, the Medical Laboratory Council of Nigeria has been without a board and therefore, the Governing Board disciplinary committee is now set in abeyance\u201d. Dr Ifeanyi noted that they are out to flush out quacks, \u201cWe have given out platforms for membership of the public to bring reports on activities of persons they consider quacks or they think may have wronged them in cause of seeking service or cases of negligence which most times are perpetuated by quacks\u201d. \u201cI also want to say that most places you go to to obtain testing or medical laboratory testing are not operated by our members, are not registered with the Medical Laboratory Council of Nigeria and that is because we have retired the police, the Governing Board is the police. Government must restore the boards so the boards can carry out its mandate of regulating practitioners, regulating facilities, curbing malpractice\u201d. \u201cThe worry we have about quackery which we are complaining about is not the quackery that is happening in the private, that is easy to curtail. It is the quackery happening in public health institutions, those owned by government that is a major trouble. We have tagged that guarded quackery. You are a quack under government protection. When you employ a zoologist and post him to be conducting testing, he is there protected by government as a quack. When you employ a Science Laboratory Technologist who is not a Medical Laboratory Scientist and you deploy him to medical laboratory and that is the case in many States of the federation, government is providing shield for quacks\u201d. He explained that, \u201cwhen you employ those who studied Biology, Biochemistry, Microbiology as single honours without any form of licencial and you deploy them to provide testing in any form or guide, that is guarded quackery by government\u201d. \u201cWe are up against them, we are raising alarm to the society to know that, that is the practice and to condemn it and to hold management of these hospitals to account to ensure that we do not have wrong persons dealing with testing\u201d. \u201cTesting is a very delicate and dexterity endeavour. It must be manned by somebody who has requisite training and licention. It is not for charlatans, it is not an all comers endeavour.We are aware that most pharmacy shops in Nigeria are now laboratories, we are aware that most patent shops in Nigeria are now laboratories. We want to raise alarm that, that is a disaster waiting to happen, a public health disaster\u201d He applauded the Governor of Ebonyi State, Rt. Hon Francis Nwifuru-led administration for the priority given to the health sector for which reason they gave the Governor award of excellence.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"487\" height=\"227\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0027.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0027.jpg 487w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0027-300x140.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" /></div>Association of MedicalM Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria (AMLSN) said that failure of the Federal Government of Nigeria to inaugurate Governing Boards of regulatory agencies in her health sector, especially that of the Medical Laboratory Council of Nigeria is responsible for the menace of quacks in the country&#8217;s health system President of the body, Dr Casmir [&#8230;]", "url": "https://independent.ng/fgs-failure-to-inaugurate-regulatory-boards-in-health-sector-bane-of-quackery-amls/", "image": "https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0027.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:43:11", "author": "Shojobi Abisola", "authors": ["Shojobi Abisola"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.163}

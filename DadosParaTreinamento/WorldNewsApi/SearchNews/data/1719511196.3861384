The Dominican actor and TV presenter, 39, was attending the premiere of the French film The Count of Monte Cristo, based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas and directed by Matthieu Delaporte, when the incident occurred. Just days earlier, former Destiny\u2019s Child singer and solo artist Kelly Rowland was seen scolding the same usher after she appeared to stand on the star\u2019s dress at the Marcello Mio premiere. Writing on Instagram, Taveras said The Count of Monte Cristo red carpet had been the \u201cmost powerful moment\u201d she had ever experienced and called the night \u201cunforgettable\u201d. In the viral video of Taveras at the premiere, the star posed on the red carpet, in a dress with a white train embellished with a picture of Jesus Christ. The female security guard could be seen guiding the actor inside as she tried to pose for photos, which fans on social media claimed ruined the actor\u2019s moment in the spotlight. The guard appeared to place her arm over Taveras\u2019 head and chest as she attempted to usher her inside. Taveras then turned around and seemingly placed her hand over the guard\u2019s face in retaliation. Taveras has since reposted articles with Rowland\u2019s comments about the same red carpet security guard to her Instagram story, while not directly commenting on the incident herself. \u201cThe woman knows what happened; I know what happened,\u201d Rowland told AP Entertainment. \u201cI have a boundary, and I stand by those boundaries and that is it. And there were other women who attended that carpet, who did not look quite like me,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t get scolded, or pushed off or told to get off. And I stood my ground, and she felt like she had to stand hers. But I stood my ground.\u201d Praising Rowland, Taveras reshared multiple posts detailing the singer\u2019s comments and told her followers \u201cwe need respect\u201d. Rowland became aggravated with the Cannes security guard when she stepped on the train of her dress and placed her hand very close to the star\u2019s back. The \u201cMotivation\u201d singer turned around to speak sternly to the guard \u2013 who appeared not to back down \u2013 before Rowland raised her finger to visibly scold her. Other event staff appeared to calm the guard down as the singer walked away from the altercation. The guard could be seen laughing with colleagues. Fans have since come to Rowland\u2019s defense, with many feeling that the guard had been disrespectful toward her by standing on her dress and attempting to \u201crush\u201d her up the stairs. Users on X/Twitter have also defended Taveras. \u201cThis lady is a straight up hater,\u201d one person wrote on X/Twitter of the usher. \u201cShe needs to be terminated.\u201d", "summary": "<p>\u2018We need respect,\u2019 the actor said</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/massiel-taveras-cannes-security-dress-kelly-rowland-b2551809.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/26/16/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/MhrUVqEG-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:56:14", "author": "Lydia Spencer-elliott", "authors": ["Lydia Spencer-elliott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.155}

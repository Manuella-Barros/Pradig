triumph.\n\nThe 25-year-old captain of the French national team had announced he was leaving Paris St Germain in a video posted on social media platform X on May 10.\n\nWhat's next in the Kylian

surprised PSG last year when he sent a letter stating he would not take up the option of a one-year contract extension when it expires in June.\n\nThe letter led to a standoff with the club and Mbappe

HERE WE GO.\n\n'The saga is finally over. Kylian Mbappe joins Real Madrid as a free agent at the end of the season.\n\n'The contract has been signed, the announcement will be really soon, in the next weeks, but Real Madrid will have one more star in their squad.\n\n'Kylian Mbappe joins from PSG and it's an historic HERE WE GO.'\n\nA move to the Bernabeu will finally end the speculation that has followed Mbappe throughout his career.\n\nIt was reported in February that Real - who won the Champions League on Saturday - had reached an agreement with Mbappe that would see the forward join on a free transfer in the summer, with an \u00a385.5million signing-on fee, meaning the Spanish giants will get their man after a seven-year pursuit.\n\nNo official announcement has been forthcoming, but Mbappe explained back in March that one would be made ahead of Euro 2024 in Germany this summer, where he will captain France.\n\n'People will know my future before the Euros. I'm very calm about it,' he had told Telefoot.\n\n'My future is no longer a huge topic at the club, no one talks to me about it anymore.\n\n'I'll be at the Euros with calm head, ready to do great things.'\n\nDespite his exit from PSG being expected from as far back as last summer, Mbappe only officially announced he would be leaving on Friday, May 10 as he shared a heartfelt message to the club's fans.\n\nDespite the constant speculation, Mbappe scored 44 goals in 48 games over the season\n\nThe 25-year-old leaves as PSG's all-time record goalscorer, having netted 256 times in Paris\n\n'I wanted to speak to you. I've always said that I would speak with you when the time comes, and so I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain,' he said.\n\n'I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks.\n\n'I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. It's a lot of emotion; many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club - one of the best in the world - which allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure.\n\n'To grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history - some of the greatest champions; to meet a lot of people, to grow as a man as well, with all the glory and the mistakes I've made.\n\n'It's hard, and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that, to leave my country, France, Ligue 1, a championship I have always known, but I think I needed this - a new challenge after seven years.'\n\nThe claims from Romano on Sunday come after L'Equipe also reported on Friday that Mbappe will be unveiled as a new Real player on Monday, fewer than 48 hours after their Champions League final triumph over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley.\n\nMeanwhile, during a training session with France on Thursday, Mbappe met with fans, and even signed one lucky person's Real shirt - a sure-fire sign that this deal will be finalised shortly.\n\nLast week, it was also reported that the relationship between PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and the departing Mbappe remains strong, despite claims that a rift had emerged over the terms of his departure as a free agent.\n\nBoth the club and the player have previously stated there is an agreement in place that respects PSG's huge investment in Mbappe's development as a player since his \u00a3166m move from Monaco in 2017.\n\nMbappe is set to add significant firepower to a Real team who enjoyed a brilliant campaign\n\nMbappe is currently preparing for Euro 2024 with France, where he will captain the side\n\nMbappe won the Coupe de France in his final match for PSG, ending his last season at the club with 44 goals in 48 appearances in all competitions.\n\nThe French star then threw a farewell party for 250 guests in Paris, as his former PSG team-mates bid goodbye to him after seven years on their books.\n\nMbappe leaves as PSG's all-time record goalscorer, having scored 256 goals in 308 appearances over seven years in Paris.", "source":

HERE WE GO.\n\n'The saga is finally over.

I've always said that I would speak with you when the time comes, and so I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain,' he said.\n\n'I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks.\n\nThe 25-year-old leaves as PSG's all-time record goalscorer, having netted 256 times in Paris\n\n'I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. It's a lot of emotion; many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club - one of the best in the world - which allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure.\n\n'To grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history - some of the greatest champions; to meet a lot of people, to grow as a man as well, with all the glory and the mistakes I've made.\n\n'It's hard, and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that, to leave my country, France, Ligue 1, a championship I have always known, but I think I needed this - a new challenge after seven years.'\n\nMeanwhile, during a training session with France on Thursday, Mbappe met with fans, and even signed one lucky person's Real shirt - a sure-fire sign that this deal will be finalised shortly.\n\nLast week, it was also reported that the relationship between PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and the departing Mbappe remains strong, despite claims that a rift had emerged over the terms of his departure as a free agent.\n\nBoth the club and the player have previously stated there is an agreement in place that respects PSG's huge investment in Mbappe's development as a player since his \u00a3166m move from Monaco in 2017.\n\nMbappe won the Coupe de France in his final match for PSG, ending his last

After months of speculation, the French forward will join the Spanish giants on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain. Here's an in-depth look at the details of Mbappe's contract and what this move means for both the player and the club.\n\nLucrative contract and signing bonus\n\nMbappe, 25, has agreed to a five-year contract with Real Madrid, where he will earn a staggering \u20ac15 million ($16.2 million) per year after taxes. This deal cements his status as one of the highest-paid players in the world. In addition to his annual salary, Mbappe will receive a massive \u20ac150 million signing-on fee, which will be spread over the duration of his contract. This financial package underscores Real Madrid's commitment to securing the services of a player who has been a top target for several years.\n\nMbappe's move to Madrid has been a long time coming. The forward nearly joined the Spanish club when he left Monaco in 2017 and again in 2022, but on both occasions, he opted to remain at PSG. Now, with his contract at PSG expiring, Mbappe finally makes his dream move to the Bernab\u00e9u. His arrival in Madrid is seen as a pivotal moment for both the player and the club, as he seeks to elevate his career to new heights with one of the most prestigious teams in football history.\n\nCurrently on international duty with France for the European Championship, Mbappe is expected to be presented at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium after the tournament concludes. During a recent conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron at France's training camp, Mbappe hinted that the official announcement from Real Madrid would be made on Monday evening.\n\nReal Madrid's ambitious plans\n\nReal Madrid is riding high after an incredible season, having secured both the Champions League and LaLiga titles. They clinched their 15th European Cup with a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. The addition of Kylian Mbappe to an already formidable squad is a statement of intent as they aim to build on their recent successes. Meanwhile, Mbapp\u00e9's former club, PSG, managed to win Ligue 1 but fell short in the Champions League semifinals.\n\nWith his arrival, Mbappe is expected to play a central role in Real Madrid's future ambitions. Known for his incredible speed, dribbling skills, and goal-scoring prowess, he will add a new dimension to Madrid's attack. His partnership with other star players is anticipated to create one of the most formidable offensive line-ups in football.\n\nWhat's next for Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid\n\nAs Mbappe prepares to join Real Madrid, fans eagerly await his debut in the famous white jersey. The expectations are high, but Mbappe has consistently shown that he can thrive under pressure. His performances in LaLiga and the Champions League will be closely watched as he aims to help Real Madrid continue their dominance in European football.\n\nReal Madrid's acquisition of Kylian Mbappe is not just a transfer; it's a statement. It reflects the club's ambition to remain at the pinnacle of world football and provides Mbappe with the platform to achieve his personal and professional goals. As the new season approaches, all eyes will be on the Bernab\u00e9u to see how this new chapter unfolds.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kylian-Mbappes-Real-Madrid-earnings-and-contract-details-revealed.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

HERE WE GO.\n\n'The saga is finally over. Kylian Mbappe joins Real Madrid as a free agent at the end of the season.\n\n'The contract has been signed, the announcement will be really soon, in the next weeks, but Real Madrid will have one more star in their squad.\n\n'Kylian Mbappe joins from PSG and it's an historic HERE WE GO.'\n\nA move to the Bernabeu will finally end the speculation that has followed Mbappe throughout his career.\n\nThe French superstar has been chased by Real throughout his career in a long-running saga\n\nDespite the constant speculation, Mbappe scored 44 goals in 48 games over the season\n\nIt was reported in February that Real - who won the Champions League on Saturday - had reached an agreement with Mbappe that would see the forward join on a free transfer in the summer, with an \u00a385.5million signing-on fee, meaning the Spanish giants will get their man after a seven-year pursuit.\n\nNo official announcement has been forthcoming, but Mbappe explained back in March that one would be made ahead of Euro 2024 in Germany this summer, where he will captain France.\n\n'People will know my future before the Euros. I'm very calm about it,' he had told Telefoot.\n\n'My future is no longer a huge topic at the club, no one talks to me about it anymore.\n\n'I'll be at the Euros with calm head, ready to do great things.'\n\nDespite his exit from PSG being expected from as far back as last summer, Mbappe only officially announced he would be leaving on Friday, May 10 as he shared a heartfelt message to the club's fans.\n\n'I wanted to speak to you. I've always said that I would speak with you when the time comes, and so I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain,' he said.\n\n'I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks.\n\nThe 25-year-old leaves as PSG's all-time record goalscorer, having netted 256 times in Paris\n\n'I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. It's a lot of emotion; many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club - one of the best in the world - which allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure.\n\n'To grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history - some of the greatest champions; to meet a lot of people, to grow as a man as well, with all the glory and the mistakes I've made.\n\n'It's hard, and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that, to leave my country, France, Ligue 1, a championship I have always known, but I think I needed this - a new challenge after seven years.'\n\nMeanwhile, during a training session with France on Thursday, Mbappe met with fans, and even signed one lucky person's Real shirt - a sure-fire sign that this deal will be finalised shortly.\n\nLast week, it was also reported that the relationship between PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and the departing Mbappe remains strong, despite claims that a rift had emerged over the terms of his departure as a free agent.\n\nBoth the club and the player have previously stated there is an agreement in place that respects PSG's huge investment in Mbappe's development as a player since his \u00a3166m move from Monaco in 2017.\n\nMbappe won the Coupe de France in his final match for PSG, ending his last season at the club with 44 goals in 48 appearances in all competitions.\n\nMbappe is set to add significant firepower to a Real team who enjoyed a brilliant campaign\n\nMbappe is currently preparing for Euro 2024 with France, where he will captain the side\n\nThe French star then threw a farewell party for 250 guests in Paris, as his former PSG team-mates bid goodbye to him after seven years on

Real Madrid announce blockbuster Kylian Mbappe signing; details of deal with French star here", "body": "Real Madrid officially announced the signing of French sensation and former Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe, putting an end to a long saga of transfer rumors.\n\nIn a move that has been years in the making, Real Madrid has finally secured the signing of French superstar Kylian Mbappe. The announcement follows Real Madrid's triumphant 15th UEFA Champions League victory, adding another jewel to their illustrious crown.\n\nMadrid said on Monday that Mbappe agreed to a five-year contract at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nMbappe had announced his desire to leave French champions Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at the end of the 2023-24 season in May after verbally agreeing to move to Los Blancos. The France international left PSG after seven years in which he scored 256 goals in 308 appearances to become the highest scorer in the Ligue 1 club's history.\n\nReports said that Mbappe, who joined the La Liga giants on a free transfer after deal with PSG ended on June 30, is expected to receive around 100 million euros as signing bonus. Mbappe, who has signed a five-year contract with Real Madrid, is reported to receive 15 million euros a year after tax.\n\nReal Madrid have admired Mbappe for long and came close to signing the Frenchman in 2022, but the former PSG star signed a 2-year contract extension with PSG after prolonged negotiations. Mbappe did not activate a one-year contract extension with PSG, allowing him to walk free of cost after the French giants had shelled out 166 million pounds to Monaco.\n\nAccording to reports, the announcement will not be followed by an immediate presentation of the 25-year-old star. Marca's report indicates that Mbappe's grand introduction to the Santiago Bernabeu faithful will occur in July, promising a record-breaking event at the sold-out stadium.\n\nThe reason behind the delay in Mbappe's presentation is his current commitment to the French national team, which is gearing up for the upcoming European Championships. France will face Luxembourg and Canada in friendly matches before heading to Germany for the month-long competition starting on June 15. The 2018 World Cup champions, one of the favourites for the Euros, are set to face Poland, the Netherlands, and Austria in a highly competitive Group D.\n\nEarlier, Mbappe reportedly confirmed the imminent announcement to French President Emmanuel Macron. During a routine visit to the French national team camp, President Macron engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Mbappe, which was captured by RMC cameras. When the president inquired about the timing of the announcement, the French sensation responded confidently, \"Tonight, tonight.\"\n\nThis transfer marks a significant milestone in Real Madrid's storied history, as Mbappe joins a roster that already boasts immense talent. The 25-year-old forward will be in good company with fellow Real Madrid stars Vinicius Junior, Rodrigo, Jude Bellingham, Eduardo Camavinga and more.\n\nThe excitement surrounding Mbappe's move to Real Madrid has electrified both the club's supporters and the footballing world at large. The French forward's exceptional skill, speed, and scoring ability make him a perfect fit for the Spanish giants, who are aiming to further cement their dominance in European football.\n\nAs the official announcement is out, fans now eagerly await the formal confirmation and subsequent presentation of Kylian Mbappe in the iconic white jersey of Real Madrid. This blockbuster signing not only signals a new era for the club but also sets the stage for Mbappe to continue his ascent as one of the world's premier football talents.", "source": {"uri":

Florentino Perez gets emotional: There is someone to thank!\n\nThe announcement that every Real Madrid fan has been waiting for over the past seven years finally arrived. This time it was no fake or social media montage: \"Kylian Mbappe is a new player for Real Madrid,\" declared the club on its website, causing a global sensation.\n\nThis is one of the most high-profile and impactful signings in the history of football and possibly sports. The announcement came just a few days after Real Madrid secured their 15th Champions League title, marking a monumental moment for the club.\n\nThe signing of Kylian Mbappe by Real Madrid is the epitome of a saga, filled with ups and downs, love and heartbreak, culminating in a happy ending for the club. The French superstar and Real Madrid have signed a five-year contract, keeping him at the club until 2029.\n\nThe journey to Mbappe's signing began nearly two years ago, shortly after he left Real Madrid at the altar in May 2022. Under immense pressure from Paris, France, and Qatar, Mbappe renewed his contract with PSG just when Real Madrid had everything ready to welcome him.\n\nDespite the disappointment, reconciliation quickly followed, laying the groundwork for the signing this summer. Florentino Perez, the president of Real Madrid, secured Mbappe, who worked diligently to ensure his freedom by June 30, 2024, a year earlier than initially agreed with PSG.\n\nFlorentino Perez and Mbappe executed a flawless strategy last summer to finalize the signing of the century. Perez made PSG uneasy by denying any ongoing negotiations, while Mbappe remained resolute in his decision not to extend his contract with PSG. This impeccable plan ultimately brought Mbappe to the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nAnother effort was made in 2021, but PSG rejected a 200 million euro offer. In 2022, without negotiations, Mbappe renewed with PSG under significant pressure. Finally, on the fourth attempt, and just when many Madrid fans had resigned to the idea that he might never wear the white jersey, Mbappe joins Real Madrid.\n\nMbappe joins a champion team with far better economic conditions than he would have had in 2022. His ambition is to win everything with his new club, eyeing the Champions League and the Ballon d'Or.\n\nAlready a World Cup winner and a finalist in another with France, Mbappe's next step is to succeed at the club level, and he believes Real Madrid is the perfect stage to achieve this. Real Madrid, for its part, now has its new Galactico, a game-changing player both on and off the field.\n\nThe club enters a new dimension, bringing together stars like Bellingham, Vinicius, and Mbappe in the world's best stadium.

The German side defeated Mbappe\u00b4s PSG in the semi-finals but despite being outplayed, Madrid managed to escape from London with yet another Champions League trophy.\n\nSigning for the new Spanish and European champions will give Mbappe the greatest chance of winning silverware and the game\u00b4s top individual awards in the years to follow. Mbappe has seemed destined to join Real Madrid for years, coming close on multiple occasions but this time it will finally come to fruition.\n\nThe France captain announced he would be leaving PSG on May 10 at the end of his contract, and since then Madrid fans have been waiting to celebrate the official announcement, which should arrive early next week, a source close to negotiations has told AFP.\n\nStreet vendors around the Santiago Bernabeu have been selling Mbappe scarves and shirts for months, with anticipation steadily rising in the Spanish capital. Mbappe signed a Real Madrid fan\u00b4s shirt earlier this week while training with France, another nod towards his impending switch.\n\nAs a child growing up in Paris suburb Bondy, Mbappe had numerous posters of Real Madrid\u00b4s all-time top goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo on his walls. Mbappe\u00b4s dream move has taken a long time to come to fruition, with Madrid first attempting to lure him in 2017, when he signed for PSG from Monaco.\n\nEven the last few weeks have dragged, with Madrid wanting to announce the deal after the Champions League final, to avoid distractions. Madrid president Florentino Perez also tried to lure Mbappe to the club in 2021 and 2022, and he will finally get his way.\n\nConquering the biggest trophy in club football before capturing the game\u00b4s most prized asset days later is a demonstration of Madrid\u00b4s power. Questions over exactly how Mbappe will fit in at Madrid can be chewed on by fans at length over the summer.\n\nBoth the French forward and Vinicius Junior prefer to play coming in off the left flank, while Mbappe\u00b4s arrival could also see new Madrid star Jude Bellingham pushed into a deeper role. However Madrid\u00b4s stars are excited to welcome the forward to the club.\n\n\"I always want to play with the best players in the world,\" said Vinicius last week. \"Kylian Mbappe, what a player, who wouldn\u00b4t want to play with someone as good as him?\" remarked Bellingham.\n\nMbappe is touted to sign a five-year deal with Madrid at a much lower wage than he earned at Qatari-owned PSG but still become the club\u00b4s highest paid star, above Bellingham and Vinicius.\n\nThe forward may also rake a higher percentage of his image rights earnings than Madrid are accustomed to agree with their stars, typically a 50-50 split.

He arrived with us as a teenager, and now he is a big man, the best player in the world, and I wish him all the best,\" Al-Khelaifi said, speaking at the Globe Soccer Awards Europe held last week.\n\nMbappe spent seven years at PSG after signing from AS Monaco in 2017.

The move sees the European champions secure their newest \"Galactico,\" adding a formidable talent to their squad.\n\n\"Real Madrid C. F. and Kylian Mbappe have reached an agreement whereby he will be a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons,\" the Spanish champions said in a statement, fresh off their 15th European Cup triumph.\n\nThe 25-year-old captain of the French national team had announced he was leaving Paris St Germain in a video posted on social media platform X on May 10.\n\nMbappe will officially join Real Madrid in July after his PSG contract expires on June 30. However, before joining the club, he will be unveiled as a Real Madrid player, and then he will join up with the France squad for the European Championship in Germany.\n\nMbappe joins a star-studded side in Madrid, featuring Ballon d'Or favorites Vinicius Jr. and Jude Bellingham, under the management of Italian Carlo Ancelotti, the most successful coach in Champions League history with five titles.\n\nDespite winning numerous trophies at PSG, including domestic doubles and trebles, Mbappe has yet to clinch the Champions League, the only major honor missing from his impressive resume.\n\nAfter seven years at PSG, during which he won six Ligue 1 titles and four French Cups, Mbappe leaves the club as their all-time top scorer with 256 goals.\n\nMbappe surprised PSG last year when he informed them he would not take up the option of a one-year contract extension, leading to a standoff with the club before eventually being reinstated to the first-team squad.\n\nBy allowing Mbappe to run down the final year of his contract, PSG was unable to recoup any of the 180 million euro ($195.95 million) transfer fee they paid in 2017 to sign him from AS Monaco.\n\nMbappe became the second-most expensive player of all time after his former PSG teammate Neymar, who was signed for 222 million euros from Barcelona in 2017.\n\nReal Madrid had previously attempted to sign Mbappe but failed to do so, with Mbappe opting to sign a contract extension with PSG in May 2022 after Real Madrid's bid was rejected.\n\nWith Mbappe finally joining their ranks, Real Madrid aims to consolidate their dominance in LaLiga, having won the title by 10 points last season with only one loss, and remaining unbeaten in the Champions League.\n\n(With Reuters inputs)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Nobody can understand how excited I am right now. Can't wait to see you, Madridistas, and thanks for your unbelievable support.\n\n'\u00a1Hala Madrid!'\n\nNaturally, reports of a deal already having been signed with Real emerged on Sunday after claims an agreement had been reached months ago, with Monday's announcement the final confirmation of a move that will surprise few football fans.\n\nThe official announcement comes in the wake of Los Blancos' latest European crown, and sees him join the forward line of a side dripping with superstar quality.\n\nMbappe will line up next season alongside the likes of Ballon d'Or contenders Vinicius Jnr and Jude Bellingham, as well as Brazil star Rodrygo Goes and fellow new boy Endrick, widely regarded as perhaps the greatest wonderkid on the planet.\n\nWhile Real Madrid's already embarrassing array of talent now reaches a whole new plane, it does hand Carlo Ancelotti something of a headache.\n\nHis side have romped to a 15th Champions League title - as well as the Supercopa and LaLiga crowns to boot - powered by goals from Vinicius Jnr and Rodrygo, with Bellingham playing in behind.\n\nVinicius Jnr has been the star in terms of his goal contributions with 24 strikes and 11 assists, but he currently occupies that left wing spot that Mbappe features in.\n\nTherefore, one of those would have to move into the middle or over to the right in a less natural position in order to both play, with No 9 Endrick also needing minutes to progress his development.\n\nMbappe is also regarded as a player with a sizeable ego that comes with the territory of being arguably the best player in the world, giving Ancelotti a tough decision to make on how to keep everyone happy.\n\nThough he arrives on a free deal, reports in February claimed that the player would be handed a whopping \u00a385.5million as a signing on fee - \u00a3200,000 more than the world record price Los Blancos paid for Gareth Bale in 2013.\n\nMbappe's arrival comes at a curious point in the season, with France building up to the European Championship in Germany this summer; big transfer deals ordinarily come after major tournaments, rather than beforehand.\n\nMbappe will line up with the likes of Jude Bellingham (left), Vinicius Jnr (centre) and Rodrygo Goes (right) next term\n\nMbappe put out a video on his social media channels to bid farewell to PSG supporters\n\nCarlo Ancelotti now has a positive selection headache in trying to fit Mbappe into his team\n\nHowever, the player promised that his future would become clear ahead of the competition months ago, telling Telefoot: 'People will know my future before the Euros. I'm very calm about it.\n\n'My future is no longer a huge topic at the club, no one talks to me about it anymore.\n\n'I'll be at the Euros with calm head, ready to do great things.'\n\nHe also put out an official statement with an emotional farewell video for PSG fans ahead of their final games of the season.\n\n'I wanted to speak to you. I've always said that I would speak with you when the time comes, and so I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain,' he said.\n\n'I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks.\n\n'I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. It's a lot of emotion; many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club - one of the best in the world - which allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure.\n\n'To grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history - some of the greatest champions; to meet a lot of people, to grow as a man as well, with all the glory and the mistakes I've made.\n\nMbappe posed with a fan in a Real Madrid shirt at France training ahead of the Euros\n\nMbappe's announcement comes less than 48 hours after the club won the Champions League\n\nMbappe is currently preparing for Euro 2024 with France, where he will captain the side\n\n'It's hard, and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that, to leave my country, France, Ligue 1, a championship I have always known, but I think I needed this - a new challenge after seven years.'\n\nFans were, however, heard booing his name as it was read out ahead of their final home game of the season, which ended with defeat by Toulouse, though the Frenchman did get on the scoresheet.\n\nFrench outlet L'Equipe reported on Friday that Mbappe was set to be unveiled as a new Real Madrid player on Monday, less than 48 hours after their Champions League final triumph over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley.\n\nMeanwhile, during a training session with France on Thursday, Mbappe met with fans, and even signed one lucky person's Real Madrid shirt - a sure-fire sign that this deal will be finalised shortly.\n\nIt was also reported in May that the relationship between PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and the departing Mbappe remains strong, despite claims that a rift had emerged over the terms of his departure as a free agent.\n\nBoth the club and the player have previously stated there is an agreement in place that respects PSG's huge investment in Mbappe's development as a player since his \u00a3166m move from Monaco in 2017.\n\nMbappe won the Coupe de France in his final match for PSG, ending his last season at the club with 44 goals in 48 appearances in all competitions.\n\nIt is thought Mbappe's relationship with PSG club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi (right) is solid despite reports of a fall out\n\nThe French captain leaves PSG as their record goal scorer with 256 in 308 appearances over seven years\n\nThe French star then threw a farewell party for 250 guests in Paris, as his former PSG team-mates bid goodbye to him after seven years on their books.\n\nMbappe leaves as PSG's all-time record goalscorer, having scored 256 goals in 308 appearances over seven years in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This time, things have gone much more smoothly, and there is great excitement among everyone at Madrid over the arrival of one of the world's best players, especially with the squad that just won the club's 15th European Cup/Champions League already brimming with young talent.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the free-agent transfer has been without intrigue -- and nor was it totally unopposed.\n\nThis is the full story of how Madrid finally signed Mbappe.\n\nThe start of 2024 marked the beginning of the end.\n\nIn early January, at Madrid's Valdebebas training complex -- where the club's offices are also located -- it was agreed that a final attempt to sign Mbappe would be made.\n\nSeveral meetings were held on the matter, but some senior figures at Madrid were not convinced it was a good idea.\n\nThe thinking behind this was two-fold. First of all, there were concerns the club's interests could be damaged again after Mbappe's rejection two years ago. Others simply thought the time was not right -- for both sporting and economic reasons.\n\nSome preferred to be more cautious with the club's finances -- which are in good shape, even with the extensive remodelling of their Santiago Bernabeu stadium, which will cost at least \u20ac1.3billion (\u00a31.1bn; $1.4bn at current rates).\n\nSome thought the positive dressing-room atmosphere could be affected by Mbappe entering as the highest-paid player when the vast majority of his new team-mates had won more trophies for the club. Some thought Madrid could get by fine without him -- especially with 17-year-old Brazilian Endrick set to arrive and the team already performing admirably.\n\nIn short: there was a view that Madrid's project was working really well without Mbappe.\n\nBut club president Florentino Perez decided nonetheless that another attempt would be made, with the above factors taken into account. It was also decided that Mbappe would be given a deadline to respond to this new proposal, the terms of which would be lower than the one in 2022. According to sources familiar with those previous talks -- like all sources cited in this article, they preferred to speak anonymously to protect relationships -- Mbappe was offered a six-season contract with a \u20ac130million signing bonus and a salary of \u20ac26m a year.\n\nMbappe took a first step of his own on January 3 when, without consulting PSG, he stopped to speak with reporters after PSG beat Toulouse in the Trophee des Champions -- a game between the previous season's winners of Ligue 1 and the French Cup, much like the Community Shield in England.\n\n\"In 2022, I didn't know my decision until May,\" Mbappe said in reply to questions about his future -- it being the start of a new year, he was now into the final six months of his contract and free to negotiate with interested clubs.\n\n\"If I know what I want to do, I shouldn't let the decision drag on. It wouldn't make any sense.\"\n\nMeanwhile, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said the club wanted him to stay: \"He is the best player in the world, and the best thing for him is PSG. He is at the heart of the project. I ask everyone to leave Kylian in peace.\"\n\nMbappe's words were interpreted positively in the Spanish capital, where Madrid were already working on the detail of their offer. When what they were proposing reached the player's entourage in the following days, the club made it known that his salary (the offer was for slightly more than Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham were getting) and signing fee would make him their best-paid player.\n\nPerez was in regular contact with Mbappe during this process, something that is unusual for Madrid's club president. Ordinarily, his right-hand man, their director general Jose Angel Sanchez, conducts negotiations. Mbappe told Perez he was keen on the move. All the while Madrid insisted, through briefings to the media, that they had no interest in the player. But the reality was quite different -- as The Athletic reported on numerous occasions.\n\nSanchez travelled to Paris before Madrid took part in the four-club Supercopa de Espana tournament, which was played in Saudi Arabia from January 10-14. He returned full of optimism -- another good sign, as he is usually cautious and very restrained.\n\nBy the end of that month, everyone at Madrid believed a deal would be done. But still there was no definitive agreement. Some people close to Mbappe were not as clear on the move as he was.\n\nAs reported by The Athletic in mid-February, influential members of his entourage were unconvinced by the offer because it was below what he was making at PSG, and could earn from another potential suitor.\n\nIn talks with Perez, the president outlined how signing for Madrid would take the player's profile to another sporting and marketing level, which would help bring in further personal revenue. With a few exceptions such as Vinicius Jr, the split at Madrid over image rights is usually 50 per cent for the club and 50 per cent for the player, although the share for Mbappe is expected to be in his favour.\n\nSources at PSG still felt it was likely that Mbappe would leave. They recalled how he had already decided last summer against taking up an option to stay for an extra year, and knew he had repeatedly expressed admiration for Madrid.\n\nBut these sources also explained that PSG felt \"protected economically\". They described an agreement in principle with Mbappe that would see the club compensated financially if he did leave following the expiry of his contract on June 30. They said it was a complex arrangement that covered several scenarios -- including the France captain waiving certain loyalty bonuses he might otherwise have been entitled to. Mbappe himself has also talked of \"all parties being protected\" when he leaves, and discussions on this aspect are still ongoing.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly what agreement, if any, Mbappe and PSG make in this regard. But the French champions have always sought to stress that any departure for the forward at the end of the 2023-24 season would not be a 'free transfer' in their eyes.\n\nThen came a key development.\n\nOn February 13, a Tuesday, Real Madrid played away against RB Leipzig in the first leg of a Champions League last-16 tie. Senior club figures travelled with inside information. They had been told Mbappe would inform PSG of his decision to depart at the end of the season.\n\nThe news did not become public until the Thursday, but with the Madrid squad still in Germany, the club's board informed head coach Carlo Ancelotti. Without being told whether or not Mbappe had actually signed a contract, the Italian was made to understand that he could count on having the striker in his squad for next season.\n\nAbout 10 days later, Mbappe was spotted on Spanish soil, but in Barcelona not Madrid, enjoying a few days off. One source told The Athletic he had gone to the capital first to sign his contract.\n\nOnly this week, in early June, did two more sources share further information on the February talks. They said this was when Mbappe's move was sealed.\n\nThe final stages of negotiations were conducted in utmost secrecy. Madrid do tend to operate this way, but sources involved in the deal also said Mbappe's mother and agent Fayza Lamari requested there be no leaks at all, in order for her son to be as protected as possible during his final months with PSG.\n\nSome tensions between Mbappe and PSG followed, with manager Luis Enrique occasionally substituting him or leaving him out altogether. \"We have to get used to playing without him,\" the Spaniard said in March.\n\nAfter being replaced at half-time of a goalless draw away to Monaco, his first professional club, on March 1, Mbappe sat in the stands with his family instead of on the bench with team-mates. Watching the rest of the match just a few rows away were members of the PSG board, and reports said there was a heated conversation between them and his mum. Madrid and the player's camp believe PSG penalised Mbappe by reducing his playing time. Sources at the French club dismiss this as untrue.\n\nThe end was drawing near, but the fact both PSG and Madrid were still competing in the Champions League added to the strategy of total discretion. Three days after PSG were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals, however, Mbappe made his decision to leave public.\n\n\"I need a new challenge after seven years,\" he said, while thanking almost everyone at the club (most notably, Al-Khelaifi was not mentioned), but they did not know it was coming.\n\nMbappe wanted to make the announcement before PSG's final home game of the season on Sunday, May 12. The club decided not to organise anything special for him, but the team's ultras (with whom Mbappe had shared a barbecue on the Friday) dedicated a huge tifo to him.\n\nThe following Monday, newspaper Le Parisien reported that, in the run-up to the game, Al-Khelaifi and Mbappe had an argument, with the former reproaching the latter for not mentioning him in his farewell video.\n\nA PSG source strongly denied this happened, adding that an agreement with Mbappe over the economic terms of his departure was almost done.\n\nLater that Monday, Mbappe was named Ligue 1's player of the year for a fifth consecutive season. In his acceptance speech, he did acknowledge Al-Khelaifi, who in 2021, 2022 and 2023 repeated that his star player would not leave PSG for free.\n\n\"The new chapter will be very exciting,\" Mbappe said of his next move, without revealing the identity of his next club. \"Maybe it's not the time (for everyone) to find out.\"\n\nThe big reveal was always expected to come after the Champions League final, this past Saturday. Madrid did not want anything, not even the biggest signing they have ever made, to distract attention from something so important and difficult to achieve.\n\nEarly on Monday, two days after the club won a record-extending 15th European Cup/Champions League title, The Athletic reported the announcement would be made this week.\n\nNow it is finally done -- and fans can excitedly look forward to seeing Mbappe in that famous white kit.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mario_cortegana@nytimes.com", "name": "Mario

Real for their part also wanted to wait for their season to be complete - which actually resulted in them sealing both the La Liga and Champions League crowns.\n\nIn May, HITC revealed that Mbappe and Real were discussing how the deal would be finalised and announced - as his dream move to Madrid edged close to completion.\n\n25-year-old Mbappe first spoke to Real Madrid aged just 11, which he was training at the famed French academy at Clairefontaine - indeed most of Europe recognised his abilities then, but at 14 he opted for Monaco.\n\nReal Madrid tried for him again when he left Monaco in 2017 - but the 18-year-old headed back to his hometown of Paris, as he became the most expensive teenager in footballing history as he cost \u00a3150million.\n\nMadrid have always maintained an interest in Mbappe and in the summer of 2022, it was widely expected that he would finally seal a move to the Spanish capital - but instead, he opted to sign a new extension at PSG, two-years with an option. But it was an option that needed to be agreed by both sides.\n\nAnd the option was to become particularly newsworthy as in the summer of 2023 as PSG notified the player of their decision to exercise their half, they were shocked when Mbappe confirmed he would not be taking his.\n\nPSG reacted furiously and he was dropped from the first-team squad and they tried to sell him to Saudi Arabia with Al-Hilal making a world-record bid - but Mbappe had no intention of moving anywhere other than Madrid.\n\nNow, Mbappe and Real Madrid have signed and sealed their deal, but what will that look like? HITC's Football Financial Expert Adam Williams fills us in on the major aspects of the deal and what it means for Real and Mbappe.\n\n\"In raw financial terms, the cash Real have saved in lieu of a transfer fee is mostly wiped out by Mbappe's astronomical signing bonus.\n\n\"But as that figure is being paid out over five years, it will be more modest than am upfront transfer fee of equivalent value in terms of how UEFA assesses financial fair play.\n\n\"With Real paying the player around \u00a325.6m per year out of that pot as well as \u00a312.8m salary, that equates to around \u00a338.4m per season which will be deducted from their FFP calculation.\n\n\"That's around a tenth of the club's total annual wage bill but, I would argue, still represents comparatively good value in the scope of their overall playing budget.\"\n\nMbappe has taken a pay-cut from PSG, but he is also in line to make big money off his own brand at Real.\n\n\"The Mbappe deal is unusual in one respect in that he is believed to have kept 80 per cent of his image rights, whereas Real have historically given their Galacticos a far more moderate cut.\n\n\"The specifics of their arrangement with Adidas menawhile are not known, but they probably get somewhere between 8-12 per cent of every unit sold.\n\n\"So while an Mbappe-inspired upswing in shirt sales might bank Real an extra few million per season, it won't move the dial a huge amount if you zoom out on the graph.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graeme_bailey@hitc.com", "name": "Graeme

EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify\n\nMbappe will line up next season alongside the likes of Ballon d'Or contenders Vinicius Jnr and Jude Bellingham, as well as Brazil star Rodrygo Goes and fellow new boy Endrick, widely regarded as perhaps the greatest wonderkid on the planet.\n\nRead More Jude Bellingham delivers his verdict on Kylian Mbappe's pending arrival at Real Madrid... as the former PSG star 'SIGNS a contract to join the Spanish giants'\n\nWhile Real Madrid's already embarrassing array of talent now reaches a whole new plane, it does hand Carlo Ancelotti something of a headache.\n\nHis side have romped to a 15th Champions League title - as well as the Supercopa and LaLiga crowns to boot - powered by goals from Vinicius Jnr and Rodrygo, with Bellingham playing in behind.\n\nVinicius Jnr has been the star in terms of his goal contributions with 24 strikes and 11 assists, but he currently occupies that left wing spot that Mbappe features in.\n\nTherefore, one of those would have to move into the middle or over to the right in a less natural position in order to both play, with No 9 Endrick also needing minutes to progress his development.\n\nMbappe is also regarded as a player with a sizeable ego that comes with the territory of being arguably the best player in the world, giving Ancelotti a tough decision to make on how to keep everyone happy.\n\nThough he arrives on a free deal, reports in February claimed that the player would be handed a whopping \u00a385.5million as a signing on fee - \u00a3200,000 more than the world record price Los Blancos paid for Gareth Bale in 2013.\n\nMbappe's arrival comes at a curious point in the season, with France building up to the European Championship in Germany this summer; big transfer deals ordinarily come after major tournaments, rather than beforehand.\n\nMbappe will line up with the likes of Jude Bellingham (left), Vinicius Jnr (centre) and Rodrygo Goes (right) next term\n\nMbappe put out a video on his social media channels to bid farewell to PSG supporters\n\nCarlo Ancelotti now has a positive selection headache in trying to fit Mbappe into his team\n\nHowever, the player promised that his future would become clear ahead of the competition months ago, telling Telefoot: 'People will know my future before the Euros. I'm very calm about it.\n\nRead More Kylian Mbappe 'SIGNS Real Madrid contract' ahead of joining the Spanish giants as a free agent - as French superstar gets set to bring an end to long-running transfer saga after PSG exit\n\n'My future is no longer a huge topic at the club, no one talks to me about it anymore.\n\n'I'll be at the Euros with calm head, ready to do great things.'\n\nHe also put out an official statement with an emotional farewell video for PSG fans ahead of their final games of the season.\n\n'I wanted to speak to you. I've always said that I would speak with you when the time comes, and so I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain,' he said.\n\n'I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks.\n\n'I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. It's a lot of emotion; many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club - one of the best in the world - which allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure.\n\n'To grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history - some of the greatest champions; to meet a lot of people, to grow as a man as well, with all the glory and the mistakes I've made.\n\nMbappe posed with a fan in a Real Madrid shirt at France training ahead of the Euros\n\nMbappe's announcement comes less than 48 hours after the club won the Champions League\n\nMbappe is currently preparing for Euro 2024 with France, where he will captain the side\n\n'It's hard, and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that, to leave my country, France, Ligue 1, a championship I have always known, but I think I needed this - a new challenge after seven years.'\n\nFans were, however, heard booing his name as it was read out ahead of their final home game of the season, which ended with defeat by Toulouse, though the Frenchman did get on the scoresheet.\n\nFrench outlet L'Equipe reported on Friday that Mbappe was set to be unveiled as a new Real Madrid player on Monday, less than 48 hours after their Champions League final triumph over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley.\n\nMeanwhile, during a training session with France on Thursday, Mbappe met with fans, and even signed one lucky person's Real Madrid shirt - a sure-fire sign that this deal will be finalised shortly.\n\nIt was also reported in May that the relationship between PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and the departing Mbappe remains strong, despite claims that a rift had emerged over the terms of his departure as a free agent.\n\nBoth the club and the player have previously stated there is an agreement in place that respects PSG's huge investment in Mbappe's development as a player since his \u00a3166m move from Monaco in 2017.\n\nMbappe won the Coupe de France in his final match for PSG, ending his last season at the club with 44 goals in 48 appearances in all competitions.\n\nIt is thought Mbappe's relationship with PSG club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi (right) is solid despite reports of a fall out\n\nThe French captain leaves PSG as their record goal scorer with 256 in 308 appearances over seven years\n\nThe French star then threw a farewell party for 250 guests in Paris, as his former PSG team-mates bid goodbye to him after seven years on their books.\n\nMbappe leaves as PSG's all-time record goalscorer, having scored 256 goals in 308 appearances over seven years in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

No player born later than 1987 has ever won the award, but that is likely to change this year as stars of the new generation - including Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Bellingham, as well as Manchester City's Rodri and Erling Haaland - ascend to the top of the sport.\n\nMbappe wore the No 7 shirt at PSG but with Vinicius already occupying that number at Madrid, the new signing will presumably take up the vacant No 9 jersey worn by fellow Frenchman Karim Benzema for more than a decade before he departed for Saudi Arabia last summer.\n\nIf that is the case, Mbappe would follow a line of legendary Real Madrid players who wore No 9, including Alfredo di Stefano, Hugo Sanchez and Ronaldo Nazario.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [],

After leaving Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season, the 25-year-old forward is poised to join the Spanish giants on a free transfer.\n\nMbappe, who scored 256 goals in 308 appearances for PSG, will sign a five-year contract at the Santiago Bernabeu, earning \u00a312.8 million (\u20ac15 million) per year after tax. Real Madrid will pay the signing bonus in installments over the course of his contract. The club has been long-time admirers of Mbappe and previously attempted to sign him in 2022, but he chose to extend his stay at PSG for an additional two years, which has now expired.\n\nBy not activating a one-year extension in his PSG contract, Mbappe was able to move for free, six years after costing PSG \u00a3166 million.\n\nThe move sees Mbappe taking a pay cut from his previous \u20ac75 million (\u00a363.9 million) gross annual salary at PSG, where he also received a \u20ac30 million-a-year (\u00a325.6 million) signing-on bonus. His departure has freed up at least \u20ac220 million (\u00a3187.5 million) of gross costs for PSG.\n\nSpanish football journalist Semra Hunter expressed a collective sigh of relief among Real Madrid supporters, who have anticipated this move for several years. The transfer saga, which began when Mbappe was 11 and visited Real Madrid for a trial, has finally concluded. There is a sense of both excitement and apprehension among fans, given Mbappe's previous decision to stay in Paris in 2022, which left many disappointed.\n\nHunter also discussed how Mbappe might fit into Real Madrid's tactical setup. Under the assumption that manager Carlo Ancelotti sticks with a 4-4-2 formation, Mbappe and Vinicius Jr. could form a formidable two-pronged attack, supported by Jude Bellingham at the top of the midfield diamond. Alternatively, in a 4-3-3 setup, Mbappe could play centrally with Vinicius and Rodrygo on the wings, though this might require sacrificing a midfielder from Real Madrid's stacked roster.\n\nThe 2024 summer transfer window in the Premier League opens on June 14, coinciding with the start of Euro 2024, and closes on August 30 at 11 PM UK time. The dates align with other major European leagues following discussions with football associations across England, Germany, Italy, Spain, and France.", "source": {"uri": "pattayaone.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pattaya One News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://pattayaone.news/storage/2024/06/Kylian-Mbappe-to-Real-Madrid-85m-Bonus-and-Announcement-This-Week.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 2152, "textEnd": 2159}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-30", "textStart": 2215, "textEnd": 2224}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

While his salary might not be the highest at the club, Mbappe will also be paid an astronomical signing bonus worth \u00a3128m over five years.\n\nIt feels as if the transfer has been inevitable for years at this point, but finally, Kylian Mbappe will be a Real Madrid player. Fabrizio Romano confirmed that the 25-year-old was set to move to the 2024 Champions League winners on Sunday, with a formal announcement by the club now a matter of time.\n\nMadrid have admired the Frenchman for some time, and have tried to poach him from Paris Saint-Germain on a number of occasions. Although the move always fell through for one reason or another, Mbappe's intent not to renew his deal at the Parc des Princes meant that Los Blancos would have a clear run at one of the best strikers in the world.\n\nAdding him to an already stacked squad which includes the likes of Jude Bellingham and Vincius Junior makes Madrid even more feared than they were during the 2023/24 campaign, and Carlo Ancelotti's side will automatically be favourites in the majority of competitions they will compete in during 2024/25. But interestingly, despite his status in football, Mbappe will not earn substantially more than his teammates. He has, in fact, taken a very hefty pay cut as part of his move to the Santiago Bernabeu, and for a very important reason.\n\nHow Much Mbappe Will Earn at Real Madrid\n\nFrenchman's reported salary makes him the seventh-highest earner at the club\n\nAccording to Spanish football journalist, Guillem Balague, Mbappe is set to earn \u00a312.8m per season as a Madrid player. While that sounds like an incredible amount to most people, it roughly equates to around \u00a3246,154 every week. That, in comparison to his teammates, is very much in the middle of the park.\n\nBased on numbers from Capology, Mbappe will only be the seventh-highest earner at the Bernabeu based on that salary. He will earn less than the likes of Federico Valverde, Bellingham, and Vinicius. Toni Kroos is currently Madrid's highest earner, with the German taking home \u00a3403,487 per week, but he is set to retire after Euro 2024 and has played the final club game of his career. David Alaba will instead be the highest earner at the club next season, with the Austrian pocketing \u00a3372,373 a week.\n\nRelated Kylian Mbappe's Shirt Number and Position at Real Madrid Kylian Mbappe will join Real Madrid when his Paris Saint-Germain contract ends - and his likely shirt number has been revealed.\n\nAlthough Mbappe will not outrank everyone in terms of his weekly salary, he will also earn a huge amount from his signing bonus and other factors. Balague reports that he is set to receive a \u00a3128m bonus over the course of his five-year contract, while he will also keep a percentage of his image rights. Considering how high a profile he has within the game, that will ensure he continues to make a significant chunk of money.\n\nWhy Mbappe Will Earn Less at Madrid Than at PSG\n\nFabrizio Romano revealed the true reason in 2024\n\nHowever, even with all the added perks of his Real Madrid contract, Mbappe's salary is still going to be some distance behind what he was earning at PSG. Per The Athletic, the French international was earning an astonishing \u20ac200m (\u00a3171m) every year after he re-signed in the summer of 2021.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Per L'Equipe, Mbappe's PSG salary was worth roughly \u20ac6m a month, which meant he was earning \u20ac3.9m more a month than Harry Kane, the second-highest paid player in the world.\n\nThe reason for his yearly pay dropping exponentially, though, was revealed by Fabrizio Romano earlier in 2024. Speaking in an interview on the 'Mics' podcast, via Essentially Sports, the football transfer journalist said that the Madrid hierarchy were keen to bring Mbappe's salary in line with what was being paid to players already at the club. The feeling was that if his salary was much higher than everyone elses, it could disrupt the harmony of the squad.\n\n\"What I heard is that his salary is going to be in the region of the salary of Vinicius Jr. and Jude Bellingham not to create an internal problem. So, it's going to be something around \u20ac25m [$27m] net per season.\"\n\nImpressively, Madrid have managed to agree a deal with Mbappe worth even less than what was quoted by Romano. It arguably shows just how much he wanted to join the club.\n\nWhere Mbappe Will Play for Madrid\n\nStriker will partner Vinicius and Rodrygo in attack\n\nWhile bringing Mbappe to the club is one thing, figuring out exactly where he will play in Ancelotti's set-up is another thing altogether. Typically someone who lines up centrally but will drift out to the left during games, he might have to learn to stay in the middle of the park more often so that he doesn't take up the same positions as Vinicius, who is usually Madrid's left-winger.\n\nThere will be, however, an element of fluidity under Ancelotti, so don't be surprised to see the Brazilian and his new teammate interchanging during matches. That will also extend to Rodrygo, who lines up on the right side of attack for the current Champions League holders.\n\nRelated How Real Madrid Could Line Up if They Sign Kylian Mbappe With Kylian Mbappe leaving Paris Saint-Germain, the Real Madrid target could form a key part of the Spanish side's squad next season.\n\nWith Vinicius, Mbappe, and Rodrygo leading the line, and with two of Luka Modric, Bellingham, Aurelien Tchouameni or Valverde feeding balls through to them, there is every chance that this Madrid team will dominate world football for the next decade. They might have been the most impressive force on the continent for the last 10 years, but this feels like the start of something even more special.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_collins@givemesport.com", "name": "Luke Collins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Alaba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Alaba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Valverde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Valverde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-03-jun-2024-05-05-pm-3423.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Mbappe came close to joining Madrid again in 2022 before re-signing with PSG.\n\nHis five-year contract is worth \u20ac15 million ($16.4 million) a year after taxes, according to the BBC and ESPN. The deal includes further incentives based on individual and team performance and accolades. He will also receive a \u20ac150 million ($164 million) signing bonus that will be spread out over the life of the contract.\n\nMbappe's PSG contract ran through the 2023-24 season with a player option for the 2024-25 season. With Mbappe not triggering his option, he moves to Madrid on a free transfer.\n\nMbappe will take a pay cut to join Madrid, as he was earning roughly $100 million a year pre-tax at PSG, including bonuses. Last summer, Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal offered PSG \u20ac300 million ($327 million) for Mbappe and would have paid the forward hundreds of millions of dollars annually in salary, but he was not interested with a move to Madrid on his radar.\n\nMbappe spent seven seasons with PSG in Ligue 1 and helped the club finish first each year, while leading the league in goals the past six years and winning player of the year five times. He also helped France's national team to a World Cup title in 2018, winning the tournament's Best Young Player award, and won the 2022 World Cup's Golden Boot award in leading the French team to the final, where the squad lost on penalties to Argentina.\n\nPSG added Lionel Messi and Neymar to try to help the French club win its first Champions League title, but the superstar trio fell short of the goal with a 2020 Finals appearance its best showing. PSG lost in the semifinals this year, and Mbappe's departure marks the end of PSG's wild spending spree that triggered a $400 million loss during the 2021-22 season.\n\nOn Saturday, Real Madrid won its 15th Champions League title, more than double AC Milan, which is second with seven. Madrid ranked second in Sportico's recent look at the world's most valuable soccer clubs at $6.06 billion -- PSG was seventh at $4.05 billion.", "source": {"uri": "sportico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportico.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kurt_badenhausen@sportico.com", "name": "Kurt Badenhausen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Monaco_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AS Monaco FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hilal_SFC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Hilal SFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

They are finally coming together and hopefully it will be a harmonious union between Mbappe and Real Madrid.\n\n\"This saga has rumbled on for so long now that every single summer it was all about: 'Here we go again, is this finally the summer he is going to come?'\n\n\"Everybody knew it was inevitable that Mbappe was coming to Real Madrid. It was just a matter of when.\n\n\"Real Madrid have been trying for so many years, it even began when he was 11 years old when he went to the club for a trial with the Under-12s side. He decided not to stay because his parents felt he was better off staying in France to grow and develop.\n\n\"In 2017, that was the real first time they came in for him when he was at Monaco. It didn't work out as PSG came in and hijacked the deal. It's been on and off again for the last seven years. It really is happening this time.\n\n\"But there is also a little bit of apprehension about this deal because it was such a big blow in 2022 when Real really thought he was coming but he decided to snub them and stay in Paris. It left a lot of Madridistas very broken-hearted disappointed and angry - even people at the club as well.\"\n\nSpanish football journalist Semra Hunter to Sky Sports News:\n\n\"Ultimately it will depend on what Carlo Ancelotti wants to do from a tactical point of view.\n\n\"Yes, there is a pecking order of sorts but of course you are going to go with the best players that you have available too.\n\n\"Let's work under the premise that Ancelotti is going to stick with a 4-4-2 next season, with Jude Bellingham at the top of the midfield diamond, though really Bellingham can do whatever he wants on the pitch.\n\n\"That means Vinicius and Mbappe can start in a two-pronged attack, like what Vinicius and Rodrygo have been doing this season. Vinicius has really made the left hand side his. That is his best position. Rodrygo is more tactically flexible - he can play on the right, left or as a No 10.\n\n\"So there are lots of options. He could play 4-3-3 with Mbappe in the middle with Vinicius and Rodrygo on the wings. But that means he would have to sacrifice a midfielder and they are so stacked in that area, I don't see that happening too often.\"\n\nThe 2024 summer transfer window in the Premier League officially opens on Friday June 14 - the same day that Euro 2024 starts.\n\nThe window will close on August 30 at 11pm UK time.\n\nThe Premier League has brought forward Deadline Day to link up with the other major leagues in Europe. The closing dates were set following discussions with the leagues in England, Germany, Italy, Spain and France.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"},

Mbappe joins a young, star-studded squad containing Jude Bellingham, Vincius Jr, Rodrygo, Federico Valverde, Aurelien Tchouameni and Edouardo Camavinga, while Brazilian wonderkid Endrick is also poised to join the club this summer.\n\nMbappe leaves Paris Saint-Germain after seven years in the French capital, having joined from Monaco for \u00a3165m following an initial loan move. The 25-year-old claimed six league titles in Paris as well as several domestic cups, but failed to win the Champions League, losing the 2020 final to Bayern Munich.\n\nMbappe's goal will now be to win the trophy with which Madrid have become synonymous, having won six of the past 10 European titles.\n\nHe will also have eyes on finally landing the Ballon d'Or, the game's top individual prize which has been dominated for so long by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. No player born later than 1987 has ever won the award, but that is likely to change this year as stars of the new generation - including Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Bellingham, as well as Manchester City's Rodri and Erling Haaland - ascend to the top of the sport.\n\nMbappe wore the No 7 shirt at PSG but with Vinicius already occupying that number at Madrid, the new signing will presumably take up the vacant No 9 jersey worn by fellow Frenchman Karim Benzema for more than a decade before he departed for Saudi Arabia last summer.\n\nIf that is the case, Mbappe would follow a line of legendary Real Madrid players who wore No 9, including Alfredo di Stefano, Hugo Sanchez and Ronaldo Nazario.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [],

With an eye-watering signing-on fee worth between \u00a3103m-\u00a3128m set to be included, the forward's deal is expected to go down as one of the most lucrative in football history.\n\n12 months ago, Mbappe made his intentions clear by opting not to trigger a one-year extension clause in his contract with PSG, who in 2022 told supporters that the World Cup winner had committed his future for the next three years by snubbing an initial move to Madrid. Mbappe found himself sensationally put up for sale last summer after being left out of the club's pre-season squad, but Madrid stuck to their plan of signing him on a free in 2024.\n\nFootball's worst-kept secret, Los Blancos wanted to wait until their season was over before announcing Mbappe's arrival. Carlo Ancelotti's men went all the way in the Champions League, beating Borussia Dortmund 2-0 at Wembley in the final on Saturday to earn their 15th European crown.\n\nMadrid don't expect Mbappe to be available for his presentation until mid-July due to France's upcoming European Championship campaign. The 25-year-old will lead his country into a major tournament for the first time as captain, having been given the armband by manager Didier Deschamps last year.\n\nMbappe wears the No.10 shirt for France and wore No.7 for PSG, both of which are occupied by new team-mates Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior. He could therefore emulate Cristiano Ronaldo and wear No.9 in his first season at the Bernabeu, with the shirt being vacated by club legend Karim Benzema a year ago.\n\nYour turn! Has Kylian Mbappe made the right decision? Join the debate in the comments section\n\nParis-born Mbappe joined PSG from Monaco in 2017 for a staggering \u00a3166m, a fee which would've been enough to break the world record had the Ligue 1 giants not signed Neymar from Barcelona two weeks prior. Mbappe went on to score 235 goals in just 264 appearances, winning 15 trophies but failing to get his hands on the Champions League. Who better to join than Madrid, then?\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

They are finally coming together and hopefully it will be a harmonious union between Mbappe and Real Madrid.\n\n\"This saga has rumbled on for so long now that every single summer it was all about: 'Here we go again, is this finally the summer he is going to come?'\n\n\"Everybody knew it was inevitable that Mbappe was coming to Real Madrid. It was just a matter of when.\n\n\"Real Madrid have been trying for so many years, it even began when he was 11 years old when he went to the club for a trial with the U12s side. He decided not to stay because his parents felt he was better off staying in France to grow and develop.\n\n\"In 2017, that was the real first time they came in for him when he was at Monaco. It didn't work out as PSG came in and hijacked the deal. It's been on and off again for the last seven years. It really is happening this time.\n\n\"But there is also a little bit of apprehension about this deal because it was such a big blow in 2022, when Real really thought he was coming, but he decided to snub them and stay in Paris.\n\n\"It left a lot of Madridistas very broken-hearted, disappointed and angry - even people at the club as well.\"\n\nSpanish football journalist Semra Hunter:\n\n\"Ultimately it will depend on what Carlo Ancelotti wants to do from a tactical point of view.\n\n\"Yes, there is a pecking order of sorts but of course you are going to go with the best players that you have available.\n\n\"Let's work under the premise that Ancelotti is going to stick with a 4-4-2 next season, with Jude Bellingham at the top of the midfield diamond, though really Bellingham can do whatever he wants on the pitch.\n\n\"That means Vinicius and Mbappe can start in a two-pronged attack, like what Vinicius and Rodrygo have been doing this season.\n\n\"Vinicius has really made the left-hand side his. That is his best position. Rodrygo is more tactically flexible - he can play on the right, left or as a No 10.\n\n\"So there are lots of options. He could play 4-3-3, with Mbappe in the middle and Vinicius and Rodrygo on the wings. But that means he would have to sacrifice a midfielder and they are so stacked in that area. I don't see that happening too often.\"\n\nThe 2024 summer transfer window in the Premier League officially opens on Friday June 14 - the same day that Euro 2024 starts.\n\nThe window will close on August 30 at 11pm UK time.\n\nThe Premier League has brought forward Deadline Day to link up with the other major leagues in Europe.

The 2018 World Cup winner and standout star is PSG's record goal-scorer with 256 goals since he joined them from Monaco on an initial loan in 2017. He agreed a deal with Real until 2029, earning \u20ac15 million (\u00a312.8 million) a season, plus a \u20ac150 million (\u00a3128 million) signing-on bonus to be paid over five years, and he will keep a percentage of his image rights.\n\nMbappe will line up next season alongside the likes of Ballon d'Or contenders Vinicius Jnr and Jude Bellingham, as well as Brazil star Rodrygo Goes and fellow new boy Endrick. His new team-mates also include Luka Modric, with the Croatian midfielder set to sign a new one-year extension with the club.\n\nMbappe's official arrival is surprising timing as France are building up to the European Championship in Germany this summer. On Monday, he was left out by France head coach Thierry Henry's preliminary 25-man squad for the Olympic Games in Paris this summer, presumably due to conditions in his contract at Real.\n\nOn his Instagram page, Mbappe described the move as \"a dream come true\", posting pictures of himself as a youngster with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n\"So happy and proud to join the club of my dream,\" he said. \"Nobody can understand how excited I am right now. Can't wait to see you, Madridistas, and thanks for your unbelievable support.

It read: \"Real Madrid CF and Kylian Mbappe have reached an agreement whereby he will be a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons.\"\n\nThis deal has been a long time coming. Ever since Mbappe announced he would be leaving Paris Saint-Germain at the end of 2023/24, when his contract expired, it was expected that he would sign for Madrid. However, as long as that announcement never came, there was a degree of nervousness for fans around the world.\n\nNow, that's all in the past. Madrid and their supporters can celebrate June 2024 as a momentous month in their history, when they won a record-extending 15th UEFA Champions League trophy and signed arguably the best player in the world.\n\nMbappe was one of the highest-paid athletes in the world at PSG, and it has long been suggested he would have to take a pay cut in order to join Los Blancos. So, how much is he worth, and what is his new salary going to be?\n\nMORE: How will Mbappe fit into Real Madrid's team alongside Vinicius and Bellingham?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Mbappe's personal wealth totals $180 million.\n\nIn 2022, Forbes declared Mbappe the highest-paid footballer in the world, his new deal with PSG earning him around $128m that year. The revised figures published in October 2023 saw the France star drop to fourth, behind Neymar, Lionel Messi, and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nAccording to BBC Sport, Mbappe's Madrid contract is worth \u20ac15 million net per season, which works out at roughly \u20ac288,000 per week.\n\nThat's a huge drop-off from the \u20ac75m ($82.8m) net per year base salary he earned at PSG, but Madrid simply cannot match that level of wage. However, it has been reported that a signing fee of around \u20ac150m, payable over five years, will make up some of the shortfall.\n\nAs one of the world's finest football players, and given his relatively young age, Mbappe is a marketing dream.\n\nHe has long-standing partnerships with the likes of Nike and Hublot, and he became one of the youngest cover stars of EA Sports' FIFA game series back in 2020.\n\nIn early 2024, Forbes put the value of his endorsement deals at $20 million.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/GettyImages-2152092308.jpg?itok=2hQZoLb8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 45, "textEnd": 51}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

PSG reached the Champions League final in 2020 but finished runners-up to Bayern Munich and lost in the last-four stage during the current campaign to Borussia Dortmund, who were beaten 2-0 by Real Madrid on Saturday.\n\nLosing a world-class talent like Mbappe for nothing will sting the Parisians; Mbappe's reported signing on fee of \u20ac100 million will make him feel the wait was worthwhile.\n\nIt's fair to ask how a team that has just won a La Liga and European Cup double can improve but there are few doubts Mbappe will do just that.\n\nMadrid's win at Wembley on Saturday confirmed many known facts but also revealed some holes in their games that need addressing.\n\nReal's resolve, particularly in European competition, is embedded in its DNA. As well as being the continent's most decorated club, they are also its great survivors. They rode their luck at times but the white wall held firm to withstand a Dortmund onslaught. It felt inevitable that, once Dortmund failed to capitalise on their dominance, Madrid would punish them at some stage.\n\nWhat it also revealed is the team's need for a spearhead to lead the attack. Madrid's forays forward came almost exclusively from wide positions, an imaginary buffer zone operating the centre of the Wembley pitch whenever they were in the final third. The lack of a focal point was all the more obvious by how well Niclas Fullkrug fulfilled that particular role at the tip of Dortmund's attack.\n\nMbappe may not be a centre-forward in the conventional sense but his goalscoring record is the envy of most. He has made runs from wide left to centre - the kind Vinicius Jr also favours - his trademark, but Madrid are masters of taking talented players and molding them into a well-oiled machine.\n\nIron sharpens iron, as the saying goes. Cristiano Ronaldo became a better finisher learning under Gonzalo Higuain; Karim Benzema became a better striker after first earning his stripes alongside both. The churn at Real Madrid can be unforgiving, but the finished product is always sparking.\n\nMbappe's arrival gives coach Carlo Ancelotti even more attacking riches to play with. He can use both Mbappe and Vinicius in a two-pronged attack, ably supported by Jude Bellingham at the tip of a diamond in midfield, with Rodrygo potentially operating from a wide right position. Alternatively, he may opt for a 4-3-3, with Mbappe at centre-forward and Vinicius and Rodrygo causing havoc around him.\n\nThe latter means sacrificing a midfielder but it could be the preferred option while Ancelotti determines how to replace the irreplaceable Toni Kroos.\n\nThrow into the mix the 18-year-old Brazilian wunderkind Endrick, who moves to Madrid from Palmeiras this summer, and the job of making all the pieces fit is one Ancelotti and Madrid will relish.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We can love it or hate it, I made the choice of loving it.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\n\"And I did for seven years with ups and downs, of course, but I do not regret at any moment signing with this prestigious club.\n\n\"It's a club that I will keep in my memory my entire life. I will tell everybody, my whole life, that I had the chance to play here.\n\n\"And I won't be a player anymore, but I will continue to watch every game of course, because it's a club that I will always be interested in and I will always closely follow its news.\"\n\nHe added: \" I want to say thank you, because without you all I would have never experienced half of the emotions I felt.\n\n\"And just for that, I am grateful for life. Thank you all.\"\n\nThe goalscoring machine, who is widely considered to be one of the best players in the world, had come close to moving to Madrid back in 2022.\n\nReal Madrid seemed to have put everything in place to lure Mbappe to the Bernabeu on a free transfer, but ultimately missed out when the star penned a two-year extension at the Parc des Princes in an unexpected U-turn.\n\nThat deal has now expired meaning Mbappe can complete the move to join the La Liga champions.\n\nMbappe joins the club just days after they won their 15th Champions League title with a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley.\n\nThe former Monaco man joins the likes of Jude Bellingham, Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo and Luka Modric in a team of superstars.\n\nThe new breed of 'Galacticos' look set up to dominate European football for the foreseeable future.\n\nFor now though, Mbappe will shift his focus onto international football as he prepares for Euro 2024 with France this summer.", "source": {"uri":

If you would like to receive Fabrizio Romano's exclusive transfer news via email ahead of publication on caughtoffside.com, please sign-up for the service here: thedailybriefing.io\n\nKylian Mbappe to Real Madrid - here we go!\n\nAs reported yesterday, Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid is 'here we go' - every document is signed, and the French superstar can be considered a new Real Madrid player, joining the European champions as a free agent from Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nMbappe will be officially announced soon, it's being prepared by Real Madrid as they look to unveil the new star of their project. Even though Mbappe is technically still contracted to PSG until the end of this month, they have given the green light for Real Madrid to formally announce their new signing.\n\nThis deal has been in the works for some time, with Mbappe deciding back in February not to sign a new contract with PSG, while even a few months before that it was a tense situation between Mbappe and his club as he informed them he would not trigger the option to extend his contract for a further year until 2025, which was one of the options included when he signed his new deal with PSG back in 2022. At that time, however, even though he rejected Real Madrid, he spoke with Florentino Perez directly and apologised, making it clear his dream was always to wear the Real Madrid shirt. And now it's happening - Mbappe already has a house in Madrid and has prepared for his private life in the Spanish capital.\n\nAn important detail in all this - Mbappe will not be earning the kind of huge money that Real Madrid were offering in 2022. Money was not the crucial factor at that point as there was not a big difference between what Real Madrid were offering and what PSG were offering. Now Real Madrid have done an incredible job in terms of money as they're signing Mbappe as a free agent, though obviously it still won't be cheap, and now they've been very clear with Mbappe after he rejected them in the past: this is your last chance to join Real Madrid, and if you don't accept our terms with the salary and image rights, the deal can't happen.\n\nSo, Real Madrid will not pay Mbappe the same kind of money he had on the table from the club in 2022. It will be way less - still an important salary, but similar to what players like Vinicius, Jude Bellingham and other stars of the team are earning. There will be add-ons, of course, if he helps the team win La Liga, the Champions League, and more. He will also earn an important signing fee from Real Madrid in excess of \u20ac100m.\n\nReal Madrid players are really excited about the possibility to play with Mbappe - they are not jealous at all, they believe that Real Madrid have the best technical project in the world, and that what they're doing, step by step, is really special. Mbappe is joining, Endrick is joining, they are trusting their players even through injuries and difficult moments, and they want to win every single competition they're in.\n\nSo, what next for Real Madrid this summer? For now obviously the plan is to announce this historic Mbappe signing, and after that they want to sign the new deals for Luka Modric and Lucas Vazquez. Then we'll have to see what they decide to do as they have other interesting targets.\n\nOne name, as mentioned before, is Alphonso Davies. We'll have to see what happens on that as it's gone a bit quiet while we wait on the player's decision after Bayern Munich offered him a new contract. Leny Yoro also remains on their list but it will depend on what kind of price tag Lille ask for. 16-year-old River Plate wonderkid Franco Mastantuono is also being monitored.\n\nBruno Fernandes' agent meets with top clubs - can Man United keep him?\n\nThere's been a lot written again about the future of Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United, with the Portuguese press claiming that there have been some contacts with both Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and that approaches could come soon. There will inevitably be a lot written about this, so I wanted to clarify my current understanding of the situation here.\n\nThe reality is that Fernandes' agent Miguel Pinho has met with some European top clubs last week. Contacts took place, but the player remains focused on Man United and his exit is not something decided at this point. It will also depend on Man United's new project, what happens with the manager, what they will 'present' to Bruno in new meeting.\n\nIt's a stand-by moment between Fernandes and Man United, waiting to make final decision with a new contract for the player also being a possibility in case he decides to stay.\n\nPotential ins and outs at Barcelona under Hansi Flick\n\nIt's the beginning of a new era at Barcelona this summer after Hansi Flick replaced Xavi as manager, so what will this mean for some of the players in the squad he's inheriting? Already we're seeing some rumours about possible big names who could leave Barca, and signings that could come in, so I thought I'd respond to those here.\n\nOne name I've been asked about is Joshua Kimmich. Of course we know he has only one year left on his contract at Bayern, but for now he's 100% focused only on the Euros and no talks have taken place with other clubs. Flick appreciates Kimmich for sure, but concrete internal talks will start in the next days and the moment nothing is concrete on this deal yet.\n\nKimmich is being linked as we're also hearing speculation about another midfield player Ilkay Gundogan possibly leaving, with Galatasaray mentioned as being interested. However, I don't have this information at all - I've heard zero on this, with no contact between Galatasaray and Gundogan. We'll see what happens later in the window, but for now I am not aware of anything happening on this one.\n\nBarca also have a talented young defender in Mikayil Faye who continues to attract links with other clubs. Arsenal have been mentioned again by some media outlets, but nothing is close or advanced now as Barcelona still have to make a decision on Faye's future. Many clubs are interested in the 19-year-old, but it's too early to mention anything concrete or close now.\n\nFulham discuss potential Emile Smith Rowe move\n\nWe continue to hear reports of Arsenal outgoings, and one name now attracting particular interest is Emile Smith Rowe. I can confirm, as the Telegraph reported, that he is one of the names that Fulham mentioned internally during a meeting to plan for summer window.\n\nStill, it will be up to Arsenal also, as even in January they insisted to keep him. I think he deserves to play, he needs to play, but I understand Mikel Arteta when he wants to keep as many players as possible. Arsenal, like all clubs who are ambitious in the big competitions, will need good squad depth again next season, so let's see what happens.\n\nMike Maignan linked with Man City - what's the truth?\n\nAs I recently revealed, there are chances for Ederson to leave Manchester City this summer, so it's normal to now see goalkeepers being linked with the Premier League champions.\n\nHowever, despite links with AC Milan's Mike Maignan, I have no info yet on a new Manchester City goalkeeper, also because it will depend on what Ederson wants to do. At the moment it's too early to say. Many goalkeepers will be linked with Man City now, but I don't have anything confirmed yet.", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fabrizio_romano@caughtoffside.com", "name": "Fabrizio Romano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansi_Flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hansi Flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kimmich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Kimmich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Atl\u00e9tico_River_Plate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Maignan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Maignan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ederson_(footballer,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ederson (footballer, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile_Smith_Rowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emile Smith Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatasaray_S.K._(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galatasaray S.K.

The fact they then completed the signing of the world's most coveted footballer was quite the cherry on the cake.\n\nAt long, long last, Kylian Mbappe is a Real Madrid player. Having confirmed he would leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of his contract this year, it has long been anticipated that the France star would sign for the team he nearly joined two years ago. Now, the deal has been concluded.\n\nThe Sporting News runs through the key details of one of the most significant \"free\" transfers in history.\n\nMORE: The managers with the most titles in Champions League history\n\nOn June 3, Real Madrid announced that they had signed Kylian Mbappe on a five-year contract. Officially, it's a free transfer: the forward was a free agent following the expiry of his PSG contract.\n\nOf course, this deal still comes at a huge expense for the 15-time kings of Europe. According to BBC Sport, Mbappe's Madrid contract is worth \u20ac15 million net per season, which works out at roughly \u20ac288,000 per week.\n\nThat's a sizeable drop-off from his PSG earnings, but it's understandable.\n\nMbappe's base salary at the French champions was reportedly \u20ac75m net per year ($82.8m / \u00a364.4m), excluding bonuses. According to reports upon the signing of his new contract in 2022, including from the New York Times and The Guardian, Mbappe's new deal also earned him a \u20ac100m ($110.4m / \u00a385.9m) signing bonus just for agreeing to stay at the club.\n\nMadrid were never likely to get close to matching a weekly wage of more than \u20ac1.3m -- indeed, given financial rules imposed by both UEFA and La Liga, they would not be able to -- but it is believed that some of the shortfall in his new Madrid salary will be compensated for by a huge signing fee of around \u20ac150 million, which will be payable over the duration of his deal.\n\nMadrid have not yet confirmed what number will adorn the back of Mbappe's shirt. At PSG, he wore the No. 7, and he would likely want to wear the same in Spain to follow in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, one of his idols. However, Vinicius Junior occupies that jersey, and it seems very unlikely the club will ask him to give it up.\n\nThere is no incumbent No. 9 at Madrid, so that's likely to be Mbappe's jersey number in 2024/25. Diario AS reported the same back in March.\n\nMbappe's next duty is Euro 2024 with France, where he will attempt to win the trophy for the first time.\n\nHis debut game for Real Madrid will come during preseason. At the moment, their first friendly match is due to be against AC Milan at Soldier Field, Chicago, on July 31. Madrid would likely want Mbappe to be available for that opening preseason tour fixture.\n\nHis first competitive game for his new club is not yet known as La Liga has not released its fixture schedule for next season, although it could be that Mbappe plays in the UEFA Super Cup before the Spanish top flight: Madrid will face Europa League winners Atalanta in Warsaw, Poland on August 14.\n\nMORE: Trophies and awards won by Kylian Mbappe in stunning career\n\nMbappe, who signed for PSG from Monaco in a deal worth \u20ac180m in 2017, became the Ligue 1 side's record goalscorer during his seven years in Paris.\n\nIn six of his seven seasons, he scored at least 30 goals in all competitions.\n\nHere's a look at his goal-scoring total during his time at the Parc des Princes:", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diario_AS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diario AS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_football_league_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish football league system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Super Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Kylian Mbappe will be a Real Madrid player. The irony of this multi-year pursuit, and all the drama that followed, is that the talented Frenchman now arrives in his peak years, yet the team dynamic is at a point where he is least needed. This Real Madrid team is made up of a squad that lost just two games all season and achieved a historic double for the second time in three years. To put that success into context: over Real Madrid's illustrious 122-year history, it took them 59 years between their first double (1958) and their second (2017). Two doubles - La Liga and the Champions League - in three years mean there is a special group currently at the helm. There is hardly room for improvement, but improvement is what the Real Madrid faithful will demand.\n\nDuring those years of pursuit, club president Florentino Perez would be flagged down by fans and pleaded with to sign Mbappe, \"presi, presi ficha Mbappe\". It seemed inevitable, until it wasn't. Until Mbappe took part in a ceremony at PSG's home stadium, the Parc des Princes, holding an \"Mbappe 2025\" PSG shirt. The player shocked the world by renewing with his hometown club for what was reported as obscene amounts of money as well as sporting influence. A 23-year-old kid was put under immense political and financial pressure, a burden that swayed his decision. Few Madrid fans had issue with him renewing given the contract on offer, it was the manner in which he dragged out the saga, and the constant flirtation with the club, that left a bad taste in the mouth. Those psychological wounds mean the Frenchman will have work to do to repair the damage done with a portion of the Madrid fan base.\n\nLife moved on, and Real Madrid moved on. Vinicius exploded, Rodrygo developed, Benzema became god-like, Courtois was the best goalkeeper in the world, and the most talented young players continued to arrive: Camavinga, Tchouameni, Bellingham, Arda, and Endrick. The new Santiago Bernabeu morphed into an architectural and entertainment wonder. The club chugged along and continued to reach new heights without Mbappe.\n\nThe question now is, can even higher heights be hit or will Kylian upset the balance? On the one hand, when focused and in-form, there is arguably no greater threat in the final third in all of world football. He is the true definition of a generational talent with a skillset that could take this great team to yet another level. On the other hand, Mbappe has developed a reputation, whether fair or not, of putting himself first. Putting his ego first. Be it through negotiation tactics, subtle Instagram stories with subliminal messages, on-field pouts and visible frustration, or his influence on PSG's exodus of stars like Neymar and Messi, and even his insistence on image rights -- they have all painted a picture of a character that is looking out for himself.\n\nSome will argue that the off-field antics will not matter if the on-field performances excel. The current Real Madrid dressing room has proven otherwise. The best approach for Mbappe? Quickly fall in line with the team-first mentality cultivated by this unique group. After the Champions League final victory over Dortmund, Florentino Perez spoke about that mentality: \"The key to this team's success is that it's a family. No one tries to be more important than anyone else\". Ancelotti echoed his words and pointed to the team unity as a source of their success: \"This Madrid is a football family where everyone works and there is a very healthy atmosphere.\" In fact, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior are each pushing for the other to win the Ballon d'Or. The two amicably traded penalty kicks over the season. Fans, even those who support other clubs, often tout how likable this group of players is. If there was a way to measure club drama, it would read at a multi-decade low.\n\nFor Mbappe is to win over the hearts of all Madrid fans, it will take more than goals -- he will need to maintain the harmony and balance of the squad.\n\nThe longest, and most agonizing, transfer saga comes to an end. The official communication announcing 'Kylian Mbappe: a Real Madrid player' is just the start, there are multiple storylines and narratives to follow after his arrival. The next chapter will unfold with much of the intrigue on Mbappe's integration and attitude as much as his on-field performance. The other stars of the team: Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, and Rodrygo, have all publicly stated how eager they are to add the Frenchman to the squad. The best players want to play with the best players. Mbappe's ability to seamlessly integrate into this close-knit group and embrace the culture and standards set at the club will be pivotal. If he succeeds, he could not only achieve the personal glory he has long coveted but also help Real Madrid continue their unprecedented run of success.", "source": {"uri": "managingmadrid.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Managing Madrid"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentino_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florentino P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Camavinga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Camavinga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thibaut_Courtois", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thibaut Courtois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Benzema", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karim Benzema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rSl1ZZECSHqoaLB20QUtJU3fKAs=/0x0:4762x2381/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25475751/1450220326.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

That year, the striker -- who joined PSG from Monaco, initially on a loan agreement, in 2017 -- chose to renew at the Parc des Princes.\n\nMbappe's extension in 2022 included a 12-month extension clause for the 2024-25 season. However, only Mbappe could trigger that extension, not PSG.\n\nMbappe won 15 trophies across his spell in the France capital, including six Ligue 1 titles. However, Mbappe did not win the Champions League trophy at PSG -- losing to Bayern Munich in the club's only final appearance in 2019-20.\n\nMadrid's interest in the striker was revived this season, with The Athletic reporting in January that the Frenchman was aware of Madrid's contractual offer.\n\nAs reported by The Athletic, senior board figures informed Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti ahead of his side's Champions League last-16 first leg against RB Leipzig on February 13 that he could count on the striker from next season.\n\nMbappe informed PSG in February that he would not execute the optional additional year in his contract through to 2025 that had been included in his 2022 renewal; meaning he would leave the club at the end of the season as a free agent. Days later, the striker confirmed his decision to his PSG teammates and head coach Luis Enrique.\n\nMadrid will announce Mbappe's signing this week, ahead of this summer's European Championship. However, the date of the striker's presentation is less clear due to the player's international commitments.\n\nAnalysis from The Athletic's PSG correspondent Peter Rutzler\n\nKylian Mbappe is the best French player to have worn the PSG shirt. Arguably, he is their best of all time and perhaps their most important and influential.\n\nSince he signed for Monaco in the summer of 2017, initially on loan and then made permanent for an eye-watering \u20ac180million (now \u00a3153.8m; $193.7m), PSG have transformed as a club. They are now an internationally recognised brand, a super club, a team who have boasted star players and Mbappe has been at the heart of it.\n\nThe relationship between PSG's fans and their star player has not always been one of doting affection over the past seven years -- a product, as L'Equipe outlined last week, of his frequent 'near departures'. But he has been loved in Paris as a leader for club and country, the locally-born superstar who has become the face of PSG. Off-field matters have not fully diminished the respect, admiration, and indeed affection for this global superstar.\n\nToday, he is arguably the best player in the world and he has left his mark at PSG. He has broken multiple records since he signed, aged 18. He has surpassed all that have gone before him in Paris.\n\nHe has scored the most goals for PSG both domestically and in Europe, as well as the most hat-tricks, the most 'doubles' and the most goals in a single game (five). He has helped France win the World Cup during his time at the club, as well as scoring in successive World Cup finals, including one hat-trick, has won the tournament's Golden Boot, and has gone on to become France captain. He is the most prolific and consistent goalscorer the French league has seen since Jean-Pierre Papin was running riot for Marseille in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nHe received the Ligue 1 Golden Boot award six times in a row -- no player has done that before.\n\nWhile PSG were ahead of schedule with their Champions League run this season, Mbappe will still leave without winning the biggest prize in club football -- and that will always be a disappointment to him.

juggernaut?\n\nThere is no doubt most teams would give up their options in a heartbeat if they were offered Real's attacking riches, but how does Ancelotti fit all the stars into his side, while maintaining harmony among the squad?\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS Kylian Mbappe CONFIRMED as a Real Madrid player as Spanish giants finally get their man, with French captain signing on a free transfer from PSG after he agreed to a massive pay cut\n\nThe Italian preferred to utilise a split striker system this season, with Vinicius Jnr and Rodrygo on either side, and Bellingham slighter deeper as a false nine.\n\nThat was a combination that brought significant success as Bellingham added 23 goals and 13 assists, while Vinicius Jnr provided 35 goal contributions and has been tipped by many to win this year's Ballon d'Or.\n\nAlthough Rodrygo is touted as the one to be sacrificed for Mbappe, he still scored 17 times and made crucial contributions in crunch games against Man City and Barcelona.\n\nIt would seem unfair for Ancelotti to upset this balance, but he may be forced into a tough corner in order to make room for Mbappe.\n\nAs many teams have found in the past, such as England's Golden Generation in the early 2000s, fitting several stars into one system can be difficult.\n\nOne obvious solution could be to move Bellingham deeper, particularly with Toni Kroos' departure.\n\n17-year-old Brazilian wonderkid Endrick is also set to arrive at the Bernabeu this summer\n\nJude Bellingham, Vinicius Jnr and Rodrygo have developed a formidable partnership in attack\n\nCarlo Ancelotti will have to find a way to integrate Mbappe and not upset his side's balance\n\nBut that has the potential to impact the Englishman, with the 20-year-old having arguably been the best attacking midfielder in Europe this season.\n\nRead More Kylian Mbappe signs off his PSG career by winning the Coupe de France after 2-1 victory over Lyon... before striker admits his 'heart aches' as he prepares for his expected move to Real Madrid\n\nMeanwhile, although Mbappe brings with him a stunning record of 256 goals in 308 appearances over seven years in Paris, the French star still isn't the elite striker that Real have craved since Karim Benzema's departure last summer.\n\nAlthough Joselu has proven to be an admirable back-up option this year - and scored several crucial goals - the 34-year-old is firmly a squad option for Ancelotti and his future at the club isn't guaranteed.\n\nIn fact, Mbappe has often caused problems for both PSG and France due to his preference to feature off the left.\n\nFor Les Bleus, this has allowed Olivier Giroud to thrive, but The Athletic reported last season how he clashed with former PSG boss Christophe Galtier in regards to where he played.\n\nThis included a stinging post on his Instagram where he revealed he wanted to play on the wing and not as a 'pivot' in the middle.\n\nHe also repeatedly urged the club to sign a striker to avoid him having to fulfill that role, something they subsequently did with the additions of Goncalo Ramos and Randal Kolo Muani last summer.\n\nThis raises further questions given his preferred spot on the left is where Vinicius Jnr plays.\n\nMeanwhile, Brahim Diaz proved to be a valuable addition to the squad's attacking options upon his return from three seasons on loan at AC Milan.\n\nElsewhere, Guler, 19, dubbed the 'Turkish Messi', was already said to be frustrated at the lack of game time he received in his first season at the Bernabeu, a grievance that could increase when the Frenchman turns up.\n\nIt must be noted Mbappe did feature in a similar system to the one played by Real towards the back end of the campaign for PSG, with the Frenchman flanked by Bradley Barcola and Ousmane Dembele in a split-striker formation, something that will help him to adapt.\n\nDespite his quality, there are questions about how Mbappe's arrival at Real works in practice\n\nMbappe clashed with ex-PSG boss Christophe Galtier when he was played down the middle\n\nBut Ancelotti has shown time and time again that he has the skills to get the best out of stars\n\nYet, whatever happens, Ancelotti has proven time and time again that he is the perfect manager to get the best out of star names, with the Italian's man-management abilities unrivalled among colleagues.\n\nThere are also unlikely to be many other managers who have sympathy for Ancelotti given the plethora of attacking riches at his disposal.\n\nBut, while Madrid's options will be the envy of others, the Italian will have to find a way to fit Mbappe into his side and ensure Real continue their dominance of the European game over the coming years.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

He first began negotiations with Madrid in February after deciding to call time on his spell with PSG.\n\nThe Spanish side had been waiting for the Champions League final before announcing Mbappe's switch. Now he has officially arrived, with the Frenchman posting a series of photos from a tour he went on at the club as a child to show his longstanding association with them\n\n\"A dream come true, So happy and proud to join the club of my dream Real Madrid. Nobody can understand how excited I am right now. Can't wait to see you, Madridistas, and thanks for your unbelievable support. \u00a1Hala Madrid!\" Mbappe wrote in a statement posted in Spanish, English and French.\n\nMadrid announced his arrival with a customarily short statement, having spent years chasing the superstar. The club said: \"Real Madrid CF and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 have reached an agreement under which he will become a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons.\"\n\nMbappe officially confirmed his departure from Madrid in a video message posted on social media a month ago. In the message, the attacker emotionally looked back on his time with the French side, having spent seven years at the Parc des Princes.\n\n\"I wanted to speak to you. I've always said that I would speak with you when the time comes, and so I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain. I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks,\" he said.\n\n\"I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. It's a lot of emotion; many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club - one of the best in the world.\n\n\"Which allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure; to grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history - some of the greatest champions; to meet a lot of people, to grow as a man as well, with all the glory and the mistakes I've made.\n\n\"It's hard, and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that, to leave my country, France, Ligue 1, a championship I have always known, but I think I needed this - a new challenge after seven years.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Why Real Madrid signed France and former PSG superstar and his stats compared to Messi, Ronaldo", "body": "Kylian Mbappe officially signed for Real Madrid on June 3, 2024 after leaving Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer.\n\nIn May, the 25-year-old France international confirmed his decision to leave PSG, just days after they were knocked out of the Champions League semifinals by Borussia Dortmund.\n\nHe scored 256 goals in Paris and, after seven years in his home city, he won every trophy available to him except for Europe's top prize.\n\nReal Madrid lifted their 15th Champions League trophy at Wembley last weekend and the president of the club, Florentino Perez, said: \"I think that we are already focused on the next one. We want the 16th.\"\n\nThis free transfer is one of the most anticipated in football history and after years of chasing the PSG forward, Madrid have got their man.\n\nThe Sporting News takes a look at just how good Mbappe is and how he compares to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi at the same age.\n\nMORE: Vinicius out? Where Mbappe fits in Madrid's frontline\n\nMbappe is one of the best attackers in world football and has long been considered the heir to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the best male player on the planet.\n\nHe burst onto the grandest stage as he took the Champions League by storm as a 17-year-old for Monaco.\n\nThe Ligue 1 side's thrilling encounter against Pep Guardiola's Manchester City saw them overturn a 5-3 defeat after an electrifying first leg in England, where Mbappe scored on his first European start.\n\nMbappe and Monaco then took the game to City in the second leg as they won 3-1 at home, advancing on away goals after a 6-6 aggregate draw.\n\nAfter overcoming Dortmund, Monaco then reached the semifinals of the competition for the first time since 2004. But this was the furthest they would go as they lost 2-0 at home to Juventus in the first leg and were unable to overturn the deficit in Turin, losing 2-1 despite another goal from Mbappe.\n\nHe then made his move to PSG at age 18, where he signed on an eventual permanent transfer worth \u20ac180 million. This deal made him the second-most-expensive player, behind Neymar's \u20ac222m transfer to PSG from Barcelona, and the most expensive teenage player of all time.\n\nAt PSG, he broke all sorts of goalscoring records and won every domestic trophy as well as lifting a World Cup for his nation in 2018 in Russia. He led them to the final again four years later, scoring a hat-trick against Messi's Argentina before losing on penalties.\n\nHis game involves pace, exceptional dribbling ability and a fierce strike from his right foot. But he can also be clinical on his weaker side and beat his man on the inside or out.\n\nSounds like the perfect player, right? Maybe that's why Madrid have signed him. But what's missing from his game?\n\nBefore his death, Brazilian legend and arguably the greatest player of all time, Pele, gave high praise to France Football but also explained where Mbappe could improve. \"What is missing? Not much. Maybe his heading game, the impulse and the jump. That's what makes us different again because I had a lot of momentum. I was going very high and I scored a lot of headed goals.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Can anyone else even compete?", "body": "Ryan O'Hanlon is a staff writer for ESPN.com. He's also the author of \"Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.\"\n\nWe probably still shouldn't believe it until we see him attempting to juggle a commemorative soccer ball in front of the media and fans at the Santiago Bernabeu, but it seems like it finally happened. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has signed with Real Madrid, the club announced on Monday.\n\nThus ends nearly a half-decade of coy will-he-won't-he between Mbappe, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, a succession of Paris Saint-Germain managers, every French player on Real Madrid, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, and even the French prime minister, Emmanuel Macron.\n\nWhile it's normal to feel worn down by this saga -- as well as a resignation at the inevitability of Real Madrid signing the best soccer player in the world -- this is still quite rare. The best soccer player in the world rarely changes teams because whatever team is employing the best soccer player in the world (A) wants to keep said player, and (B) likely has enough money to continue employing said player.\n\nThe last time the best player in the world changed teams was maybe Lionel Messi, who moved from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2021, thanks to Barca's incredible financial incompetence. But Messi was already 34 years old at that point. The last time the best player in the world changed teams in his prime arguably was when Cristiano Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid in 2009, or more likely when the Brazilian Ronaldo changed from Inter Milan to Real Madrid in 2002.\n\nSensing a theme here? On the rare occasion a young, established, worldwide superstar switches teams, he tends to join Real Madrid. Let's break down the implications for the player, his new club, and his old club.\n\nAlthough he's taking a relatively substantial pay cut to leave Paris for Madrid, he might finally win the Ballon d'Or.\n\nI don't really ever see a time where PSG exists at the center of European soccer. They have such a massive financial advantage over the rest of the French league that it renders individual and team performance essentially meaningless amid the grander annual narrative of world soccer. Of course PSG wins Ligue 1 -- look at all their money! And of course PSG's attackers score and assist all of those goals -- look at all of their teammates!\n\nIn other words, the only way to have a truly meaningful season as a PSG player is to win a World Cup -- see: 2022 -- or to win the Champions League. If you play for Real Madrid or you play in the Premier League, though, your domestic achievements actually take on some weight.\n\nTo be clear, domestic league performance should matter -- the Champions League is a pretty random set of no more than 13 games, where nobody plays the same schedule. The club season has the same schedule for everybody, and there's no luck of the draw. The best teams and best players after 38 games are the best teams and best players.\n\nNow, for all of the farmer's league critics out there: We shouldn't have any doubt that Mbappe will light up LaLiga. One way that I like to look at player performance is to combine goals with expected assists. If you score a goal, you're getting on the end of the chance and you're converting it, but expected assists award you solely for the quality of your pass, without worrying over whether your teammate converted it.\n\nSince 2016, here are the Champions League leaders in non-penalty goals plus expected assists:\n\nThe fascinating thing is that Mbappe did most of that before what are theoretically going to be his prime years, between the ages of 24 and 28. He'll be only 25 at the beginning of next season.\n\nSo, is it as simple as that? The best player in the world is joining what's already the best team in the world? A side that's already filled with other stars currently in their mid-to-early-20s? A team that's only really missing a go-to goal scorer?\n\nThis shouldn't be complicated ... right?\n\nWhile I do think we tend to unnecessarily complicate this and every other sport -- the best players win games, and you win more games by acquiring better players -- there is a kind of diminishing returns here. Bear with me for second: If you could clone prime Lionel Messi, you'd win more games, but how many times would you want to clone him? Would a team of 11 Messis be better than a team of, say, three Messis, supported by other players who cover up the weaknesses and deficiencies of their trio of superstar clones? While I would pay money to see the former function, my instinct is that the latter would be the more effective team.\n\nSo, will Real Madrid be able to find the right balance with Mbappe in the team? Per FBref's similar-player algorithm, the most similar player to Mbappe is Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior; the second-most similar is Rodrygo. Or: the two players he'll be sharing a front line with at Real Madrid.\n\nThis isn't a bad thing, necessarily. Ian Graham, former head of research at Liverpool and one of the masterminds behind the signings of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Man\u00e9, has told me that the team purposefully targeted attacking players with diverse and overlapping skill sets. This made Liverpool's attacking movements more fluid and unpredictable -- all three players could execute any fundamental decision (dribble, pass, shoot) in any situation.\n\nIn Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, all three players are fantastic dribblers and shot-getters. None of them are world-class passers, but they've all shown the capacity to create quality shots for their teammates because of how good they all are at getting into dangerous areas. Amid the loose positional guidelines implemented by Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti -- he more or less trusts his attackers to figure it out -- this could and probably should be a devastating trio.\n\nFrom an attacking perspective, the concern would be that Mbappe and Vinicius tend to favor the same areas of the field.\n\nIn the past, Mbappe has expressed a preference for playing off of a target striker, but there aren't many target strikers at the top level of the sport these days -- and there certainly aren't any who are more effective players than Rodrygo and Vinicius. So, they'll have to figure it out.\n\nThe real question: how this will work without the ball? Although he's only 25, Mbappe has already stopped defending. This usually doesn't happen until an attacker's later years, but he almost never pressures the ball. Among all forwards who have played at least 900 minutes across Europe's Big Five leagues this season, Mbappe ranks 318th in combined tackles+interceptions per every 1,000 opponent touches. Rodrygo ranks 212th, and Vinicius sits at 185th.\n\nAnd it's not like being an effective attacker means you can't defend. The likes of Lamine Yamal, Bradley Barcola, Jamal Musiala, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku, Bukayo Saka, Diogo Jota, Gabriel Jesus, Goncalo Ramos, Raphinha, Cody Gakpo and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia all rank in the top 40 for adjusted tackles+interceptions.\n\nReal Madrid were able to survive the lack of resistance provided by their forward line this season because it was typically backed up by four midfielders. Jude Bellingham basically played as a No. 10 with license to break into the box at will, and while his defensive contribution is somewhat light for a traditional midfielder in a midfield three, it's quite strong for an attacking midfielder. Madrid were able to survive the second-highest opponent pass completion in LaLiga because they frequently had eight players behind the attackers who could defend.\n\nNow, you're swapping arguably the least active defender in the world for one of Real Madrid's midfielders. It won't be Bellingham, so it'll likely be for the retiring Toni Kroos, who was the least active of Madrid's midfielders. Perhaps Mbappe-for-Kroos doesn't make much of a difference. However, most of Madrid's defenders will be another year deeper into their 30s in a season where they'll likely have to do even more defending than they did this season.\n\nI'd bet on Madrid figuring it out -- Ancelotti found a way to play James Rodr\u00edguez with Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale -- but they're certainly pushing the limits of talent concentration.\n\nThis is a new era for PSG -- and not just in a \"post-Mbappe\" sense.\n\nEver since Qatar Sports Investments took over PSG in 2011, they've pretty much always had at least one superstar in the roster. In 2012, they added Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Beckham. The likes of Thiago Silva, Edinson Cavani, David Luiz and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda weren't superstars (though they were globally recognized greats), while the likes of Marquinhos and Marco Verratti developed into that same level of player after joining the club at a young age.\n\nIn 2016-17, there was a brief pause, when Ibrahimovic went to the Los Angeles Galaxy. Cavani, Di Maria, Thiago Silva, Marquinhos and Verratti were all established world-class players, but the team lacked a true headline star. That season, they lost their first league title since QSI took over, and they were embarrassed by Barcelona in the Champions League, coughing up a 4-0 first-leg lead after losing in Spain, 6-1.\n\nHow to ensure that never happens again? Well, they went out and acquired the mastermind of Barcelona's 6-1 comeback, Neymar, and also signed Mbappe, the best player on the Monaco team that beat them to the Ligue 1 title.\n\nThe Neymar move seemed to herald in a new era in European soccer. Superstars in their primes never left Barcelona. But when PSG paid the player's full buyout fee -- \u20ac222 million, more than double the previous world-record fee -- they had no choice. If PSG could do this and scoop up Mbappe, the best teenager the sport had seen since Neymar, what would stop them from doing this to every other team's best player?\n\nA couple years later, legendary Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon joined the club and then, as Barcelona's finances spiraled out of control during the pandemic, PSG were the only club who could afford the salary of the best player in the world. The same summer that Lionel Messi joined, so too did perhaps the most famous defender in the world, Sergio Ramos, and goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who was coming off of a Euro-winning star turn for Italy.\n\nFast forward to today, and Marquinhos and Donnarumma are the only players of those mentioned that still with the team. According to the crowd-sourced player valuations at the site Transfermarkt, PSG do not employ any of the 50 most valuable players in the world. This is a team that had a payroll of about $395 million (per estimates from the site FBref) just last season, which was nearly $80 million more than any other club in the world.\n\nSo what now? The biggest club in France and the richest club in the world just lost arguably the greatest French player of all time, a Paris-born 25-year-old, to the old money of Real Madrid. It turns out PSG haven't flipped European soccer on its head -- they just threw it off balance for a couple years.\n\nQSI's stated goal for the club is to win the Champions League, and they've still only reached one final since 2011 and just two other semis. While they're coming off of another semifinal appearance this season, much of that comes down to a cushy draw that saw the four favorites -- Manchester City, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich -- drawn together on the opposite side of the bracket.\n\nAs far as it's worth measuring PSG's domestic league performance, this was actually one of their worst seasons yet. The best future-looking metric is a blend of expected goals (70%) and actual goals (30%). We'll call it \"adjusted goal rating,\" and here's how all of the QSI seasons stack up against each other:\n\nNot totally coincidentally, that standout season of 2019-20 was the same one that they made it to the Champions League final.\n\nIf this past year was a down year and then the team just lost arguably the best soccer player in the world, what might come next? After Messi and Neymar left the club, it at least seemed like PSG had begun to build a team around Mbappe. They'd begun signing younger, unspectacular players who compliment him and fill in the gaps behind him. The talent distribution really doesn't matter at all for winning Ligue 1, but these star-laden teams frequently fell apart in the Champions League when they came up against the constant pressure provided by the other top clubs in the world, who all had stars of their own but also had cohesive tactical systems.\n\nStars beat systems, but a system with stars is going to beat stars without a system. PSG have almost actively downgraded their overall talent level in order for manager Luis Enrique to implement a possession-heavy, we-almost-literally-never-cross-the-ball approach. But the system still had Mbappe at the top of it, scoring 35 goals across Ligue 1 and the Champions League.\n\nI certainly buy the argument that it's easier to build a system without Mbappe -- there are lots of other young, prolific attackers whose presence won't make it impossible for you to press aggressively, but that's more of a question for Real Madrid, who already have perhaps the most talented squad in world soccer. PSG, though, seemed to be building a team that worked for Mbappe, who accounted for more than double the expected goals and assists of anyone else on the team in the Champions League. And now he's gone.\n\nAnd it's not clear who might be best to replace him. There isn't a young, readymade superstar out there who PSG could easily acquire. There are ready-made superstars who it would be really hard to acquire -- say, Erling Haaland or even Bukayo Saka -- or not-quite-superstars like Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Inter Milan's Lautaro Mart\u00ednez who won't be clear needle-movers.\n\nWere I PSG, or any other big club, I'd look at Napoli's 23-year-old winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who doesn't have the star power, but seems undervalued because of Napoli's struggles after winning the title last season. The Georgian was just as good, if not better, as last season, and he's only just entering his peak years.\n\nWhatever direction they go, though, the era of PSG signing aging-and-or-wantaway superstars seems like it's over -- both because they want it to be and because the players just aren't out there. In terms of building a coherent team, that's probably for the best. Whatever comes next, then, will require long-term planning and patience, two ideas that no one has ever associated with PSG.", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The goals were scored by Dani Carvajal in the 74th minute and Vinicius Junior in the 83rd minute. Real Madrid displayed dominance with 58% possession and 13 shots, 6 of which were on target. Their precise passing with 91% accuracy and disciplined play with only 1 yellow card illustrated their commanding performance, securing their place in the illustrious history of the Champions League. According to several reports, Kylian Mbappe will join Real Madrid and the he will be officially announced by the club within this week. From winning the 15th UCL to signing one of the best players in the world, the week has been a win-win for the Spanish club.\n\nAlso Read:Madrid plot 16th CL triumph; Mbappe would further bolster the squad\n\nJose Mourinho made a huge statement on the effect of Kylian Mbappe on Jude Bellingham\n\nJude Bellingham's goal total may drop next season, according to Jose Mourinho, since Kylian Mbappe is joining Real Madrid. He expects that Bellingham's location farther from the goal will affect his chances of scoring. Following Real Madrid's 2-0 Champions League final victory over Borussia Dortmund, Mourinho said in a TNT Sports interview that Carlo Ancelotti is probably going to favour an offensive three of Mbappe, Vinicius Jr., and Rodrygo. As such, Bellingham would be moved to play in the midfield with Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga, and Aurelien Tchouamen. (via Metro) He added:\n\n\"Bellingham will score less goals next season. Because the system is going to change, the position of Bellingham is going to change. They will play Rodrygo, Mbappe and Vinicius Jr, they will play three. For me, he [Carlo Ancelotti] will play with two midfield players and Bellingham behind the three attacking players. So in midfield he will play probably [Federico] Valverde, [Eduardo] Camavinga and [Aurelien] Tchouameni, and Luka [Modric] coming when the game needs eyes. But with these guys, Rodrygo, Mbappe and Vinicius, to play against them... it's hard.\"\n\nWith Real Madrid, Jude Bellingham had an amazing rookie season that ended with him winning the UEFA Champions League on Saturday. Throughout 42 games for Los Blancos, he scored 23 goals and provided 13 assists.\n\nBellingham was questioned about Kylian Mbappe maybe joining Real Madrid following their Champions League victory at Borussia Dortmund. Excited, the midfielder said it would be amazing to work with the French superstar. Then he added:\n\n\"It would be amazing [for] a player like him [to join us]. You see tonight... the only little thing we were missing was that clinical nine. And if he is to come and give us that, we would be in a really great place and he would take us to another level.\"", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aryan_suraj_chadha@republicworld.com", "name": "Aryan Suraj Chadha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Camavinga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Camavinga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Valverde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Valverde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/photo-2024-06-03t094638.277-171738825971716_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The striker is set to represent France at the Euros in Germany this summer, after which he will join Madrid for their pre-season tour.\n\nIt's likely that Mbappe will play through the middle for Real Madrid, with Vinicius Jr set to retain his place out wide. But considering Carlo Ancelotti's tactical flexibility and the freedom his players have on the pitch, it's more likely that we could see a rotational system in attack.", "source": {"uri": "technosports.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechnoSports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Maldini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paolo Maldini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Lahm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philipp Lahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Ramos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Ramos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentino_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florentino P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://technosports.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Kylian-Mbappe-Image-Credits-Twitter-1-683x1024.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Well, apart from the obvious fact that Mbappe has already etched his name amongst a pantheon of football greats at his young age with even more upside to be tapped into, they have been on the hunt for a proper classic number 9 and a goal-scorer since the departure of their Ballon d'Or winner, Karim Benzema who made his way to Saudi Arabia.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasser_Al-Khelaifi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasser Al-Khelaifi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Benzema", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karim Benzema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Le Parisien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Associations", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/kylian-mbappe-ap-1-2024-05-608e6450654253942c659deba39cf5dc-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

It ends years of speculation an drama around the Frenchman.\n\nMbappe will join the 15-time Champions League winners on a free transfer from PSG after failing to agree another new contract with the Ligue 1 giants. It also puts to bed any outside opportunity for Premier League clubs to sign the 25-year-old.\n\nArsenal had been linked with the World Cup golden boot winner after Mikel Arteta opened up how the club should deal with his availability. Speaking in January he said, \"\"Why not?\" when asked if the Gunners should be in for signing Mbappe.\"If we want to be the best team, we are going to need the best talent and the best players, that is for sure.\"\n\nAs for Chelsea, they had Mbappe on trial as a teenager but failed to get a deal over the line. He instead opted to move to Monaco, where he built up his standing as superstar in the making.\n\nMbappe then made the big-money switch to PSG via a loan. He went on to become the club's all-time top scorer before eventually being snapped up by Madrid following two years of public flirting with the idea as well as broken promises.\n\nHe will leave PSG with more goals than any other player though after a staggering 256 in 308 games for the club. He also managed 108 assists, though wasn't able to deliver the holy grail in Europe.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal news and transfers: LIVE!\n\nREAD MORE: Man United set to complete second Arsenal raid as Mikel Arteta prepared to lose key figure\n\nMbappe has already played two World Cup finals, winning one, as well as lifting the French domestic league title seven times.

For Arsenal it is a case of what-if after Arsene Wenger admitting making serious moves to get him to north London.\n\n\"You know at one point I tried to convince him to come to Arsenal,\" he said in a BBC documentary about the global icon. \"I was at his home with his parents. He was a happy boy. He just wanted to play football and had the passion for the game.\"\n\nFormer scout Giles Grimandi said similar. \"We met his parents in London who came to the training ground and alongside Arsene and Richard Law [then transfer chief] we travelled to meet Kylian in the South of France.\n\n\"We tried, and I really don't think we were far from getting him, but he declined the project and signed a new deal with Monaco. I'd say it is probably the biggest disappointment in my 15 years as an Arsenal scout, not convincing Kylian Mbappe to sign for the club.\"", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_coley@football.london", "name": "Tom Coley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichichi_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pichichi Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars\u00e8ne_Wenger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29287919.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KYLIAN-MBAPPE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

No European club is close to matching that feat, with AC Milan the next most decorated team in the competition with seven honours, closely followed by Liverpool and Bayern Munich on six.\n\nRodrygo, described as 'special' by Ancelotti, has been at Real Madrid since 2019 following a move from Brazilian outfit Santos. Throughout his five years in Spain so far, he has scored 54 goals and registered 41 assists in over 200 appearances across all competitions.\n\nRodrygo responds to exit rumours Liverpool and Man City have been linked\n\nThe 23-year-old's future has been at the centre of speculation in recent months due to the highly anticipated arrivals of Kylian Mbappe, as well as Rodrygo's compatriot and 17-year-old wonderkid, Endrick.\n\nLiverpool have been linked with Rodrygo for quite some time, while Spanish outlet MARCA recently tipped Manchester City as a potential destination for the player, should he depart the Bernabeu. However, it seems it is the Brazilian's desire to move absolutely nowhere as he basks in yet more success with Real Madrid.\n\nJournalist Fabrizio Romano recently reported Rodrygo intends to stay put in Spain and honour the contract extension he signed only last November. On Saturday, in the aftermath of the team's victory in London, he addressed the rumours once more.\n\nRodrygo told reporters:\n\n\"This week some media said about bids, clubs, interest... I don't know anything about it and I'm not interested. Even if there are proposals, I have no idea about that... I'm staying. I'm happy here. How can I leave Real Madrid?\"\n\nMbappe to complete Real Madrid move Rodrygo might struggle for game time amid Liverpool and City links\n\nIn what has been Europe's worst kept secret, Kylian Mbappe has, according to reports, finally completed his move from Paris Saint-Germain to Real Madrid. The France international has long been primed for a move to the Bernabeu and it is now, at long last, about to happen.\n\nMbappe is out of contract at PSG this summer and will complete a free transfer to Real Madrid. Romano reported on Sunday that the deal has now been signed and completed, with the La Liga giants set to unveil the superstar as early as next week.\n\nRomano claims that the player's decision was made as early as February, when it became clear he would not be extending his stay in Paris. There had been tentative links to Premier League clubs, including Liverpool and Man City, but Real Madrid was always the expected destination for Mbappe.\n\nRelated Jude Bellingham Gives Emotional Interview After Real Madrid Win Champions League Jude Bellingham struggled to hide his emotions after becoming a European champion with Real Madrid for the first time in his young career.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

There is a famous picture of Ronaldo with his arm around the youngster, who only comes up to his hero's shoulder.\n\nOn Monday, he posted on X that the move was \"a dream come true\", yet it has taken more than a decade for Mbappe to make it back to Madrid to play for the 15-time European champions.\n\nMadrid tried again to sign Mbappe in the summer of 2017, but Paris Saint-Germain lured him away from Monaco.\n\nReal made a further attempt to buy him in 2021 and to sign him in 2022, before he agreed to extend his stay at PSG. Now, however, Real have their man.\n\nHe leaves PSG at the age of 25, after seven prolific years in which he became his hometown club's all-time top scorer but never managed to win the Champions League.\n\nIt has been a slow goodbye to Paris, but things have usually moved fast for Mbappe in his career, almost as fast as the player himself in full flight.\n\nThere are few more thrilling sights in modern football than Mbappe racing at an opposition defence. His pace is astonishing. He is a voracious goal-scorer and is still a player who can dominate the sport for years to come.\n\nEven though PSG had already started the process of building for a future without Mbappe, his departure is a monumental blow for the club.\n\n- Bondy boy -\n\nIt is significant move too for Mbappe, the boy brought up in Bondy, the commune in the deprived Seine-Saint-Denis department which makes up the inner north-eastern suburbs of Paris.\n\nBondy is immensely proud of Kylian, whose father Wilfried coached him at the local club and whose mother, Fayza, was a handball player.\n\nAfter Mbappe signed for PSG a mural appeared on the side of an apartment block overlooking the canal that runs from central Paris up through Bondy. It was accompanied by the slogan: \"Bondy, Ville des Possibles\" -- the town where anything is possible.\n\nMbappe's upbringing was unlike most in Bondy. He went to a private school, for example. But he is an icon there, and throughout France.\n\nYet he always wanted to go to Madrid one day, just as they were desperate to sign him.\n\n\"Real wanted Kylian but we wouldn't really have had our bearings there had we gone,\" recalled Mbappe's father, who helped his son, and many other budding players, develop as a youth coach in Bondy.\n\nInstead, the youngster joined Monaco in 2013, Wilfried moving down to the Mediterranean with him.\n\n- Ballon d'Or one day? -\n\nHis arrival in the principality did not go unnoticed, with Le Parisien dedicating an article \"to one of the great hopes of his generation\", who was photographed holding a Monaco shirt with the number seven on the back.\n\nMbappe, it said, had already signed a deal with Nike. He revealed his plan to the newspaper, \"to one day win the Ballon d'Or\".\n\nHe was still 16 when he made his first-team debut for Monaco in December 2015, beating Thierry Henry's record to become the principality side's youngest ever player.\n\nSoon he became their youngest ever goal-scorer, and in the following 2016/17 season he starred in a Monaco team that reached the Champions League semi-finals and netted 15 times as they won the Ligue 1 title.\n\nA sensational 180 million-euro transfer to PSG followed at the age of 18.\n\nThe next year he won the World Cup, becoming the first teenager since Pele in 1958 to score in the final, as France beat Croatia 4-2 in Moscow.\n\nThere was also his stunning hat-trick in the 2022 World Cup final, which France lost on penalties to Lionel Messi's Argentina.\n\nHe has just finished as Ligue 1's leading scorer for a sixth straight season. He has won the French title seven times, but now he will hope a move to Madrid can finally see him win the Champions League and the Ballon d'Or.\n\nBefore that he will be aiming to lead his country to glory at the European Championship in Germany.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There is only one way to find out: by loading up Football Manager 2024 and running a bunch of experiments in the interest of producing serious, accurate and reliable journalism.\n\nWe simulated Mbappe's entire career at Real Madrid, which lasted 11 seasons, in FM24 to see how things might play out. Here are the results.\n\nA domestic double looks nice on paper and ticks a bunch of boxes, but considering the strength of Real Madrid's new-look side, there is an unwritten expectation that this team should be winning the treble more seasons than not.\n\nReal Madrid won the league by 17 points, but they did not blow away their opposition in Europe, losing to RB Leipzig in the round of 16 in the Champions League.\n\nIt was a fun start to a new Galactico era. Mbappe played up front, rather than on the left, and he won trophies, but an early exit in Europe had doubters lining up by the droves to criticise his decision to leave Paris.\n\nFor Mbappe, it is heartbreaking. For the neutral, it is probably the outcome they wanted most in the interest of keeping a healthy competitive balance. With a domestic double once again secured, this time round, Real made the Champions League final and came up against their biggest rivals, Barcelona -- and lost 2-0.\n\nThey also lost the Club World Cup final to Manchester City, so they could not even call themselves \"world champions\". Once again, they were close, but no cigar.\n\nVinicius Junior and Rodrygo both scored more league goals than Mbappe, whose total of 25 across all competitions was one less than the aforementioned duo.\n\nReal's transfer outlay was modest, with only \u00a320million spent on Kalidou Koulibaly (\u00a315million), Renato Sanches (\u00a32.5million) and Angelino (\u00a32.5million). Given the depth of their squad, oddly enough, not many people were quick to offer sympathy towards their lack of spending.\n\nWith Carlo Ancelotti still in charge, the expectations placed upon the Italian manager were rising in Spain's capital. Mbappe alternated between playing up front and also as a left-winger, but his team regressed.\n\nFor the past two years, they won the league, Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup. In season three, they \"only\" won La Liga, albeit by 13 points. It is fair to wonder if they could have achieved the same results without Mbappe.\n\nSome of their transfer moves were questionable, too. Real spent \u00a345million on Arnaut Danjuma, but he only made one start in the league all season. Leon Goretzka, who at this point is 31 years old, started plenty of games but did not post an average rating above 7/10, which is considered the benchmark for a good performance in FM24.\n\nThree seasons in, Real Madrid are undoubtedly a domestic force, winning three La Liga titles in a row for the first time since Barcelona achieved the feat between 2008 and 2011. But in Europe, it was an Erling Haaland-led Manchester City side who reigned supreme, with Pep Guardiola's side making it two Champions League wins in three seasons.\n\nAnother year, another easy title victory. Real have clearly proven to be the best team in Spain so far during this experiment. They finished 14 points ahead of Barcelona in second place, which follows on from previous point differentials of 17, 13 and 13 respectively.\n\nGiven they have established themselves as the dominant force in Spain, we will give them some leeway for yet another campaign with no Champions League triumph. Would they care for my leeway in real life? I am guessing not, but I am going to excuse their continental failures regardless.\n\nMbappe had another decent season. He once again outperformed his xG by around 10 goals and provided a modest return of 15 league goals.\n\nTheir only notable additions to their starting line-up are Borussia Dortmund full-back Julian Ryerson and Chelsea's Benoit Badiashile. For what it is worth, Ancelotti is still the manager. Is he the reason they have not yet won another European trophy since signing Mbappe? Only time will tell.\n\nThe wheels are starting to fall off. For the first time in five seasons, Real Madrid did not win a single trophy.\n\nAnother mediocre display in the Champions League, coupled with Barcelona finally ending their domestic dominance, left the club in a tricky position.\n\nMbappe did, however, reach a personal milestone. He finished joint-top scorer in La Liga alongside former Coventry striker Viktor Gyokeres, but that is a small consolation in an otherwise disappointing season.\n\nThe club's transfer strategy left a lot to be desired, too. The headline additions were Crystal Palace's Tyrick Mitchell and Joe Gomez, who at this point played for PSG but moved to Spain's capital and did not feature much.\n\nSix seasons into this experiment and still no Champions League victory in sight. Real exited the tournament at the quarter-final stage against Bayern Munich. They won the Club World Cup, which put a band-aid over an increasingly large and gaping continental-sized wound.\n\nIf Mbappe went six seasons without any success in Europe, people would have plenty of questions. They did win the league again, so it was not all bad.\n\nMbappe chipped in with 30 goal contributions in all competitions, but his team's inability to get over the final hurdle in Europe meant a lot of those goals he scored in the early rounds of the Copa del Rey were far less significant.\n\nContinuing with their theme of signing random Premier League players, Real signed Ibrahima Konate for \u00a358million alongside two regenerated players, bringing their total outlay for the season to \u00a3119million. Mbappe is now 30, entering the final year of his deal and Ancelotti has retired. The clock is ticking.\n\nThe stage was set for one of the most Hollywood-style endings to a season in recent memory. Jurgen Klopp took charge of Real Madrid and their final fixture of the season was the Champions League final. Their opponents? Liverpool.\n\nIf they won, it would complete a historic treble, having already won the league and Copa del Rey. So what did they do? They lost 3-1.\n\nA return of 19 goals in all competitions seems a little low, but Mbappe did miss a chunk of time with injury, including the Champions League. Outside of that, Real's domestic dominance continued, so it was not all bad.\n\nThey spent \u00a3191million on new players, with \u00a395million of that going on French goalkeeper Guillaume Restes, with the other \u00a396million spent on made-up, regenerated players. Mbappe extended his deal by an extra year, but there was a lot of uncertainty heading into year eight.\n\nNot to be deterred by a painful defeat against Liverpool, Real once again made it to the Champions League and faced Manchester City, who were managed by Unai Emery at this point in the experiment. They won the league by 20 points, which was their seventh title in the last eight seasons and also won the Copa del Rey.\n\nThe treble was right there for the taking -- and they took it, beating City 2-1, with Mbappe missing a penalty that ultimately did not prove too costly.\n\nIt took them eight years but they finally did it. Mbappe did not exactly cover himself in glory during Real's European exploits -- he only scored twice and missed a penalty in the final. In La Liga, he was the second-highest scorer. He alternated between playing on the left and up front and produced solid numbers: 27 goals and 16 assists for the season.\n\nHe has not yet won the Ballon d'Or but did extend his contract by another year, so there is still time.\n\nIt was worth the wait. After going seven seasons without a Champions League title, Real now had two in two years, but Mbappe, who was now in the \"father time\" period of his career at 33 years old, did not play a large role in winning the double.\n\nHe missed three months of the season with injury and also was not fit for the final against Manchester City. He once again extended his contract, but his importance was declining, with regenerated player Daniel Kuche now the star of the team.\n\nYet Real's central midfield trio of Bellingham, Camavinga and Tchouameni aged like a fine wine. That base in the centre of the park is the bedrock of this trophy-laden run, with Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo and Mbappe doing their bit, too.\n\nFor anyone wondering how Endrick, one of the best wonderkids in FM23, was getting on, the Brazilian had only scored 32 league goals in eight seasons in Madrid.\n\nThere was to be no three-peat as Real were knocked out of the Champions League by Manchester City in the semi-finals in Mbappe's 10th season at the club. They won the league once again, as well as the Club World Cup and Copa del Rey.\n\nMbappe had interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia but ultimately chose to extend his deal by another year -- therefore extending my time monitoring this simulation. I was hoping he would accept that big payday from Al Ittihad, but instead, I had to make my sixth iced coffee of the day and soldier on.\n\nVinicius Jr won the Ballon d'Or for the second year in a row and 34-year-old Trent Alexander-Arnold has just signed for Real on a free transfer.\n\nDespite having another year left on his contract, Mbappe decided to hang up his boots in July 2034.\n\nReal Madrid coasted to yet another league title but Mbappe played a very small part in that. He only started nine games in the league and was largely an afterthought as Real won La Liga.\n\nHis final year in Madrid was understandably quiet, given he was now 35 years old and way past his prime.\n\nMbappe was an important piece in the jigsaw, but history will remember Vinicius Jr as the unquestioned leader of Real Madrid's dominant run across these 11 seasons.\n\nThe Brazilian won the Ballon d'Or twice and Bellingham won it once. Mbappe managed a third-placed finish in 2031, but if two of your team-mates were crowned as the world's best player, it is hard to argue that you were the driving force of that dynasty.\n\nBut he was still important. Mbappe, who was used as a centre-forward more often than he was a left-winger, played a significant role in helping Real Madrid to render the competitiveness of La Liga to that of Ligue 1, where one team (PSG) reigns supreme every year.\n\nIn total, Mbappe won 25 trophies in Madrid and won 10 out of 11 league titles on offer. They won the league by an average margin of 13.6 points during that time, too.\n\nA return of only two Champions League titles could be improved upon, with both of those victories happening after Mbappe had turned 30, but his team's domestic performance was so strong that even his fiercest critics may overlook that. His individual numbers were impressive, too.\n\nMbappe was never the league's top scorer, but a return of 34 goal contributions per season on average is a healthy return and undoubtedly helped Real Madrid become historically dominant in La Liga but less so in Europe.\n\nManchester City, led by Erling Haaland, managed four Champions League victories and eight Premier League titles during this experiment. They were the most dominant team in the entire world.\n\nReal Madrid spent years trying to sign Mbappe. They finally got him and he ended his career in this painstaking 11-season FM24 simulation with two Champions League titles but no Ballon d'Or win. Was it worth it? Casual football fans may say no, but the brand responsible for producing those eight tubs of instant coffee I got through would say otherwise.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

He achieved this milestone with a remarkable performance, netting a brace against PSG's fierce rivals Marseille and then securing his place in history with a last-minute clincher in a thrilling 4-2 victory over Nantes on March 4, 2023.\n\nMbappe's trophy cabinet at PSG is equally impressive. He won six Ligue 1 titles, four Coupes de France, and two Coupes de la Ligue. Additionally, he played a pivotal role in PSG's journey to the 2020 Champions League final, showcasing his talent on one of football's biggest stages. However, that UEFA Champions League is the only coveted trophy that has alluded him in his young yet spectacular career.\n\nOn the international stage, Mbappe has been a key player for France, scoring 46 goals in 77 appearances. He ranks third among France's all-time top scorers, trailing only Thierry Henry and Olivier Giroud.

It would allow silky winger Rodrygo to join the attack on the right of a wider front three.\n\nAncelotti has helped Vinicius to develop from a promising but highly inconsistent winger into an elite forward who can break down any defence.\n\nThe Brazilian flexed his muscles by scoring a hat-trick against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final in January, and netted in the Champions League final win over Dortmund.\n\nVinicius would also likely benefit with Mbappe beside him as opposition defences would no longer view him as the one key threat to be shackled by any means necessary.\n\n- Renewal -\n\nMbappe's arrival will also lay the next stone in a period of renewal for the club as a whole.\n\nPresident Florentino Perez lavished nearly 900 million euros ($970 million) on renovations to the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, which will finally finish in the summer.\n\nMadrid are also still pushing for a breakaway European Super League project but unlike ailing Barcelona, their partners-in-crime, they have the team to actually compete in one.\n\nThe club's veteran players are being phased out as new, hungry and extremely talented youngsters fill up the squad.\n\nWhile Barcelona have not found convincing replacements for departed greats Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets, among others, Madrid have most of their homework done in advance.\n\nThe players who will take Luka Modric and the retiring Toni Kroos' places are already at the club.\n\nMadrid have Eduardo Camavinga, Federico Valverde and Aurelien Tchouameni in midfield, all 25 years old or under.\n\nHaving so many leading talents harks back to Madrid's Galactico era in the 2000s, except these stars have their best years ahead of them.\n\nBy contrast Luis Figo arrived at 27, David Beckham at 28 and Zinedine Zidane at 29.\n\nRodrygo, Brahim Diaz and Arda Guler are further youthful options up front for Ancelotti, with Madrid's squad the best in Spain.\n\nOne of the few doubts around Mbappe's arrival is about potential ego battles in the dressing room, and there is no better coach than the avuncular Italian to manage star names, as demonstrated during his two stints at the club.\n\nAnother is that both Vinicius and Mbappe prefer starting off the left, although this season the Brazilian has found his footing down the middle.\n\nIf he and Mbappe click as Madrid hope, their fluid movement and connection will make light of any positional concerns -- and any defence that crosses their path.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [],

It would allow silky winger Rodrygo to join the attack on the right of a wider front three.\n\nAncelotti has helped Vinicius to develop from a promising but highly inconsistent winger into an elite forward who can break down any defence.\n\nThe Brazilian flexed his muscles by scoring a hat-trick against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final in January, and netted in the Champions League final win over Dortmund.\n\nVinicius would also likely benefit with Mbappe beside him as opposition defences would no longer view him as the one key threat to be shackled by any means necessary.\n\n- Renewal -\n\nMbappe's arrival will also lay the next stone in a period of renewal for the club as a whole.\n\nPresident Florentino Perez lavished nearly 900 million euros ($970 million) on renovations to the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, which will finally finish in the summer.\n\nMadrid are also still pushing for a breakaway European Super League project but unlike ailing Barcelona, their partners-in-crime, they have the team to actually compete in one.\n\nThe club's veteran players are being phased out as new, hungry and extremely talented youngsters fill up the squad.\n\nWhile Barcelona have not found convincing replacements for departed greats Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets, among others, Madrid have most of their homework done in advance.\n\nHaving so many leading talents harks back to Madrid's Galactico era in the 2000s, except these stars have their best years ahead of them.\n\nBy contrast Luis Figo arrived at 27, David Beckham at 28 and Zinedine Zidane at 29.\n\nRodrygo, Brahim Diaz and Arda Guler are further youthful options up front for Ancelotti, with Madrid's squad the best in Spain.\n\nOne of the few doubts around Mbappe's arrival is about potential ego battles in the dressing room, and there is no better coach than the avuncular Italian to manage star names, as demonstrated during his two stints at the club.\n\nAnother is that both Vinicius and Mbappe prefer starting off the left, although this season the Brazilian has found his footing down the middle.\n\nIf he and Mbappe click as Madrid hope, their fluid movement and connection will make light of any positional concerns -- and any defence that crosses their path.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [],

Kylian Mbappe has confirmed he will leave the French capital club this summer and it is an open secret that he now will sign for Real Madrid on a free transfer after his contract expires.\n\nMbappe has been a long-term target for Madrid. But throughout the endless speculation about where the France World Cup winner's next destination would be, Liverpool have always been mentioned. The player, arguably the greatest of his generation, has gone on record himself to express his admiration for the Reds and their legendary outgoing manager.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool benefit from controversial TV decision as new figure proves dominance\n\nREAD MORE: Richard Hughes key to Liverpool triggering release clause and securing early summer transfer\n\nBut while the Premier League is the clear financial frontrunner in Europe when it comes to TV rights, transfer fees and wages, even the richest clubs among the English top flight, like Arsenal and Liverpool, had a job on their hands when it came to making the numbers add up for Mbappe, as Klopp conceded last year. While moving to Madrid for nothing in terms of a transfer fee, 'nothing' doesn't quite cover the extraordinary contract it would require to actually secure the 25-year-old's signature.\n\nDave Powell, the chief business of football writer for Reach Plc, explores the figures behind Mbappe's PSG contract, and why he was always going to be out of treach...\n\nCould Liverpool afford Kylian Mbappe?\n\nDave Powell: \"There isn't a major football club on the planet that won't have looked into the feasibility of signing Mbappe. Liverpool certainly did at one stage before quickly realising it was cost prohibitive. Numbers relating to Mbappe's salary have been doing the rounds for a long time, and weekly salaries ranging from \u00a31m-\u00a32m have been reported. The former is more likely to be the case, and a sum of around \u00a3650,000 is understood to be the truer figure.\n\n\"It has been through the sheer scale of his signing-on fee when he agreed to extend his deal with Paris Saint-Germain to 2025, a reported figure of \u00a3156m, that has been the real driver of potential wealth from the PSG deal, as well as loyalty bonuses that exist, and increase, with every year Mbappe remains a PSG player.\n\n\"The issue is that the PSG project is changing - it has had to - and the focus on reducing costs by bringing through more talent, like Warren Zaire-Emery, is paramount. That, allied with the diminution of media rights in France making the market as a competitive force even smaller, means that reaching his prime at 25, Mbappe feels he has done as much for French football domestically as he can. He has outgrown it. The Premier League is the biggest league in the world, and it isn't close. Its popularity is soaring overseas, and with markets like the US now ready to pay a premium for broadcast rights, its power will remain for some time.\n\n\"In theory, you would think if there is one place that Mbappe could land, aside from taking a deal from a Saudi Pro League side, it would be England. But while every 'big six' club would see the value from a competitive and marketing standpoint, the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) in the Premier League, and the fact that the clubs that would push the boat out are sailing close to those figures, make it a non-starter. Chelsea's willingness to spend \u00a31bn in the market has been widely covered, and that transfer spend has seen their amortisation costs jump significantly. So, too, has their wage bill, and to bring in a player of the calibre of Mbappe would be fanciful in the extreme.\n\n\"Arsenal, too, have been sailing close to the PSR limit, although that will be eased considerably when back-to-back Champions League seasons are accounted for. For Manchester United, they have also had to be mindful of PSR, but despite the struggle for success on the pitch, the club jumped back to fifth in the Deloitte Money League, with revenues of \u00a3648.5m. That is, however, some \u00a374.5m behind the world's biggest revenue-generating club, and the club where Mbappe is destined to land this summer, Real Madrid.\n\n\"English clubs usually operate a tighter wage structure. Offering players extraordinary amounts might seem wise in the short-term to land talent, but when it comes to renegotiations of contracts with existing players, they will likely try and get as close to parity as possible, and that can open the door to an enormously costly wage bill that can spiral out of control pretty quickly. English clubs know the limits of PSR, which is allowable losses of \u00a3105m over three years, with allowable deductions for investment into infrastructure, community, women's teams, and the academy, but there are enough grey areas to make it that clubs have to push the brakes if they can't trade players effectively to push up spending limits.\n\n\"In Spain it is different. LaLiga's economic controls are implemented by a group of analysts who review the finances of every club before establishing a squad cost limit. With this number, clubs go into the new transfer window knowing the total amount they can spend on first-team players and coaching staff. Those funds can be then be divided between transfer fees or wages in accordance with the club's preferences, as LaLiga does not impose a wage cap. Real Madrid, who have been building up to an Mbappe deal for a long time, have spent smarter with it in mind. They have held back on some major deals they may have pursued in order to land the player they have coveted for some time. They know exactly what they can spend, they know exactly how to make the numbers work.\n\n\"Clubs in the Premier League won't be engaging with a deal such as this with little planning and with the spectre of PSR or a potential move to UEFA's squad cost ratio to come. Deals like this aren't reactionary, and it's likely there won't be any Premier League club that has even tried their luck to convince Mbappe of a destination other than Spain for some time.\n\n\"How the deal is structured is another matter. A popular move in the US is a portion of wages being deferred and paid in significant tranches, as has been the recent case with the mammoth $700m (\u00a3557m) deal for Shohei Ohtani to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. That sum is to be paid in $2m-per-year sums for 10 years before deferred compensation arrives for another decade after that. North American sport is different, however, as there is more guarantee over long-term income, although there are few more guarantees in European football than Real Madrid being in the Champions League, with the club even still pushing for the creation of a European Super League.\n\n\"The numbers just don't add up for Liverpool and other Premier League clubs for Mbappe. No club has reigned in spending to try and land him, no team has played the long game like Real has. The die has been cast, and the enormous demands of Mbappe mean that he realistically has had only one option from the start, even if a transfer fee isn't involved.\"\n\nA version of this article was

prosper with Mbappe?\n\nThere are obvious concerns that Mbappe's signing will knock Rodrygo down the pecking order at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nThat could be the case if Ancelotti continues to implement a front two, but a change of formation could create the space to start Rodrygo, Mbappe and Vinicius.\n\nWhile he may not be on Mbappe's or Vinicius' level, Rodrygo remains a key player for Real Madrid as Ancelotti was keen to point out ahead of the Champions League final.\n\nThe forward made 51 competitive appearances throughout the 2023-24 campaign, scoring 17 goals and providing nine assists.\n\nAs a result of those contributions, he has now registered 54 goals and 41 assists in 216 matches following his arrival from Santos in the summer of 2019.\n\nID:545019:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect4220:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A Champions League trophy delivered without a recognised, world-class No 9 in the team.\n\nAll the talk before, during and after Saturday's win over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley surrounded how Carlo Ancelotti has masterminded another Real success having lost Karim Benzema last summer to Saudi Arabia. Now the talk is about how another French forward can take them to another level.\n\nKylian Mbappe is set to arrive at Real Madrid having snubbed the Spanish giants three times. Once after a trial with Real's U12 team, then twice to favour PSG in 2017 and 2022. Now he will arrive at the Bernabeu when his new side need him most.\n\n\"The only thing we're missing is that clinical nine,\" said Bellingham after Saturday's Champions League final.\n\n\"If he was to come and give us that, we would be in a really great place to go and take us to another level. One of the best players in the world!\"\n\nReal will now have their world-class No 9 - arguably one of the best out there. The problem is, what happens to players like Vinicius and Bellingham following their heroics not just at Wembley, but all through the season?\n\nAncelotti reacted to the loss of Benzema by not directly replacing him, instead adopting a 4-3-1-2 formation, using Vinicius and Rodrygo as 'split forwards' who adopt wide areas - allowing new signing Bellingham to venture in a free role behind them at the tip of a midfield diamond.\n\nIt is a front three that will not be broken up in terms of transfer sales. Vinicius and Bellingham - with 24 and 23 goals respectively this season - were the two most important players for Real this season. Rodrygo, despite rumours linking him with a move, has vowed to stay in the Spanish capital next season.\n\nBut Mbappe is now set to be the jewel in Real's shining crown, following his 256 goals in 308 games in the French capital. Yet how does PSG's old No 7 become Real Madrid's main man, and not take anything away from current Real No 7 Vinicius, who is arguably one of the best players in the world?\n\nAn issue could arise given Mbappe and Vinicius both played in the same position this season - and the Brazilian is not going to budge.\n\n\"Vinicius has really made the left-hand side his. That is his best position,\" Spanish football journalist Semra Hunter told Sky Sports News.\n\n\"Let's work under the premise that Ancelotti is going to stick with a 4-4-2 next season, with Jude Bellingham at the top of the midfield diamond.\n\n\"That means Vinicius and Mbappe can start in a two-pronged attack, like what Vinicius and Rodrygo have been doing this season.\"\n\nReplacing Rodrygo will not be an easy decision for Ancelotti, given the Brazilian forward's key role in Real's recent Champions League successes.\n\nThe Italian manager would be omitting the player who scored in both legs of this season's quarter-final victory over Manchester City, one that all but made the Champions League Real's to lose. And will Mbappe even accept Rodrygo's current role as 'right forward' to accommodate Vinicius?\n\nThere is the argument that Rodrygo barely plays on the right wing, despite being the 'right forward'. Two seasons ago, Ancelotti said the 23-year-old has \"so much potential as a centre forward or a second striker\", implying his role in Real's 4-3-1-2 is as central as it looks - making it perfect for Mbappe, who always preferred the No 9 role to a wide one at PSG.\n\nOr could all four - Mbappe, Vinicius, Rodrygo and Bellingham - play together in an ultra-attacking Ancelotti plan? He adopted a 4-3-3 formation at Real Madrid for years before Benzema's departure, so it would not be an alien move.\n\n\"Rodrygo is more tactically flexible - he can play on the right, left or as a No 10,\" added Hunter.\n\n\"He could play 4-3-3, with Mbappe in the middle and Vinicius and Rodrygo on the wings. But that means he would have to sacrifice a midfielder and they are so stacked in that area. I don't see that happening too often.\"\n\nMbappe is not the only new arrival at Real this summer, with Brazilian starlet Endrick also putting another dazzling option among the ranks. Given the 17-year-old's heroics to date for club and country, do not be surprised if he has something to say in this debate.\n\nBut the teenager will develop in his own time while the world watches Mbappe. He is the man Real Madrid are bringing in to dominate Europe.\n\nAnd if they are winning Champions League titles without him, what are the Spanish giants going to achieve with him?", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Benzema", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karim Benzema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Champion_Clubs'_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Champion Clubs' Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Freight_Forwarding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Freight Forwarding", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/22/05/1600x900/skysports-mbappe-psg-real-madrid_5777758.png?20220520124411", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-03", "dateEnd": "-01-02", "textStart": 1299, "textEnd": 1306, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Over the weekend, following Madrid's triumph in the UEFA Champions League Final over Borussia Dortmund, 2-0, Mbappe completed his blockbuster move. This epitomized the old adage of the rich getting richer, as the Los Blancos, winners of six of the past 11 CL trophies, have managed to add one of, if not the best attacking forward in football.\n\nAs is the case with nearly every bombshell move in sports, there are some who are not big fans. Some fans compared Mbappe's decision to join Real Madrid, the best club in European football this past season, to that of Kevin Durant's choice to spurn the Oklahoma City Thunder in free agency in 2016 to sign with the Golden State Warriors to form a superteam that made them an unbeatable unit, and arguably the best team ever assembled in NBA history.\n\nHowever, some fans contended that Kylian Mbappe's decision to join Real Madrid doesn't even come close to the impact Durant's choice to join the Warriors had on the sport's competitive picture.\n\n\"Not really a comparison, cause in football the best players always go to the best teams,\" Reddit user sergechewbacca wrote. Added user Pentinium, \"Lol, Mbappe is not even close go kd move.\"\n\nOne of the main differentiators is that Kevin Durant joined the team that eliminated him from championship contention. Meanwhile, it wasn't as if Kylian Mbappe's Paris Saint-Germain fell to Real Madrid in the Champions League. In fact, it was Madrid's opponent in the Champions League Final, Borussia Dortmund, that knocked off PSG.\n\n\"Mbappe's team, PSG, did not lose to Real Madrid this season. Also, he had been in the [discussion] of joining Real Madrid for a couple of years, and the [decision] had been already made before Real Madrid even [reached] the finals. So, KD way worse,\" Reddit user bandwagonguy83 explained.\n\nKevin Durant's Warriors move is way worse than Kylian Mbappe's Real Madrid decision, says fans\n\nBeyond the reasons mentioned above, the nature of football, or soccer, as a sport is that the impact of one player is far less than how much an individual can affect the game of basketball. In basketball, one player can do the heavy lifting by commandeering the majority of possessions. Meanwhile, in football, teams need every player to be a threat on the pitch -- a threat to pass, shoot, or make forward runs as well as defend.\n\nIn football, a player cannot simply dribble around the opposition. (Unless you're Lionel Messi.) There must be good synergy from all the 11 players on the pitch. Thus, adding Kylian Mbappe, while making Real Madrid an even more dangerous club, doesn't guarantee them the La Liga title or a successful defense of their Champions League trophy.\n\n\"There are 11 players on the field in football for a team There are only 5 in basketball. You tell me which sport can an individual be more impactful in,\" Reddit user idontknow_whatever wrote.\n\nMoreover, Kylian Mbappe has some experience when it comes to playing in stacked teams. It wasn't as if Paris Saint-Germain were slouches during his time with the club. In fact, at one point, PSG had Lionel Messi and Neymar play alongside Mbappe. Alas, despite dominating Ligue 1, PSG exited the Champions League in the Round of 16 during Messi's stint.\n\n\"At one point of time, psg team was Messi, Neymar and mbappe. Won s**t with it,\" user likpoper wrote.\n\nStill, it's important to note that Real Madrid will be an even scarier club to face next season. Their front line is as stacked as it can get, with Kylian Mbappe lining up alongside Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo, with Jude Bellingham just right behind them waiting to make things happen. But this move is not as destructive to the parity of football as Kevin Durant's move to the Warriors was to the NBA.\n\nKD to the Dubs guaranteed championships\n\nIt's not like Kevin Durant simply made the decision to join the team that knocked them out of championship contention in 2016. He also joined a Warriors team that won 73 games the season prior, and he replaced Harrison Barnes, the forward who struggled mightily with his shot as the Dubs choked away a 3-1 series lead in the NBA Finals.\n\nDurant is an all-time great shooter in his own right, and adding him alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson made for some ridiculously good but unfair basketball. He elevated an all-time great team and made them an unstoppable force. For two seasons, there was a sense of inevitability that the Warriors will be the team standing tall come season's end, and they might have won three championships in a row had Durant stayed healthy during the 2019 NBA playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kylian-Mbappe-Kevin-Durant-comparison-shot-down-by-fans-after-blockbuster-move.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Without Mbappe, Madrid again proved to be the best team on the continent - and have won the Champions League six times in the past 11 years - and now they are going to add the world's most devastating forward. An announcement will be made this week.\n\nWhile it is the culmination of a pursuit that has effectively gone on for 12 years - ever since Mbappe was first invited to Madrid, with Zinedine Zidane acting as his chauffeur and Cristiano Ronaldo happy to be photographed - there was always an inevitability that he would one day pull on the fabled white shirt.\n\nThere may have been a few false starts and surprising U-turns but Mbappe is the world's most prized free transfer. His signing will prove to be far more important than Paris St-Germain acquiring Lionel Messi, given the captain of France is still just 25 and absolutely coming into his prime.\n\nThe lure of Madrid would always win just as it did for Jude Bellingham. His parents, Mark and Denise who guide his career, were smart enough to talk to all suitors - chiefly Manchester City - but, actually, always knew their son was destined to join Los Merengues.\n\nIt is not just Mbappe who is arriving this summer with Brazilian prodigy Endrick able to make the move after the Copa America and his 18th birthday in July. Madrid agreed a \u20ac60 million deal to sign him from Palmeiras 18 months ago and Endrick has already made his mark on the European stage, having scored the winning goal in Brazil's friendly victory over England last March.\n\nThe signing owed much to the extraordinarily assiduous work of Juni Calafat, Madrid's head scout whose influence extends way beyond that relatively modest title. The Brazilian has implemented the bold and successful policy of pursuing some of the world's most precocious talents and not least from his homeland.\n\nAnd so the rest of football will face a new dynasty; a new kindergarten version of the 'galacticos' and while Mbappe will immediately become the jewel in that line-up he will have to not only work hard to outshine the others but, at 25, is already one of the older players.\n\nThere is Bellingham at 20, Endrick at (soon-to-be) 18, Arda Guler 19, Eduardo Camavinga 21, Vinicius and Rodrygo both 23, Aurelien Tchouameni and Brahim Diaz both 24, and Fede Valverde at 25. These are players with their best years ahead of them but already - bar Endrick - Champions League winners.\n\nIn fact, more than half of Madrid's transfer spend over the last six years has been committed to players 21 or younger. That is around \u20ac415 million. But then Mbappe's market value would be \u20ac300 million alone as would Bellingham's. And that is without considering Vinicius.\n\nIt is a much more astute transfer policy than during Florentino Perez's first term as president, from 2000 to 2006, when he signed the likes of Zidane, Luis Figo and David Beckham and felt he needed to do so to stay in office. Perez is now 77 and not under that pressure. Neither are Madrid making the same misstep of overspending on someone like Eden Hazard. Now they wait, they sign young and they use their allure - hence why David Alaba and Antonio Rudiger were so eager to join on relatively cut-price deals.\n\nIt is also through expediency, of course, with Madrid's finances remaining under severe scrutiny, but no-one can argue that they have not - with their policy - added huge value to their squad and thrown down a challenge to their competitors. The appeal of the Madrid shirt is undoubted and with their latest signings they have not only brought more players with incredible potential and futures but strengthened what is already the most formidable club side in world football.\n\nWhat will be intriguing is how they fit in. The perceived wisdom is that Mbappe will have to play as a No 9 - a role he balked at with PSG and does not like for France either, preferring to come in from the left. But Vinicius should be retained there with Rodrygo on the right (for now).\n\nIt would mean Bellingham dropping into a midfield three alongside Valverde and either Tchouameni or Camavinga and it will be fascinating to see if it works. The worry for Madrid's rivals is that if any coach can do it then Carlo Ancelotti can and the Italian - called the \"final boss\" by Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzic before the Wembley final - extended his contract at the Bernabeu last December until 2026 having been interested in the Brazil national team job until there was a change of president.\n\nBut whatever happens, whatever permutation Ancelotti comes up with, Madrid will already be favourites to retain the Champions League when the final is played in Munich on May 31 2025. The rest of Europe knows that.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_burt@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Jason Burt", "type":

That doesn't fit, that's not us. It is not us.\n\n\"That's how it is. Honestly, I have no problem with that.\n\n\"People can judge me for the finals I have lost, no problem at all, and there are some out there that do that.\n\n\"Or they judge me for the finals we won, that's fine as well. I couldn't care less, to be honest.\n\n\"We won what we won and we tried as hard as we could. But we did it the Liverpool way, that's how I see it.\n\n\"That means this city, where the city came from over the last decades, where the club came from maybe since the 90s where we didn't win anything anymore for a while, it's so impressive what we did together.\n\n\"And I mean together with our owners as well, because I know them, they're good people.\n\n\"It's not that they are not bothered about what we think, 'you always ask for money' and stuff like that.\"\n\nThere will be some fans who remain disappointed with a perceived lack of ambition from FSG when it comes to the transfer market.\n\nBut Mbappe's move sums up the situation for a club like Liverpool, fighting among the elite without the oil-funded, state-backed wealth that many of their closest rivals boast.\n\n\"We have owners who feel responsible for the club,\" Klopp continued.\n\n\"Are they the best in the world? I don't know the others, I cannot say that. But they work really hard as well so that we were successful.\n\n\"I felt supported. If other people say 'if he could have got supported more, he could have won more'.

The Brazilian appeared to give both clubs a clear answer after the Champions League final.\n\nHis second European honor since joining the Bernabeu, having played a major role in both of those triumphs, it's initially hard to see why Rodrygo would be getting linked away at all. But the anticipated arrival of Kylian Mbappe will prompt some major competition for spots, with Wembley goal-scorer Vinicius Jr a pretty unmovable fixture on the wing.\n\nTo that end, in April, Liverpool supposedly 'contacted' Real Madrid about the player's availability. And right before the final, it was being claimed that Rodrygo himself was 'aware' of the interest, and in fact he made comments that appeared to leave the possibility of a move away from Real Madrid open.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool data wizards may have found cheaper Florian Wirtz but PSG and Spurs are there too\n\nREAD MORE: Aurelien Tchouameni offers gift to Liverpool fan after Champions League final\n\nAs for Manchester City, links have ratcheted up in intensity over the last couple of weeks. Marca claimed the winger was 'in the sights' of Pep Guardiola's team.\n\nYet in the afterglow of the final, per Give Me Sport, Rodrygo sent a clear message to his suitors. He appears determined to stay, even if it means battling with Mbappe for a spot.\n\n\"This week some media said about bids, clubs, interest... I don't know anything about it and I'm not interested,\" Rodrygo told reporters. \"Even if there are proposals, I have no idea about that... I'm staying. I'm happy here. How can I leave Real Madrid?\"\n\nThe BBC reported earlier today that Mbappe has now officially signed his Real Madrid contract, which means he will join as a free agent once his PSG deal expires on June 30. The move has been verbally agreed since February, with the groundwork stretching back years.\n\nLiverpool.com says: We've seen big trophy wins influence transfer decisions in the past. Would Steven Gerrard have stayed in 2005 without Istanbul?\n\nIn any case, even if Rodrygo had been on the move, Liverpool rarely signs players directly from European giants. Manchester City might have been a more likely destination, so on balance it's probably no bad thing that he intends to stay.\n\nThen again, with the Mbappe situation, it's worth Liverpool keeping a watchful eye on how things pan out. Rodrygo might not be able to contemplate leaving Real Madrid now, on the back of Champions League triumph, but he is too good not to be starting the majority of matches.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_martin@liverpool.com", "name": "James Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marca_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marca (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Gerrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Istanbul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Istanbul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article29281344.ece/alternates/s1200/0_rodrygo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 1826, "textEnd": 1833}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

But I think, I needed this, a new challenge after seven years.\"\n\nLatest on SportstarSri Lanka vs South Africa Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: SA wins by 6 wicketsTeam SportstarSL vs SA, T20 World Cup 2024: South Africa decimates Sri Lanka in Group D opener Team SportstarKylian Mbappe completes move to Real Madrid on a free transfer till 2029Team SportstarF1: Esteban Ocon to leave Alpine at end of 2024 seasonTeam SportstarStrange bedfellows USA and cricket come together with T20 World Cup 2024 on fresh shoresAshwin AchalREAD MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousmane_Demb\u00e9l\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Pierre-Mauroy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Pierre-Mauroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Monaco_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AS Monaco FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Ocon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ristn/article68246418.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/AFP__20240530__34UD9JU__v2__HighRes__FblEuro2024FraTraining.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The France captain has been heavily linked with Real for some time but there have always been rumors about a potential move to Liverpool.\n\nMbappe has shot to superstardom in Paris but his career could have panned out very differently. He actually met with Liverpool back in 2017 when he was a teenager at Monaco to discuss a possible switch.\n\nThere were further talks two years ago and Mbappe revealed all to the Daily Telegraph, saying: \"I talked to Liverpool because it's the favorite club of my mum, my mum loves Liverpool. I don't know why, you will have to ask her. It's a good club and we met them five years ago. When I was in Monaco I met them. It's a big club.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool urged to make shock $51m Everton transfer for ace Jurgen Klopp raved about\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool transfer target 'wants to leave' as Jamie Carragher tips Champions League bid\n\nJurgen Klopp was eager to sound caution after links re-emerged to Liverpool last year, when it became apparent he would be leaving PSG. Mbappe is set to sign a five-year deal worth $16m (\u00a313m/\u20ac15m) at the Bernabeu and those finances made a deal almost impossible for the Reds.\n\nKlopp told Sky Germany: \"I can say that I think he's a really good player but the financial conditions don't suit us at all. I wouldn't like to ruin the story now... but as far as I know, there's nothing to it.\n\n\"It's possible that someone else from the club is preparing something and wants to surprise me... that hasn't happened in the eight years that I've been here. That would be the first time.\"\n\nLiverpool's FSG owners have justifiably been reluctant to spend record sums of money over the years and in his farewell event with supporters last week, Klopp again referenced the French superstar.\n\n\"If Liverpool would be the club with endless money, you can spend what you want,\" the 56-year-old said. \"Kylian Mbappe comes here, Bellingham comes here, Haaland comes here. It doesn't fit, it's not us. It is not us. That's how it is.\"\n\nLiverpool.com says: Liverpool moving for Mbappe was always going to be unlikely once he made the move to PSG, although it says a lot for the regard in which the Reds were held that he continued to be linked with a move to Anfield. The inevitable if finally happening this summer though as he heads to Real Madrid, which will be a scary thought for the rest of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_prenderville@liverpool.com", "name": "Liam Prenderville", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Packing_and_Shipping_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Packing and Shipping Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpool.com/article29282978.ece/alternates/s1200/0_gettyimages-1035790334jpgs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618706", "eventUri": "eng-9618706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The striker has already spoken about his new step and his dream is now to win the Euros with his country. It is his priority right now and he does not want to be distracted from this goal. The dream of playing in the Olympic Games is complicated by the fact that he is not in Thierry Henry's first list.\n\nFor the presentation at the Santiago Bernabeu, the most likely option is to look for a date after Euro 2024 and it could be July 15 or 16, but it is not the only option and it is not even ruled out that it will be on the return from vacation.

Eugenie le Sommer has a record 93 for the women's team.\n\nMbappe scored an unforgettable hat-trick in the 2022 World Cup final, finishing as the tournament Golden Boot winner with eight goals even as his then PSG club-mate Lionel Messi inspired Argentina to the title on penalties.\n\nHe is also one of only six players to score four or more goals in a game for France, against Kazakhstan in November 2021.\n\nHe has scored 12 goals in World Cups and six in qualifiers, another dozen in European Championship qualifiers, seven in the Nations League and nine in friendlies.\n\nHe goes to Euro 2024 looking for his first goals in the finals of the competition, having drawn a blank in four appearances in 2021 and missed the decisive penalty in a shoot-out defeat to Switzerland.\n\nVinicius Jr was Real Madrid's top scorer in the season just concluded, netting in the Champions League final to edge out Jude Bellingham 24 goals to 23.\n\nThat is the lowest tally for Real's leading marksman since before the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009, with the Portuguese averaging 50 goals a season in all competitions in his nine years with the club including 61 in 2014-15 and 60 in 2011-12.\n\nKarim Benzema then took over the mantle, with at least 30 goals in four of the next five seasons - peaking with 44 in 2021-22 when he scored 15 in the Champions League alone.\n\nHis fellow Frenchman Mbappe will arrive with expectations to lead the line in the same way as those players once did.\n\nStill only 25 and having scored 42, 39, 41 and then 44 club goals in all competitions over the last four seasons, there will be hopes he can emulate Ronaldo's half-centuries.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

that could start dynasty", "body": "Real Madrid are the deserved champions of Europe, but they could get even better next season.\n\nLos Blancos announced the sensational signing of Kylian Mbappe on Monday as he departs Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nThe forward, a World Cup winner with France and seven-time Ligue 1 champion, is regarded as one of the best players in world football even though he's never won the Champions League.\n\nHe joins the reigning champions' squad that boasts some of the best talent in Europe, including Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr.\n\nWith Madrid's new blockbuster signing made official soon, talkSPORT.com has looked at how they could line up next season.\n\nThibaut Courtois, a three-time LaLiga winner, is likely to return as the starting goalkeeper having missed most of the 2023/24 campaign through an ACL injury.\n\nHe started in the Champions League final over Andriy Lunin and Kepa Arrizabalaga, with the latter set to return to Chelsea this summer at the end of his loan spell.\n\nAt centre-back, both Eder Militao and David Alaba also suffered ACL injuries this season, with the former returning in March and the latter not playing since December.\n\nMilitao, who has won ten trophies in five years at Madrid, could therefore claim a starting spot alongside Antonio Rudiger, the former Chelsea man who kept 22 clean sheets this season.\n\nFerland Mendy has regularly been named as their left-back since he joined from Lyon in 2019, contributing to much of their domestic and European success.\n\nHaving scored the opener in their Champions League final win over Borussia Dortmund, the long-serving Dani Carvajal is set to remain at right-back.\n\nThe Spaniard has been at Madrid since 2013 and has made 416 appearances for the club, winning four LaLiga titles and six European crowns amongst other honours.\n\nAlthough Toni Kroos recently announced his retirement Madrid still have plenty of midfield options, with Federico Valverde missing just one game this season.\n\nHe could be poised to play alongside the talented 21-year-old Frenchman Eduardo Camavinga, with club legend and veteran Luka Modric and Aurelien Tchouameni also worthy options.\n\nAttacking midfielder Bellingham is highly likely to play in front of them off the back of an incredible debut season.\n\nThe England star scored 23 goals and assisted a further 13 across all competitions in their treble-winning campaign, in which he made 42 appearances.\n\nOn the left of Madrid's front three could be Vinicius Jr, who scored their second goal in the Champions League final.\n\nIt took his tally to 24 for the season and like Bellingham, the Brazilian has been touted as a contender for this year's illustrious Ballon d'Or award.\n\nThe versatile Rodrygo has proven an effective teammate alongside his countryman in the attack and he looks set to shift into his popular position out on the right wing.\n\nAnd leading the line for Madrid is set to be Mbappe, with the 25-year-old arriving as their latest 'Galactico' signing.\n\nHaving scored 256 goals in 308 appearances for PSG, the Frenchman is one of the most clinical finishers in world football and could be an ideal role model for 17-year-old Endrick, who also arrives this summer.\n\nMbappe will surely take the team to the next level and feature in a side that could dominate Europe for the years to come.\n\nSpeaking to talkSPORT, European football expert Andy Brassell echoed this sentiment: \"It does just give us that feeling that maybe this is the point where Real Madrid start to build a dynasty in Europe.\n\n\"They've got a team that was kind of in semi-transition this season, where Bellingham has had a much better season than anyone could have reasonably expected.\n\n\"A lot of their other players have done likewise but in this, in inverted commas 'transition season', they've won LaLiga by losing one game all season, they've won the Champions League

Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has signed with Real Madrid, the club announced on Monday.\n\nThus ends nearly a half-decade of coy will-he-won't-he between Mbappe, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, a succession of Paris Saint-Germain managers, every French player on Real Madrid, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, and even the French prime minister, Emmanuel Macron.\n\nWhile it's normal to feel worn down by this saga -- as well as a resignation at the inevitability of Real Madrid signing the best soccer player in the world -- this is still quite rare. The best soccer player in the world rarely changes teams because whatever team is employing the best soccer player in the world (A) wants to keep said player, and (B) likely has enough money to continue employing said player.\n\nThe last time the best player in the world changed teams was maybe Lionel Messi, who moved from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2021, thanks to Barca's incredible financial incompetence. But Messi was already 34 years old at that point. The last time the best player in the world changed teams in his prime arguably was when Cristiano Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid in 2009, or more likely when the Brazilian Ronaldo changed from Inter Milan to Real Madrid in 2002.\n\nSensing a theme here?

Eugenie le Sommer has a record 93 for the women's team.\n\nMbappe scored an unforgettable hat-trick in the 2022 World Cup final, finishing as the tournament Golden Boot winner with eight goals even as his then PSG club-mate Lionel Messi inspired Argentina to the title on penalties.\n\nHe has scored 12 goals in World Cups and six in qualifiers, another dozen in European Championship qualifiers, seven in the Nations League and nine in friendlies.\n\nHe goes to Euro 2024 looking for his first goals in the finals of the competition, having drawn a blank in four appearances in 2021 and missed the decisive penalty in a shoot-out defeat to Switzerland.\n\nThat is the lowest tally for Real's leading marksman since before the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009, with the Portuguese averaging 50 goals a season in all competitions in his nine years with the club including 61 in 2014-15 and 60 in 2011-12.\n\nKarim Benzema then took over the mantle, with at least 30 goals in four of the next five seasons - peaking with 44 in 2021-22 when he scored 15 in the Champions League alone.\n\nHis fellow Frenchman Mbappe will arrive with expectations to lead the line in the same way as those players once did.\n\nStill only 25 and having scored 42, 39, 41 and then 44 club goals in all competitions over the last four seasons, there will be hopes he can emulate Ronaldo's half-centuries.",

with 256 goals.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner surprised PSG last year when he sent a letter stating he would not take up the option of a one-year extension when his contract expires in June.\n\nThe letter led to a standoff with the club and Mbappe was omitted from the first-team squad before being reinstated.\n\nAllowing Mbappe to run down the final year of his contract meant PSG were unable to recoup any of the 180 million euro ($196m) transfer fee they paid in 2017 to sign him from AS Monaco.\n\nWhen the transfer was completed, Mbappe became the second-most expensive player of all time after his former PSG team-mate Neymar.\n\nReal Madrid had courted Mbappe in the past but failed to land the player, who signed a contract extension with PSG in May 2022 when the Spanish club had a bid rejected.\n\nWith Mbappe finally in their ranks, the club can look at consolidating their dominance in LaLiga, where they lost only once last season to win the title by 10 points and they were

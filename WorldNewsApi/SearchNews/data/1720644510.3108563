He's logged 1,000-yard campaigns in seven out of nine seasons and has had at least five touchdowns every year. However, the 2015 No. 4 overall pick turns 30 in a couple of weeks and isn't quite as good as the receivers who made the cut. So, while he might get a new contract next spring, it likely won't be as lucrative as his younger and better counterparts. Current contract (via Over The Cap): 5 years, $100 million Keenan Allen Like Cooper, Allen runs sharp routes and has been productive with over 900 catches, 10,500 yards and nearly 60 touchdowns during his career. However, also similar to Cooper, the former Charger and current Bear is getting up there in age after turning 32 last April. Additionally, he's suffered a few injuries recently which will impact negotiations in the spring. Current contract (via OTC): 4 years, $80.1 million DeAndre Hopkins Hopkins is another older wideout who has an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with about 12,400 yards and 78 touchdowns in his career. However, he's had a drop-off in production since putting up over 1,400 yards in 2020. Granted, part of that is due to a suspension two years ago, but the 32-year-old isn't the same player he once was. Current contract (via OTC): 2 years, $26 million Diontae Johnson While Johnson is the only player to miss the cut and be under 30 years old, he's not exactly a spring chicken as he'll turn 28 next month. Also, the former Steeler and current Panther only has one 1,000-yard season to his name and just isn't of the same caliber as the top five wideouts. So, Johnson will get a raise in the spring, just not close to a record-setting one. Current contract (via OTC): 2 years, $36.71 million Brandin Cooks Playing for five different teams in 10 seasons, Cooks has struggled to stick in one spot during his career. He's been productive with over 9,000 career yards and 57 touchdowns, but he's consistently floated in the good, not great category. Barring a surprise, the 30-year-old will likely add another organization to his long list seeing as the Cowboys will presumptively prioritize Ceedee Lamb in free agency. If Cooks wants to finally have a permanent home, he will probably have to take a discount stay in Dallas.

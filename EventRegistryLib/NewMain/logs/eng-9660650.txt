Thanks to a favorable schedule of late, the Fever have become one of the hottest teams in the WNBA.\n\nIndiana extended its undefeated streak to three games following an 88-81 win over the visiting Washington Mystics on Wednesday night at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. Also, for the first time since 2015, Indiana has won four consecutive home games.\n\n\"I was a freshman, I think,\" Fever star Aliyah Boston said about the last time Indiana had such a streak, per Zion Brown of the Indianapolis Star.\n\n\"Yeah, I was in eighth grade,\" Clark added.\n\nThe Fever are becoming more confident about themselves. Against the Mystics, Clark was able to show why she was taken first overall by Indiana at the 2024 WNBA Draft. The Iowa women's basketball product shot 6/12 from the field and hit all of her four attempts from the foul line to finish with 18 points.\n\nClark also had 12 rebounds and passed for six assists while collecting four steals during the 37 minutes she spent on the floor. Meanwhile, Boston and Kelsey Mitchell each produced 22 points.\n\nThe Fever have been one of the best shooting teams of late, as they have posted a 50.3 percent shooting from the field in their last three games.\n\nBefore the Mystics game, the Fever took down the Atlanta Dream, 91-84, to start their homestand on June 14. Then they beat Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky on June 16, 91-83. Indiana's current win streak as a home team started when the Fever victimized the Sky in a thrilling 71-70 win on June 1.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark Breaks Silence on \"Lazy\" Indiana Fever Team Habit With Seven Words", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rex_villas@postandcourier.com", "name": "Rex Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/46/34670d4f-307a-5a22-b7e0-93a63c81b319/66741fb43890d.image.jpg?crop=959%2C503%2C0%2C148&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1454, "textEnd": 1461}, {"amb": false, "date": "1991-06-16", "textStart": 1513, "textEnd": 1524}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1643, "textEnd": 1649}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 85, "textEnd": 92}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

After winning just once through their first nine games of the 2024 WNBA season, the Fever have gone 4-2. They are also on a winning streak for the first time this season, having won both of their last two outings.\n\nFever head coach Christie Sides recently offered insight about what's been propelling Indiana amid an ongoing midseason turnaround by her team.\n\n\"They're learning each other, and that's what this is,\" Sides said after the Fever scored a 91-83 win over the Chicago Sky at home last Sunday (h/t Zion Brown of the Indianapolis Star). \"This is what's happening right now -- they're learning each other. They're learning how to play off each other, they're recognizing reads off each other.\"\n\nIn the win over Chicago, Clark paced the Fever with 23 points on 7/11 shooting from the floor, but she did not have to carry the team by herself, as four other Indiana players each scored at least 15 points. Moreover, the 23 assists Indiana had in that game was the most by the team so far this season.\n\nThe Fever have to continue showing that they're more than just about individual productions and that Indiana is better than the sum of its parts.\n\nWith a 5-10 record, the Fever still have a long way to go to hit .500 again, but they are at least trending in the right direction. Up next for Clark and the Fever is a date with the lowly Washington Mystics at home this coming Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Fever Coach Christie Sides Takes Firm Stance on Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese Rivalry Before WNBA Rematch", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rex_villas@postandcourier.com", "name": "Rex Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois\u2013Indiana_men's_basketball_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois\u2013Indiana men's basketball rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Educational", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/f4/7f45a1d2-2381-5a2a-afef-417682d61e08/6671666dc8293.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-06-", "textStart": 76, "textEnd": 83}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Who should we bet on tonight?\n\nAaliyah Edwards: With Shakira Austin (hip) still out, rookie Aaliyah Edwards is in line for a major role going forward. She's averaging 9.1 points and 6.4 rebounds per game on the season, but since the start of June, she's started six games and is averaging 12.7 points and 9.3 boards per game while shooting 63.0 percent from the field.\n\nIndiana Fever\n\nCaitlin Clark: Caitlin Clark has put together two big games in her last four contests, and she torched Washington for 30 points on 8-of-15 shooting (7-for-13 from 3) in their first meeting this season. Clark is still only shooting 38.3 percent from the field, but she's coming into her own through 15 WNBA games. She is a great player to target in the prop market tonight.\n\nMystics vs. Fever Prediction and Pick\n\nI'm actually pretty bullish on the Fever this season for a few reasons.\n\nIndiana has struggled against the top teams in the league - going a combined 0-9 against the Connecticut Sun, Seattle Storm, New York Liberty and Las Vegas Aces. However, against the Chicago Sky, Los Angeles Sparks, Mystics and Atlanta Dream, they are 5-1.\n\nThat tells me that the Fever are starting to find their footing against teams on their level despite playing a tough schedule to open the season.\n\nWashington has struggled on the offensive end more than anything in 2024, ranking dead last in the W in offensive rating, and I think that benefits the Fever. Indiana's Achilles heel has been on the defensive end, but it held on to beat this Washington team earlier this month.\n\nI'll lay the points with the Fever at home against a team on their level.\n\nPick: Fever -4.5 (-110)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Mystics vs. Fever Prediction, Odds and Key Players for WNBA on Wednesday, June 19.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_dewey@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Peter Dewey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaliyah_Edwards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaliyah Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakira_Austin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shakira Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/ohy6iv/picture289386444/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/b08303df-a1c8-41e7-8091-6e0fb8a870b0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 2525, "textEnd": 2532}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Indiana is in the playoff race, sitting at eighth with a 6-10 record.\n\nAnd they're approaching something they haven't accomplished in nine years: four straight wins.\n\nIndiana last won four in a row in 2015, when the Tulsa Shock still existed and Indiana legend Tamika Catchings was still playing. The Fever will go for four in a row Friday at Atlanta -- a team they beat earlier this week,\n\nYes, all of their wins so far have come against bottom-half teams in the WNBA, including the Dream, Chicago Sky and Washington Mystics. But stacking wins is crucial for a young team like the Fever, and they're doing it well.\n\nFor the second straight game, each of Indiana's top four players finished the game in double-figures: Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchel each had 22, Caitlin Clark had 18 and NaLyssa Smith had 11. While it's the second straight game this has happened, it's still just the second time the Fever have been able to get all of its stars -- two No. 1 picks and two No. 2 picks -- able to jell together.\n\nClark and Boston's pick-and-roll and post-entry game is also continuing to develop: Boston started the game 3-for-3 from the field while Clark started with three assists. Clark flirted with a triple-double on Wednesday for the second consecutive game too, finishing with 16 points, 12 rebounds and six assists.\n\nWith 11 games in 20 days, the Fever had a tough start to the season with little rest and little practice time. Now, with four games in 16 days, Indiana has had time to practice new offensive schemes and learn how to work together with game experience to back it up.\n\nWatch out, Fever second-year center Aliyah Boston could become a threat beyond the arc.\n\nBoston came to the Fever as a post that played nearly always in the paint, but she needed to have at least somewhat of a 3-point range -- in case of emergencies. She showed her 3-point range last season in a July game against the Liberty -- a last-second 3-pointer tied the score, forcing overtime against a top WNBA team. That time, she jumped into her teammates arms in celebration.\n\nThis year, it's becoming more normal for the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week. Boston found herself open beyond the arc, got the ball, positioned her feet just beyond the 3-point line, and launched the ball toward the net. Swish. The Fever bench jumped up in celebration as Boston casually ran back on defense.\n\nThis season, she's 4-for-10 in her limited attempts beyond the arc.

Clark has a smooth jumper with impressive range but also excels at finding her open teammates. The attention she draws from defenses opens things up for others. Clark leads the team in points (16.1), assists (6.2) and steals (1.3). In her last outing, she finished with 23 points, eight rebounds, nine assists, and shot 7-of-11 from the field.\n\nForward Aliyah Boston is taking her game to another level recently. She has dominated in the frontcourt for the Fever as a rebounder and creating second-chance opportunities. She logs 12.3 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game. On June 16 against the Sky, Boston stuffed the stat sheet with 19 points, 14 rebounds, four assists and five blocks. See which side to back at SportsLine.\n\nWhy the Mystics can cover\n\nGuard Ariel Atkins is a reliable three-level scorer for the Mystics. Atkins has the strength to absorb contact in the lane while knocking down shots on the perimeter. The Texas product leads the team in both points (14.6) and steals (1.6) to go along with 3.4 assists per game. In her previous contest, Atkins totaled 29 points, three rebounds and three dimes.\n\nForward Aaliyah Edwards provides Washington with a two-way threat in the frontcourt. Edwards is an active defender with a soft touch around the rim. The 2024 sixth-overall pick averages 9.1 points and 6.4 rebounds per game. She's scored in double figures in four of her last six outings. On June 7 against the Fever, Edwards had 10 points and 12 boards.

And that's just what's happening for our team right now.\"\n\nFour Fever players scored in double-figures, including rookie guard Caitlin Clark.\n\n\"Taking good shots and helping our teammates take good shots I think was the key,\" Clark said. \"Only giving up one o-board (offensive rebound) in the second half was huge as well.\"\n\nClark nearly had a triple-double in the victory. She finished with 23 points, 9 assists and 8 rebounds. She was 7-of-11 (63.6%) from the field. It was her best field goal percentage this season in a game.\n\nHer performance was just a sample of what the Fever offense looked like on Sunday. As a team, Indiana was efficient, shooting 35-of-62 (56.5%) from the field. That helped lead to 91 points. In fact, Indiana has scored 91 points in each of its last two victories.\n\n\"I think the 90+ points come from pace obviously getting up and down the floor, but defensively, being sound enough to go back on the o-end (offensive end),\" Indiana guard Kelsey Mitchell said.\n\nIt's been a big turnaround for Indiana since its slow start to the season, in which it lost eight of its first nine games.\n\nThe Fever has now won three of its last four games.\n\n\"They're learning each other,\" Sides said. \"This is what's happening right now - they're learning each other. They're learning how to play off each other. They're recognizing reads off each other.\"\n\nSure, the schedule has gotten a bit easier since the difficult slate to start the year, but Sides is still impressed by what she's seeing from her team.\n\n\"They're way more resilient than I thought they were,\" Sides said. \"We keep using that word.\"\n\nIndiana is back in action on Wednesday against the Washington Mystics.

On Wednesday night, the former Iowa Hawkeyes superstar put on a show, as she played a huge role in the Fever beating the Washington Mystics at home to the tune of an 88-81 score.\n\nClark finished the contest with 18 points to go with 12 rebounds. With those numbers, she was able to reach a statistical territory not seen in the WNBA since 2007, according to StatMamba.\n\n\"Caitlin Clark is the first rookie guard to have multiple double-doubles in a season since 2007.\"\n\nClark's other double-double game to date this season took place during a 78-73 win on the road against the Los Angeles Sparks back in May where she had 11 points and 10 rebounds while adding eight assists and four steals. Everyone knows Clark can get buckets, but her ability to create space for her teammates and find them for scoring opportunities are among the other abilities that make her so dangerous of an offensive weapon. Clark is also showing great effort on defense, as she is leading the Fever in steals and even has multiple multi-block games.\n\nProducing great numbers and getting wins at the same time further underscores Clark's importance to the Fever, who have now improved to 6-10 on the season.\n\nIn addition to her double-digit scoring and rebounding production against the Mystics, Clark also dished out six dimes and racked up four steals while shooting 6/12 from the floor and going 2/6 from behind the arc in 27 minutes of impressive play. The top overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft appears to be adjusting just fine in the pros, generally speaking, and she's probably only barely scratching the surface of her full potential.\n\nCaitlin Clark wasn't the only Fever who came up with a solid performance in the Mystics game.\n\nKelsey Mitchell and Aliyah Boston each had 22 points and combined for 11 rebounds. As a team, the Fever shot 50.8 percent from the field and went 8/23 from deep.\n\nNow on a three-game win streak, Clark and the Fever will look to keep the good times going when they start a road trip on Friday versus the Atlanta Dream.\n\nCaitlin Clark's latest feat has fans going bonkers\n\nThanks to her big game against the Mystics, Clark has become a hit again on social media, with fans praising her nonstop again.\n\n\"Rookie of the Year\"\n\n\"I thought one WNBA player said that all Clark did was shoot threes and the league is so hard that Clark is struggling, so this can't be true because many of the other amazing superstars (can't remember any of their names rn) probably did this several times.

Clark leads the team in points (16.1), assists (6.2) and steals (1.3). In her last outing, she finished with 23 points, eight rebounds, nine assists, and shot 7-of-11 from the field.\n\nForward Aliyah Boston is taking her game to another level recently. She has dominated in the frontcourt for the Fever as a rebounder and creating second-chance opportunities. She logs 12.3 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game. On June 16 against the Sky, Boston stuffed the stat sheet with 19 points, 14 rebounds, four assists and five blocks. See which side to back at SportsLine.\n\nWhy the Mystics can cover\n\nGuard Ariel Atkins is a reliable three-level scorer for the Mystics. Atkins has the strength to absorb contact in the lane while knocking down shots on the perimeter. The Texas product leads the team in both points (14.6) and steals (1.6) to go along with 3.4 assists per game. In her previous contest, Atkins totaled 29 points, three rebounds and three dimes.\n\nForward Aaliyah Edwards provides Washington with a two-way threat in the frontcourt. Edwards is an active defender with a soft touch around the rim. The 2024 sixth-overall pick averages 9.1 points and 6.4 rebounds per game. She's scored in double figures in four of her last six outings. On June 7 against the Fever, Edwards had 10 points and 12 boards.

Indiana is in the playoff race, sitting at eighth with a 6-10 record.\n\nAnd they're approaching something they haven't accomplished in nine years: four straight wins.\n\nIndiana last won four in a row in 2015, when the Tulsa Shock still existed and Indiana legend Tamika Catchings was still playing. The Fever will go for four in a row Friday at Atlanta -- a team they beat earlier this week,\n\nYes, all of their wins so far have come against bottom-half teams in the WNBA, including the Dream, Chicago Sky and Washington Mystics. But stacking wins is crucial for a young team like the Fever, and they're doing it well.\n\nFever core four continue to jell\n\nFor the second straight game, each of Indiana's top four players finished the game in double-figures: Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchel each had 22, Caitlin Clark had 18 and NaLyssa Smith had 11. While it's the second straight game this has happened, it's still just the second time the Fever have been able to get all of its stars -- two No. 1 picks and two No. 2 picks -- able to jell together.\n\nClark and Boston's pick-and-roll and post-entry game is also continuing to develop: Boston started the game 3-for-3 from the field while Clark started with three assists. Clark flirted with a triple-double on Wednesday for the second consecutive game too, finishing with 16 points, 12 rebounds and six assists.\n\nWith 11 games in 20 days, the Fever had a tough start to the season with little rest and little practice time. Now, with four games in 16 days, Indiana has had time to practice new offensive schemes and learn how to work together with game experience to back it up.\n\nAliyah Boston showcases 3-point range\n\nWatch out, Fever second-year center Aliyah Boston could become a threat beyond the arc.\n\nBoston came to the Fever as a post that played nearly always in the paint, but she needed to have at least somewhat of a 3-point range -- in case of emergencies. She showed her 3-point range last season in a July game against the Liberty -- a last-second 3-pointer tied the score, forcing overtime against a top WNBA team. That time, she jumped into her teammates arms in celebration.\n\nThis year, it's becoming more normal for the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week. Boston found herself open beyond the arc, got the ball, positioned her feet just beyond the 3-point line, and launched the ball toward the net. Swish. The Fever bench jumped up in celebration as Boston casually ran back on defense.\n\nThis season, she's 4-for-10 in her limited attempts beyond the arc. It's a new part of her game, and it's something that could become a threat to opposing teams.\n\nHow many points did Caitlin Clark score?\n\nCaitlin Clark scored 18 points and led the Fever in rebounding with 12 boards. She also added six assists with six turnovers.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Shock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tulsa Shock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamika_Catchings", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamika Catchings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(WNBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (WNBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/20/PIND/74152514007-2-jt-08107.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5570,3133,x0,y348&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The Mystics are looking to bounce back after a tough start, with Ariel Atkins showing strong performances. Betting trends lean towards Fever covering the spread and the game being under the projected total points.\n\nThe 2023-24 WNBA season is in full swing, with a quarter of the season in the books. One of the games on tap from today's slate features the Indiana Fever (5-10 SU, 7-8 ATS) hosting the Washington Mystics (2-12 SU, 8-5-1 ATS).\n\nHere is a look at which squad has the edge in this matchup and why.\n\nFever vs. Mystics Game Info\n\nWhen\n\nWed. June 19\n\nWhere\n\nGainbridge Fieldhouse\n\nTime\n\n7:00 PM EST\n\nLocation\n\nIndianapolis, IN\n\nTV\n\nNBA TV, BSIN, and MNMTS\n\nFever vs. Mystics - Season Stats & Betting Trends The Fever are the favorite vs. Washington\n\nThe Fever entered the 2024 campaign hoping to snap a seven-year playoff drought. Unfortunately, reality hit really quickly, with the team dropping its first five games while producing just three wins across its first 13 outings. Fortunately, things have gone a little bit better lately.\n\nIndiana comes into this matchup with back-to-back wins over the Atlanta Dream (91-84) and the Chicago Sky (91-83). In the team's win over the Sky on Sunday, Caitlin Clark endured another physical battle against Chicago en route to scoring a team-high 23 points on an efficient 7-for-11 effort from the field. Clark also went 3-for-7 from deep and tallied nine assists and eight rebounds.\n\n\"I think we're moving the ball, and I think once we gave it up, people were getting it back in the half-court. I thought we were really good out of the ball-screen action. I thought we made some really good reads.\" - Caitlin Clark\n\nAliyah Boston added 19 points and 14 rebounds (including six on the offensive glass), marking her second double-double in as many nights. NaLyssa Smith finished with 15 points and seven rebounds, while Kelsey Mitchell contributed 17 points, four rebounds, and two assists for a Fever squad that posted consecutive victories for the first time this season.\n\nOn the other side of this matchup, the Mystics have had their fair share of struggles, to say the least. They kicked off their season with 12 straight losses. Nope. That is not a misprint. But they have two things in common with Indiana. First, they have posted wins in each of their last two contests. Second, their most recent win was also over the Chicago Sky by a narrow 83-81 margin.\n\nIn that contest, Ariel Atkins led Washington with 29 points, on 9-for-13 shooting from the floor and was 2-for-5 from beyond the arc. She also had three rebounds and three assists. Rookie forward Aliyah Edwards added 16 points and nine boards, while Kate Samuelson finished with 12 points and two assists.\n\nWashington led by as many as 15 points before the Sky rallied to trim the deficit to 83-81 in the closing seconds. But Marina Mabrey missed a pair of free throws, enabling the Mystics to hold on for their second win of the season.\n\nNow that we have set the stage for this Eastern Conference matchup, let's examine the betting trends for both sides.\n\nFever vs. Mystics Picks GIVEMESPORT presents our picks with analysis Spread\n\nThanks in part to their recent back-to-back victories, the Indiana Fever enter this matchup as a 4.5-point favorite (via OddShark.com. Here is a look at how both ball clubs have fared against the spread this season.\n\nThe Fever are 3-6 ATS in their last nine games. In its last eight contests, Indiana is 6-2 against the spread. The Mystics are 4-1 ATS in their last five outings. Washington is 4-2 ATS in its last six road games. In their last eight \"road\" matchups against Indiana, the Mystics are 2-6 against the spread. Prediction: Indiana Fever (-4.5) Over/Under\n\nThe projected over/under total for this matchup is 166 points (per BleacherNation.com). Here is why going with the \"under\" is the smart choice.\n\nThe total has gone UNDER four times in the Fever's last five home games against Washington. The UNDER total is 3-2 in the previous five head-to-head matchups between these teams. Indiana and Washington average a combined 155.4 points per game, which is 10.6 points lower than the over/under for this matchup. Prediction: UNDER 166 points Player Prop Bets\n\nFollowing her game-high 29 points in the team's last outing, combined with the fact that she leads her team in scoring and steals, Ariel Atkins is the key player to watch for the Mystics. She currently has -110 odds of scoring more than 15.5 points and -120 odds of finishing with less than 15.5 points (via DraftKings)\n\nDo Atkins' numbers favorably compare to the estimated points total for this matchup? Let's look at the tale of the tape to find out.\n\nDuring the season, Atkins is averaging 14.6 points per contest. In her lone matchup against the Fever this season, Atkins scored 16 points on 7-for-21 shooting from the field. Atkins has suited up against Eastern Conference teams 10 times this season.

Furthermore, she leads the Fever in scoring, assists, and steals, thus making her the key player to watch for the home team. She currently has -120 odds of scoring more than 17.5 points and -110 odds of finishing with less than 17.5 points.\n\nHere is a look at how her numbers stack up against the projected points total for this matchup.\n\nDuring the season, Clark is averaging 16.1 points per contest.

The idea that the Fever had a remotely realistic shot at a playoff berth seemed dubious at best three weeks ago. The Fever were buried in the standings, one of the two worst teams in the league along with the team they face in this game, the Washington Mystics. Indiana was 1-8 after two and a half weeks of regular-season play. The Fever have obvious flaws and limitations on their roster. It's clear this organization needs to retool and give Caitlin Clark more help next season. However, there was real doubt if the current roster could evolve to the point where the playoffs were even a possibility. This team was bad in the first two and a half weeks of the season. Its skill was questioned, but also its toughness and heart.\n\nWhere everything seemed to change for this team was in the one-point win over the Chicago Sky on June 1. The Fever gutted out a tough game, and Clark defeated the other high-profile WNBA rookie in this draft class, Angel Reese. There was a controversial, hard foul committed by the Sky against Clark in that game, but while that got a lot of national attention, what really mattered was that the Fever found a way to win that contest. It gave the team confidence which has grown in recent games. The Fever just did beat the Sky a second time in another close game. They won a tough game versus these same Mystics in Washington. They also defeated the Atlanta Dream. The Fever have learned how to take a punch and respond without flinching. Crucially, it's not just about Clark, either. Indiana is defending better, rebounding better, and being tougher in the final five minutes of games. Indiana now has a legitimate shot at the No. 8 playoff seed with the Dallas Wings, Chicago Sky, and Los Angeles Sparks all struggling in the lower tier of the WNBA.\n\nThe Mystics are getting 4.5 points against an opponent which is still one of the lower-tier teams in the WNBA. Indiana might win outright, but Washington has a great chance of keeping this game close enough to cover. The Mystics, like the Fever, beat the Chicago Sky in the past week. These two teams are fairly even. The point spread seems large.\n\nWhy The Fever Could Cover The Spread\n\nThe Fever are improving. Going 4-2 in their past six games speaks for itself. Also of note is that Washington's Brittney Sykes, who helped the Mystics beat the Atlanta Dream earlier in June for their first win of the regular season, is now back on the shelf with another injury (separate from the one which kept her out for the first few weeks of the season). That limitation could really hurt the Mystics and help the Fever.\n\nFinal Mystics-Fever Prediction & Pick\n\nTwo not-very-good teams meet with injury complications as part of the backdrop.

Wednesday night's sellout 88-81 win over the Washington Mystics matched the 2002 Mystics attendance.\n\nSo yes, the Fever beat the identical franchise 20-plus years later to tie an incredible turnout record to begin the season. It marked the Fever's third consecutive win to move to 6-10 and stay in the playoff picture. They'll probably get to nine home games at 15,000-plus too. The Fever will host the New York Liberty on July 6. Up next, they'll play five straight road games and look to survive it.\n\nBut all the Fever have been doing lately is surviving, with three single-digit wins all at home.\n\n\"This is the true definition of home-court advantage,\" Fever forward Aliyah Boston said on the court to fans postgame. \"We feel the energy,\" Boston later said to reporters. \"We're just thankful that they continue to show up and that they're super loud because we're playing hard for them.\"\n\nBoston -- without the pink color in her hair anymore -- has continued to motor in the paint for the Fever. She tied to lead the team with 22 points Wednesday, shooting 8-for-11. Mystics rookie Aaliyah Edwards was held to only four points, making one basket. Kelsey Mitchell poured on another 22 points in the win. Caitlin Clark did most of the rebounding with 12 and scoring 18 points as well.\n\nShe was four assists shy of her first-career triple-double and probably would've gotten it had her teammates made more 3-pointers in the first half. But as you'll learn, the Fever are not in shape to throw teammates under the bus. Clark was instrumental in another win, though she did have more off-target and dangerous passes in the second half. She was later asked about it.\n\n\"There was a couple here and there,\" Clark said. \"One was a set design where I kinda just assumed Aliyah would be open and I didn't even really look before I threw it. So I think just slowing down a little bit. Honestly, I'm trying to remember the other ones.\"\n\nBoston interrupted.\n\n\"It's okay, it's alright, don't worry,\" Boston said. \"If I miss it, then alright, we're good.\"\n\n\"Thanks, AB,\" Clark replied.\n\nFor Caitlin Clark, Aliyah Boston, and the Fever, winning is fun\n\nWhen Boston interrupted, Clark and Mitchell both smirked and laughed at the podium. There have been tons of smiles and laughs inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse lately. Players just have hops in their steps. The trio at the podium walked off loose and happy. They've deserved this, following their 11-game 20-day gauntlet versus some of the best teams in the whole league.\n\nThey went to Indy's Zoobilation and the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials in between games.\n\nDuring another reporter's question, Mitchell was prefaced with this is the first time the Fever have won four straight home games since 2015, which was three years before her debut as the longest-tenured player. So, what's different about this team? Clark whispered to Boston that she was in seventh or eighth grade back then, even while Mitchell was starting to give her answer.\n\nWhat's next for Indiana\n\nIn spite of this perfect three-game homestand, the Atlanta Dream, Chicago Sky, and Mystics are in the bottom half of the standings. Wins are wins, but the real test is when the Fever have to go play at the Seattle Storm at the midway point of their road trip. They're 0-7 versus the New York Liberty, Connecticut Sun, and the Storm so far this year. When is the breakthrough win coming?\n\nTime will tell. But for now, the Fever are bonding, they're laughing -- they're winning.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_byrne@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matthew Byrne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaliyah_Edwards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaliyah Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Caitlin-Clark-Aliyah-Boston-fuel-historic-sellout-game-vs.-Mystics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 586, "textEnd": 592}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

But as her head coach Christie Sides hinted, it's just the beginning.\n\nThe Fever sharpshooter was sensational in the showdown, finishing with a near triple-double of 23 points, eight rebounds and nine assists. She was also a pest on defense with three blocked shots.\n\nWith Clark leading the way, the Fever took the 91-83 win to surpass the Sky in the standings.\n\nIn their postgame presser, Sides spoke about Clark's performance and shared her belief that the former Iowa Hawkeyes star is finally getting more comfortable playing with her new teammates.\n\n\"Caitlin Clark is a phenomenal player, and the more she's in the league ... she's getting more and more comfortable,\" Sides explained, via The Athletic.\n\n\"She's getting more and more comfortable with her teammates. She spent four years with her Iowa teammates, and they did great things. They had some great team chemistry, and I think she's having those moments with her new teammates.\"\n\nSure enough, it's a proclamation that will make the Fever's WNBA rivals worried. Indiana needed six games to get their first win of the season (against the Los Angeles Sparks). In the nine outings they had since then, they have won four.\n\nWhile the Fever still have a lot of work to do, it's clear that they have made major strides compared to when the season started. And as Christie Sides highlighted, it's thanks in large part to Caitlin Clark adjusting to their system and building chemistry with her teammates.\n\nAs the Fever continue to play more games, they should only get better with Clark leading the way.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark's Powerful Message After Angel Reese Accusation Is Going Viral", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angelo_guinhawa@postandcourier.com", "name": "Angelo Guinhawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Block (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/7e/b7e7170e-509a-5bf6-90c2-1a03e631561d/6670318ae5b4d.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The Fever came out with a team effort, as Caitlin Clark posted a double-double, while Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchell both scored a team-high 22 points.\n\nThe Fever seem to have found the answer. They're playing their offense through Boston and are no longer resorting to isolation basketball or set plays out of the break.\n\nOne of the major differences between now and the beginning of the season is also the chemistry of Clark and Boston. Clark spoke on one particular play in the win against the Mystics where she found Boston in the paint for an easy layup.\n\n\"I kinda assumed Aliyah was gonna be open and I didn't even really look... so I think just slowing down... honestly, I'm trying to remember the other ones,\" said Clark via Matthew Byrne on X.\n\nClark's facilitating has been exquisite as of late. She finished the game on Wednesday night with 18 points, 12 rebounds, and six assists. Clark leads all rookies in terms of average points and assists per game, jolting those numbers even more against Washington. She's averaging 16.1 points and 6.2 assists through the year.\n\nBoston also chimed into Clark's quote, telling the rookie not to worry about an extension. Fans online raved about the interview, saying Boston is \"comfortable again.\"\n\n\"It's okay, it's alright. Don't worry,\" said Boston.\n\nIndiana now moves to 6-10 on the year, with their star duo growing through the season.\n\nRelated: Nika Muhl's Powerful Message Draws Caitlin Clark, Cameron Brink's Attention\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark's Pregame Outfit Ahead Of Fever-Mystics Is Turning Heads", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Wheeler_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erica Wheeler (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arike_Ogunbowale", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arike Ogunbowale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Park_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Park Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/ef/9ef85dba-121a-5c35-b1b1-b1673dafd4ab/6673a2a477fa1.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C60&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

While their slow start surprised some, Indiana has done incredibly well to bounce back and go on a bit of a run, and it has had a lot to do with the incredible play of Clark.\n\nClark made WNBA history in this game by becoming the first player since 2007 with multiple double-doubles in a rookie campaign. Also making history with her overall stat line, Clark became the first rookie in league history with at least 18 points, 12 rebounds, six assists, and four steals in a game.\n\nClark continues to make history like this in her young career, but more importantly, the Fever are starting to win games. There have been some ups and downs for Clark to start her WNBA career, but she has done incredibly well to bounce back every single time she has struggled.\n\nOn a great run right now, Clark is seemingly making WNBA history on a nightly basis, and did so again in this win over the Mystics.\n\nAlso doing a great job handling the outside noise that constantly surrounds her, Clark remains focused on basketball, and is playing at a very high level right now. As previously mentioned, the focus is wins, and Indiana continues to pick them up.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark Makes WNBA History in Indiana Fever vs. Chicago Sky\n\nRelated: WNBA Makes Major Announcement After Indiana Fever vs. Chicago Sky Game", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/a5/7a5954fe-2e00-547b-91c0-0d2c4df22027/6673929b86946.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C66&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Boston, a former South Carolina Gamecocks standout, tallied 22 points on 8 of 11 shooting, eight rebounds, and two assists.\n\nDuring and after the game, WNBA fans took to social and gave Clark-Boston duo a new nickname: \"ABC\u00b2.\" The nickname stems from the duo's initials: Aliyah Boston (AB) and Caitlin Clark (CC or C\u00b2).\n\nClark, Boston, and the Fever will aim to extend their winning streak on Friday, June 21, as they head to Atlanta to take on the Dream.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark Olympic Status Trending After Cameron Brink Injury\n\nRelated: Indiana Fever Coach Has 'Sad' Reaction To Cameron Brink's Injury", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_phelps@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Gamecocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Gamecocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/61/361746ae-0f97-59aa-88fb-7e369a7f3b02/6673929bdba18.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 910, "textEnd": 917}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Aliyah Boston Records Third Straight Double-Double in Fever Win", "body": "Indiana Fever forward Aliyah Boston / Grace Hollars/IndyStar / USA TODAY\n\nAliyah Boston seems to be finding her rhythm. Last year's WNBA Rookie of the Year struggled to start the 2024 season, but has recently restored her dominance on the court, posting double-double performances in three consecutive games.\n\nBoston scored 19 points, collected 14 rebounds, blocked five shots and dished out four assists in the Indiana Fever's 91-83 victory over the Chicago Sky on Sunday. She was also nine-of-13 from the floor and played 39 minutes.\n\nIndiana's win on Sunday marked the first time all season the Fever won back-to-back games. Make no mistake, Boston's dominance in the post has been a big reason why.\n\nThe second-year star out of South Carolina had a strong performance in an 89-72 blowout loss to the Connecticut Sun on June 10. But the aspect from that game that stood out was that Boston was the only starter who wasn't benched by coach Christie Sides for a lack of effort.\n\nBoston then carried that momentum into the following game, scoring a season-high 27 points and grabbing 13 boards in the Fever's 91-84 victory over the Atlanta Dream. She shot 12-of-21 from the floor.\n\nEven with back-to-back No. 1 overall picks in Boston and Caitlin Clark on the roster, there have been some growing pains for Indiana early in the 2024 season. The Fever still sit at just 5-10 on the season, but won back-to-back games for the first time all season and are winners in four of their last five games.\n\nThe improving chemistry and connection between Boston and Clark is a big reason for the recent success.\n\nBoston is averaging 12.3 points, 7.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.2 blocks per game this season. It took some time, but she's starting to look like the WNBA All-Star she was a season ago. And it's coming along at a great time.\n\nIndiana has a real chance to make some noise over these next three games, playing the Washington Mystics (2-12), Atlatna Dream (6-6) and Chicago Sky (4-9). So far this season, the Fever are a perfect 4-0 against those three teams this season.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5929,h_3335,x_0,y_446/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastbreak/01j0kt6rqt5m9ch4gsy1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 823, "textEnd": 830}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

When pondering any Mystics vs. Fever predictions, considering Caitlin Clark's recent struggles furthers belief in the Mystics.\n\nMy analysis\n\nDespite currently sitting in playoff position at No. 8 in the WNBA -- and yes, it is much too soon to speculate about playoff chances -- the Indiana Fever are dead-last in net rating. Worse yet, the second-lowest ranked team -- the Washington Mystics -- are 4.7 points better per 100 possessions. The Mystics are nearly as close to the No. 7 net rating as they are to the Fever at No. 12.\n\nThat has not shown up in the standings, with Washington going 2-12 straight-up and sitting dead-last in the WNBA. But some of that struggle has come from scheduling as the Mystics have played the Top 4 teams in the standings a total of seven times, going 0-7 outright.\n\nThe Fever have played those teams a total of eight times, going 0-8 outright.\n\nThese distinctions matter. Those four teams -- the Sun, Liberty, Lynx, and Storm by standings and Sun, Lynx, Liberty, and Storm by net rating -- are far and away better than the rest of the WNBA. Seattle's net rating of +5.6 is 4.4 points better than No. 5, the Aces. The difference between the Aces and No. 7 is less than that.\n\nSo look at how Indiana and Washington have fared against the seven other teams in the WNBA that are far from elite. The Fever have a -2 point differential in those seven games despite going 5-2 outright, while the Mystics break even in point differential in their seven games despite going 2-5 outright.\n\nVery basic metrics like net ratings and point differentials are more informative than win-loss records. Trusting them suggests Washington is better than Indiana.\n\nWhen playing in Indianapolis, the Fever should still be favored, but not by this much.\n\nMy best bet\n\nCaitlin Clark Under 2.5 made 3s (+118 at FanDuel)\n\nMy analysis\n\nCaitlin Clark was not exactly setting the world afire to start the season, but she did go 24 of 75 (32%) from deep in her first nine games, clearing this prop in five of them.\n\nSince then, she has cracked this prop just twice in six games. One of those, though, was against these same Mystics on June 7, going 7 of 13 from deep.\n\nIn her five other games this month, Clark has shot just 9-for-34 (26.5%) from beyond the arc. It may be fatigue, it may be better scouting. Whatever it is, Clark has fallen off.\n\nFurthermore, Washington defends the arc well, ranking No. 8 in the WNBA in 3-pointers attempted against per game.\n\nClark exploding two weeks ago was an anomaly, as was the Mystics getting exploited from deep. That should not happen again.\n\nThe Fever are undone by their defense, worst in the WNBA by 5.7 points per 100 possessions. The difference between No. 11 and the Fever is less than the difference between No. 11 and No. 5. Indiana's defense will be considered historically bad by season's end.\n\nThe Mystics' offense struggles, but it is not as disastrously bad as the Fever's defense is. Indiana may make Washington look competent offensively, which should be enough to crack this total.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Over has cashed in five straight Fever games and by an average of 5.2 points per game.

After a 1-8 start, the team has now won five of its last seven games.\n\nAs you might expect, Fever fans were hype following the victory and pundits were impressed by the winning streak:\n\nThe continued evolution of Clark has played a big role in that streak, though she's had plenty of help. Aliyah Boston chipped in with 22 points and eight boards on Wednesday, while Kelsey Mitchell had 22 points of her own.\n\nAriel Atkins did everything she could to keep the Mystics in the game, leading all scorers with 27 points, but her teammates couldn't match that pace.\n\nSuddenly, the Fever can realistically think about the possibility of a playoff push. Granted, there's a lot of season left to be played, but Indiana currently holds the No. 8 seed and appear to be settling into a nice groove.\n\nClark continues to play well, though she has plenty of room for growth. Turnovers remain an issue (six against the Mystics) and she hasn't hit on her three-pointers at the expected rate (32.8 percent coming into Wednesday night).\n\nBut the Fever are learning how to better play as a unit, and the win over the Mystics was a good indication of how dangerous they could be when they start hitting on all cylinders.

Another questionable foul. Another impressive performance.\n\nAnd -- somewhat improbably, given how the season started -- another win for WNBA star Caitlin Clark and her Indiana Fever teammates.\n\nAccording to basketball outlet The Spun, Clark managed 18 points and 12 rebounds -- the latter a career high -- in an 88-81 win over the Washington Mystics on Wednesday.\n\nAs ESPN noted, that brings Clark ever closer to becoming the first WNBA rookie to ever amass a triple-double -- double-digit tallies in scores, rebounds and assists in a single game. With six assists on Wednesday, she was four short of notching that first.\n\nShe's also the first rookie in 16 years to have two consecutive games with 15 points, five rebounds and five assists. (The Los Angeles Sparks' Candace Parker, now a leftist commentator, was the last to do it in 2008.)\n\nBut perhaps most impressively, the Fever, which started out 0-5 and looking every bit like they were in prime contention for the No. 1 draft pick for a third straight year, are now 6-10 with three straight victories.\n\nPart of that is chalked up Clark's improving rapport with Aliyah Boston, last year's WNBA Rookie of the Year, who co-led the team Wednesday with 22 points.\n\nGuard Kelsey Mitchell also managed to put up 22 in the win.\n\n\"You can even see me and Aliyah just having a better connection, reading where each other's going to be, reading each other's eyes a little bit better,\" Clark told The Washington Post prior to Wednesday's contest.\n\n\"It's just the connection. You build that through playing together. ... Everybody can kind of see the improvement.\"\n\nThe win keeps the Fever in the eighth and final playoff spot in the young WNBA season.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most impressive statistic of the night: 17,274. That's the capacity crowd at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. The social media post below gives some highlights of the performance they saw:\n\nTo be fair, the Mystics are not the best competition to Clark the WNBA has to offer. The team fell to 2-13 after Wednesday night's game. Guard Ariel Atkins was the top scorer for the Mystics with 27 points on 10-17 from the field.\n\nAnd, it wouldn't be a signature Caitlin Clark win without a questionable non-call on what looked very much like a foul, this one from Mystics center Stefanie Dolson:\n\nAs anyone who's played any amount of rec basketball will tell you, if you try to \"block a shot\" and don't even come close to touching the ball -- in this case, Dolson seemed to grab a whole lot more of Clark's arm than anything else -- you'll normally get hit with a foul and the other player will be at the line. Alas, c'est Caitlin Clark.\n\nAt least Angel Reese wasn't celebrating from the sidelines this time around:\n\nSpeaking of Reese, get your popcorn ready, because Clark's Fever and Reese's Chicago Sky are playing again on Sunday, this time on ESPN.\n\nLast Sunday's game between the two rookie sensations was the most watched WNBA game in 23 years with 2.25 million viewers, according to ABC News. The Fever won that contest 91-83.\n\nGiven that no love is lost between the two squads and they both currently hold the eighth and ninth seeds in the WNBA standings, they may manage to give those numbers a run for their money, even on cable.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_douglas_golden@westernjournal.com", "name": "C.

The Fever, who had 10 free throws in the first half, had 11 in the third quarter, helping them to a 68-59 lead.\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Engstler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emily Engstler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakira_Austin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shakira Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Wheeler_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erica Wheeler (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Atkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ariel Atkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlie_Samuelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karlie Samuelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittney_Sykes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brittney Sykes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanie_Dolson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefanie Dolson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b87268c4-7873-11e7-af9a-f3a04545878a.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The team looks to keep their hot streak alive during a game against Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever on Wednesday.\n\nThe worst start in franchise history is in the rearview mirror for the Mystics' players. They say their routines haven't changed -- the wins have just started flowing.\n\n\"I don't think we've done anything differently than what we did the day we got here,\" guard Ariel Atkins said after Friday's win against the Chicago Sky. \"We've been doing what we need to do as far as the foundation of who we are, and it's showing. We've got two wins now.\"\n\nWhen the Mystics visit the Fever on Wednesday, they'll be looking to avenge one of the toughest losses of the young season, an 85-83 heartbreaker at Capital One Arena on June 7.\n\nThe game, which sold out the 20,000-seat home of the Washington Wizards, came down to the wire. Clark caught fire, draining a rookie-record seven three-pointers, but the Mystics only trailed by two as the clock ticked down in the fourth quarter.\n\nAtkins had a shot at a potential game-winning buzzer-beater, but she couldn't beat the clock.\n\n\"We have to do a better job obviously on Caitlin Clark. We let her get the threes,\" Thibault said ahead of Wednesday's game. \"Sometimes, it's just you've seen it once and being able to realize some individual tendencies a little bit better.\"\n\nBut Indiana isn't a one-woman squad, Thibault noted.\n\n\"There's other people that hurt us in that game too,\" the 36-year-old coach said.\n\n\"They're a good offensive team, I think it's taking away what they like to do,\" guard Karlie Samuelson told reporters on Tuesday. \"Obviously, Caitlin [Clark] had a big game against us last time, but other people on their team are playing really well.\"\n\nSamuelson noted that the Mystics' defense will closely monitor Fever forward Aliyah Boston. The reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year is averaging 20 points per game over her last three starts after a slow opening to the season.\n\n\"Aliyah Boston is playing a lot better since the last time we played them,\" forward Myisha Hines-Allen said. \"They're running a lot more plays through her.\n\nWashington has had ample time to gameplan for the Fever -- the squad benefitted from a four-day break after playing six games in 11 days.\n\n\"The run we've been on ... we've just shown some really good resilience,\" Thibault said on Friday.\n\nThe second-year coach attributed the squad's toughness to Atkins. The two-time All-Star leads the team in scoring and has provided a vital leadership presence in the locker room.\n\n\"She kind of worked through the rough patches she had a couple weeks ago. ...\" Thibault said. \"She's put our team on her back kind of emotionally, mentally as much as anything.\"\n\nThe Mystics aren't the only ones who have found a rhythm after an inauspicious start.\n\nThe Fever opened the season 1-8, leading to a flood of speculation about whether Clark could match her record-breaking collegiate production at the next level.\n\nClark says she knew adjusting to the WNBA would be difficult. She just needed some time.\n\n\"One of the biggest things to learn as I go through my rookie season is just finding some consistency,\" Clark said, according to the Indianapolis Star. \"And obviously, it's been hard. It's been a tough stretch at the beginning ... but I feel like I have gotten more comfortable over the course of these games.\"\n\nPowered by their rookie guard, the Fever have won four of their last six games.

Caitlin Clark may be among the most hyped athletes in the country, but Thibault knows well there's more to that team than the NCAA's all-time leading scorer.\n\nClark is only the latest No. 1 overall pick on the Fever roster. She joined former South Carolina star Aliyah Boston from 2023, and that pair joined two No. 2 overall picks in NaLyssa Smith and Kelsey Mitchell. That quartet combined for 73 points as the Fever beat the Mystics, 88-81, before a capacity crowd of 17,274 at Gainsbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nAfter an 0-5 start, the Fever have won three straight and five of seven, improving to 6-10. The Mystics (2-13), who endured an 0-12 start, saw their two-game winning streak end.\n\n\"Definitely time [together helps],\" Clark said before the game. \"You can even see me and Aliyah just having a better connection, reading where each other's going to be, reading each other's eyes a little bit better.\n\n\"It's just the connection. You build that through playing together. ... Everybody can kind of see the improvement.\"\n\nThe Mystics' progress has been slowed by injuries, with two of their biggest contributors missing extended time. Brittney Sykes (left foot sprain) missed her 12th game and Shakira Austin (hip) missed her ninth. Their absences are felt especially on offense, where Ariel Atkins (27 points) and Karlie Samuelson (16 points) could have used some help beyond the 14 points Stef Dolson contributed (including four three-pointers).\n\nAtkins has been on a tear the past three games, averaging 24.7 points, and now ranks No. 4 in franchise history with 450 career assists.\n\n\"That's the key, is not to force it,\" Atkins said. \"To make all of our lives easier, I have to be aggressive. Also with [Sykes] being out, we need to attack the rim a little more. Just trying to put pressure on the rim, open up stuff for us.\"\n\nWashington kept the Fever lead to single digits most of the night until a 12-3 fourth-quarter run built an 11-point advantage. The Mystics never got closer than seven the rest of the way.\n\nClark scored a career-high 30 points in the first meeting between the two teams, but put together a more all-around game this time with 18 points, a career-high 12 rebounds, six assists and four steals to go with six turnovers. Boston set the tone early and finished with 22 points and eight rebounds while Mitchell dropped 22 on 8-for-11 shooting, including four three-pointers. Smith added 11 points and seven rebounds.\n\n\"We chased shooters hard and maybe didn't guard the ball well enough,\" Thibault said. \"First half, in particular, we gave up a lot of straight-line drives because we were so busy chasing shooters around off the ball. That's tough because you have to give respect to those shooters, but I don't think we did a good job just with our one-on-one defense.\"\n\nThose are high-level scorers and the Mystics helped them out with some freebies. Eleven turnovers wasn't a huge number, but the Fever went the other way with them and scored 20 points off turnovers compared to just 10 for the Mystics. That 10-point differential looms large in a seven-point loss. Adding to the Mystics' issues was a propensity for fouling, and the Fever went 18 for 23 from the line.\n\n\"Some of the turnovers were basically outlets for a fast break layup,\" Samuelson said. \"Can't have a live turnover at the top of the key.\"\n\nWashington has two more meetings against the Fever. On Wednesday, the team announced that its season-ending game against the Fever on Sept. 19 will be moved to Capital One Arena. The first meeting was also held there and sold out with 20,333 in attendance, making it the fifth-highest attended regular season game in WNBA history.\n\nThe Mystics now return home for a back-to-back against the Dallas Wings on Saturday and Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Fever are riding a three-game win streak, finally finding rhythm through different lineups.\n\nFollowing their five-day rest period about two weeks ago, head coach Christie Sides has the team on another level. Their chemistry continues to get better, and it's clearly visible in their improvements.\n\nDespite their recent success, there are still questions surrounding the physical play against Clark. The rookie has been involved in a couple of altercations, like hard hits from Chennedy Carter and Breanna Stewart.\n\nShe was hit against the Mystics yet again on what fans are calling an \"obvious foul call\" via Ashwin on X.\n\nClark was driving into the paint when she was hit by the Mystics player.

Clark may have dealt with some physical play, but she still ended the game with 18 points, 12 rebounds, and six assists.\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark Gets Painfully Honest About Fever's 2024 Goal\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark, Aliyah Boston's Postgame Exchange Is Turning Heads", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohegan_Sun_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohegan Sun Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncasville,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncasville, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uncasville, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breanna_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breanna Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Mysticism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Mysticism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/77/677f8ddb-5884-5af0-a011-7dafb4076e27/6673b238617a8.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-06-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

They have won back-to-back games for the first time this season, and believe it or not, if the playoffs started today, the Fever would be in! Clark has looked more comfortable on the court and is putting up historically great numbers. She recently put up another game where she had at least 20 points, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds.\n\nIt was her 5th such game of the year, putting her in some select company in WNBA history. Clark is also setting more ratings records. Sunday's game between the Fever and the Chicago Sky was the most-watched WNBA game in 23 years! ESPN reports that the game featuring Clark and Angel Reese averaged 2.25 million viewers, up 225% from a comparable game last season.\n\nWith so much attention on Caitlin NOT making the U.S. Women's Olympic basketball team, there is a way to help her make another important team. The All-Star team! Voting is open for the WNBA All-Star game which will be played on Saturday, July 20th in Arizona. Fans can vote once every 24 hours at WNBA.com or on the WNBA app. Fans are allowed to select up to 10 players per device per day. Voting ends on Saturday, June 29th.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

She had another dominant game, controlling the paint on both ends of the floor.\n\nBut there was one thing she did for the first time in seven games: knock down a three-pointer. Katie Lou Samuelson threw her an overhead pass and Boston, without hesitation, let it fly from the left wing, and it was nothing but net.\n\nBoston had 22 points in the night on 8-11 shooting and a perfect 5-5 from the free throw line. It was her second 20 point game in her last three games.\n\n\"AB (Aliyah Boston) just got confidence,\" Fever head coach Christie Sides said. \"She got confidence after the Connecticut game. She went into business mode. She's just been business like and doing what this team needs.\"\n\nThe Fever never trailed despite the game remaining close throughout, and beat the Mystics 88-81.\n\nBoston was not alone on Wednesday night. Kelsey Mitchell also dropped 22 points on 8-11 shooting. Mitchell drilled four of her five three-point attempts, and was consistently getting downhill with impressive finishes at the rim.\n\nCaitlin Clark also played well offensively, putting up 18 points and knocked down two three-pointers. She recorded her second double-double of her career, grabbing 12 rebounds.\n\nTurnovers have been a problem for Clark so far this season and she had six more tonight. Some of them came on errant passes looking for Boston. But, Boston was quick to pick up Clark after the game.\n\n\"It's alright, don't worry,\" Boston said. \"I mean, you look at Caitlin and you look at the way she passes the ball, and so sometimes things are going to happen that way and that's okay because we're not going to let her hang her head. We're not going to hang our head off of any missed passes because we're still continuing to gel together and we know that she's a great passer. So if she thinks she can get that ball there, she's going to throw it. And if I miss it, then it's, we're good. We're alright.\"\n\nThis was the fourth home win in a row for the Fever, the first time that has happened since 2015. It is also their third win in a row overall.\n\nThe Fever are now 6-10 after starting the season 1-8 and are in sole possession of eighth place in the league standings, which would get them into the playoffs for the first time since 2016.\n\n\"I think everybody just loves instant satisfaction in our world,\" Clark said. \"No one came in here and said we were going to be WNBA champions from day one in our locker room.

Wednesday night marked their third straight victory, defeating the Washington Mystics 88-81 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse behind another strong performance.\n\nCaitlin Clark was at the center of it with 18 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and four steals to help lead the charge. Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchell led Indiana in scoring with 22 points each as the Fever put together another all-around effort to improve to 6-10 on the season.\n\nIt seems like Indiana is starting to hit its stride after a rough start to the year - although a tough schedule didn't help. What stood out to Clark, though, was the complete performances that propelled the franchise to three straight wins, all of which came on the home court.\n\n\"It's huge,\" Clark told the NBA TV broadcast after the game. \"When you can stack these wins, that gives everybody confidence. We're a young group, so I think we're starting to see our our potential and what we're able to do. I think Aliyah's been amazing. Kelsey Mitchell's been great. Everybody's been contributing in ways that they need to, and it's been fun.\n\n\"These have been team wins. It hasn't been any individual that's been doing it at all for us. And when we have that balance, I think it's really hard for the other teams to guard us.\"\n\nIt seems like the connection between Clark and Boston, in particular, is starting to find its stride. Over the last three games, the former South Carolina star is averaging 22.6 points after an up-and-down start to the year. As for Clark, the court vision that stood out at Iowa is again showing up at the professional level.\n\nBut for the Fever as a team, they came together in the fourth quarter to fight off a Washington run to eventually get the victory. Indiana stood strong on defense, and clark said that's going to be important the rest of the year to turn things around.\n\n\"I thought we ran our actions well, I thought we got good shots there at the end,\" Clark said of how the Fever closed the game out. \"I thought that we could have been a little more crisp in a few areas. Took care of the ball for the most part, and then came up with some big stops.\n\n\"That's what it's gonna take. It's gonna be on the defensive end. When they went on a run, we found a way to nail it down and get some stops on the defensive end.\"\n\nAfter three straight home games, Indiana will now head back on the road, starting with a Friday matchup against the Atlanta Dream. In fact, the next two contests will be against teams that came to Indiana during the home stand, including another rematch with Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky on Sunday.\n\nAs the Fever hit the road, Caitlin Clark said it's important to avoid looking too far beyond the next game. Keeping the confidence will be paramount, as well.\n\n\"Two teams that we're really familiar with and played last week,\" Clark said of the upcoming road trip. \"So I think just take it one game at a time. You can't look too far ahead in this league. Everybody's really good and these teams that we're gonna play this next week are gonna want some revenge after we beat them this last week. And then, we go on a West Coast swing with three games.\n\n\"Like I said, one game at a time, but we feel like we can go into any game and believe we're gonna win.

The victory was the Fever's third in a row and fifth in their last seven games.\n\nWith the Fever now 6-10 on the season and holding a playoff spot for the moment, Clark touched on the team's improvement in last night's postgame press conference.\n\n\"I think everybody just loves instant satisfaction in our world,\" Clark said. \"No one came in here and said we were going to be WNBA Champions from day 1 in our locker room. That was never our goal. Our goal was to get back to the playoffs and we're fighting for that every single night.\"\n\nLast night's win is Indiana's fourth in their last four tries at home dating back to June 1, an accomplishment that was not lost on Clark.\n\n\"This is the first time we've won four home games in a row since 2015,\" she pointed out. \"You have to have perspective on things, and that goes for life too. Like, have perspective on life. And there just needs to be solid perspective on what this team can accomplish. And I think everybody in our locker room had that.\"\n\nThe Fever got off to a 1-8 start, but six of those losses came against the New York Liberty, Connecticut Sun and Seattle Storm, three of the top four teams in the WNBA's current standings.\n\n\"Nobody ever hung our heads. We had the hardest schedule to start. We didn't get to practice much and we're playing with the most inexperienced team in the WNBA,\" Clark said. \"So, I mean, I think this group is starting to click and build some chemistry and it's one day at a time.\n\n\"But like I said, everybody loves instant satisfaction. Sure, we would have probably loved that too, but I think we all kept a good perspective on knowing we need to get better one step at a time and that's what we're going to continue to do even though we've won three in a row at home here.\"\n\nThe Fever will be back in action on the road Friday night against the 6-7 Atlanta Dream.\n\n[ New York Post ]\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark Shares Her Reaction To Cameron Brink's Crushing Injury News", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_hladik@postandcourier.com", "name": "Matt Hladik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Rowing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift Work", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/27/627cec0e-2a2f-5e59-bacc-d07e85c1a9d2/667487a41da4c.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C82&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 848, "textEnd": 854}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Mitchell -- who sat sandwiched between the franchise's 2022 and 2023 first-overall picks -- is the longest-tenured Fever player, and even she was still playing and attending Ohio State the last time the Fever did this.\n\nWednesday marked another sellout crowd of 17,274 to watch the Fever roll. It was the Fever's third straight win overall, all coming at home over the past week. The Fever never trailed Wednesday, and they tied their third-highest point total of the year. After a 1-8 start, Indiana has won five of its past seven games.\n\n\"These were important games, and I'm proud of us,\" Clark said. \"I felt like we took it one game at a time, we never looked too far ahead.\"\n\nThe Fever are now 4-4 at home after losing their first four games at Gainbridge Fieldhouse this season. The young squad has learned to lean on the large crowds for boosts, especially in tight games.\n\n\"We feel the energy,\" Boston said. \"We use that to our advantage. They're cheering super loud, so we're just thankful that they continue to show up and that they're super loud because we're playing hard for them too.\"\n\nAt least 15,000 fans have come out to watch the Fever in all eight of their home games this year. While those spectators produced groans and quiet moments to begin the year, they've cheered endlessly for the home team as of late.\n\n\"We take pride in our city and the people that represent us,\" Mitchell said. \"So I think it fuels us. It kind of gives us a pick me up or whatever we need as a group.\"\n\nThe trio of Mitchell, Boston and Clark combined for 62 of Indiana's 88 points in the win. They -- along with NaLyssa Smith (11 points) -- have gained comfort alongside each other, and the win column is beginning to reflect that.\n\nNow, the Fever have five straight road games upcoming. When they head to Atlanta to face the Dream on Friday, they'll have a chance for their first four-game winning streak since 2015. The mission now is to travel with this momentum and cohesion.\n\n\"You just got to go one game at a time,\" Clark said of the key to stacking wins. \"And the next two are versus teams that we played in the last week, so they're certainly going to want some revenge. But also, I feel like the confidence that we've been able to build from the last three games is (to) continue to take a step forward and learn each game. And if we do happen to lose one, how are we going to respond? I think that's been a big thing for us too.\"\n\nThe Fever responded to a demoralizing loss at Connecticut on June 10 with three much-needed victories in front of their home fans. If they can stay afloat during their upcoming road trip, this team will have a legitimate chance to make the playoffs for the first time since 2016.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/20/PIND/74153044007-2-jt-09331.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4173,2348,x0,y340&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 2908, "textEnd": 2915}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

There's a reason Indiana earned the No. 1 pick in the WNBA Draft for two consecutive years, and it wasn't because they were winning championships. Hell, they rarely won games.\n\nThe Fever's 1-8 start was somewhat predictable and, if you knew anything about basketball, realistic. Clark, Aliyah Boston, Kelsey Mitchell, and NaLyssa Smith comprise a nice nucleus. But they were also playing the first nine games of their career as teammates.\n\nExpecting them to go out there and beat veteran teams like Connecticut and New York, who have combined to hand Indiana five losses in the first 16 games of the season, was asking girls to go and do a woman's job.\n\nBut Clark and the Fever have shown signs lately of figuring things out. Wednesday night's 88-81 home win over Washington was their third straight victory, one that showed the possibilities this team has with Clark - and some things they can still improve.\n\n\"You're starting to see what this group can do,\" she said after they upped their record to 6-10. \"You can stack wins and it gets everyone confidence. It's been team wins; no individual doing it all for us.\"\n\nThat being said, Clark's fingerprints were all over the latest victory. She stuffed the stat sheet to the tune of 18 points, 12 rebounds, six assists, and four steals. And how she went about it told the tale of how she's learning to play the professional game.\n\nClark torched the Mystics for 30 points on 15 shots in the teams' first meeting on June 7, going 7 of 13 on 3-pointers. They weren't going to let her get off the mark in the rematch. And to her credit, Clark didn't try to force it.\n\nAside from one quickly-launched 3-ball in each half, Clark took what the defense gave her. She scored primarily off drives but attempted just 12 shots. Clark happily played the role of passer, getting Boston going early with a couple of transition feeds for layups that helped her score 22 points.\n\nClark said her rebounding made a difference in the first quarter. She grabbed six boards in the period and Indiana ran hard down the floor.\n\n\"I think we're really good when I can get it off the rim and push in transition,\" Clark said. \"So I take a lot of pride in trying to chase it down off the rim and then really go. I think that led to a lot of easy baskets for Aliyah at the beginning of the game.\"\n\nRelated: WNBA TV ratings: Caitlin Clark vs Angel Reese draws huge numbers, WNBA ratings triple in 2024\n\nNow comes the next test for Clark and Indiana. It's just 2-7 on the road, but has to play the next five on foreign floors. Included on this trip is a much-ballyhooed rematch with Angel Reese and Chicago, plus games with Seattle and two-time WNBA champion Las Vegas.\n\nCan this young team and its young superstar, who's learning on the fly, develop the consistency and toughness it takes to earn road wins?\n\n\"We've all kept perspective, knowing we need to get better one step at a time,\" Clark said.\n\nHubie Brown once said a young team had to learn to crawl before it could walk and learn to walk before it could run.\n\nClark and the Fever have reached walking stage. How quickly she and her teammates get to the running part of the episode might be the most interesting part of the WNBA season.\n\nBucky Dent covers college basketball and the WNBA for Field Level

But even those were not nearly as bad as the ones by WWE wanna-be types Angel Reese and Chennedy Carter in recent weeks.\n\nAnd it was refreshing to see. Finally, just some good, pure basketball for a change with the announcers talking about Clark and not pushing equal-time storylines of other players that frankly are not there in abundance.\n\nANALYSIS: Who Is The Next Greatest Living Ballplayer?\n\nAnd Clark was at her Willie Mays best yet again - as in all-around dominance - in the Indiana Fever's 88-81 win over the Washington Mystics in front of another packed house of 17,274 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.\n\nShe scored 18 points on 6-of-12 shooting with a pair of 3-pointers in six tries, yet also pulled down a pro career-high 12 rebounds, which is amazing for a guard, while dishing six assists with four steals. It was her fourth double-figure scoring game of the last five - a span in which she is also averaging 6.4 rebounds and 5.8 assists. Time and again, she just ran past slower opponents.\n\nShe did have six turnovers and leads the WNBA in that category, but she doesn't play safe. She is a bit like Brett Favre with interceptions. And sometimes her passes are so quick and anticipatory that her teammates don't react fast enough.\n\nBut here's the deal, the Indiana Fever is getting better.\n\nIndiana (6-10) won its third straight game. And it won its fourth straight at home - something not done by the Fever since 2015. Indiana also went to 4-1 since getting four straight days off from June 3-6 after playing an ungodly 11 games in 20 days to start the season, including six games over those last 10 days that featured a pair of back-to-back dates with all four in different cities.\n\nNow amid a more manageable schedule at the moment, Indiana is in eighth place and would have the final playoff spot in the 12-team WNBA. The Fever leads ninth-place Chicago and Angel Reese, who are 4-9. That is significant after an 0-5 start that became 1-8 and 2-9 before the four days off.\n\nDuring those four days off, Clark talked about wanting to just spend some time in her new apartment in Indianapolis.\n\n\"She's a human,\" Clark's seven-year veteran teammate Kelsey Mitchell said at the time. \"And I think she deserves to give herself some grace. And I think a lot of people around the world should, too. She's a 22-year-old kid. Things come with time.\"\n\nAnd it's coming now.\n\n\"Just honestly getting away from basketball a little bit and getting some sleep,\" Clark said during those four days off. \"Taking care of my body and working on my shot.\"\n\nCoach Christie Sides also got to practice her team, as opposed to just the pre-game walk-through.\n\n\"We just had practice. It was great,\" Sides said during the \"vacation\" of four days. \"I felt like we were back in training camp a little bit.\"\n\nAnd it is showing. The Fever is moving the ball around and setting screens for Clark. And other players are shining as well. Particularly Mitchell, who hit a graceful 8 of 11 shots with 4 of 5 from 3-point range on Wednesday for 22 points.\n\nMitchell is just now coming into her game as she missed all of the real training camp with an ankle injury. She is averaging 21 points over her last three games.\n\nClark at point guard and Mitchell at shooting guard - with each able to play the other position just as well - form quite a dangerous tandem, reminiscent of point guard Walt Frazier and shooting guard Earl \"The Pearl\" Monroe on the New York Knicks in the 1970s.\n\nForward Aliyah Boston is also improving. She scored 22 points Wednesday on 8-of-11 shooting and even threw in a 3-pointer along with eight rebounds and a blocked shot. A fourth player - forward NaLyssa Smith - scored in double figures as she added 11 with seven rebounds and a blocked shot.\n\n\"Aliyah was amazing. Kelsey was great,\" Clark said after the game. \"It's been fun. These have been team wins - no individual stars.\"\n\nNow, Indiana goes on the road for five straight, though, as the WNBA seems to schedule without a computer. At least, three of them will be on ESPN.\n\nIndiana next plays at Atlanta on Friday (7:30 p.m., Ion TV) before another nationally televised rematch with Chicago and Reese on Sunday (4 p.m., ESPN).",

You look at Caitlin and you look at the way she passes the ball, and so sometimes things are gonna happen that way and that's okay. We're not going to let her hang her head, we're not going to hang our head over any missed passes.\"\n\n\"We're still continuing to gel together,\" continued Boston. \"And we know that she's a great passer, so if she thinks she can get that ball there, she's going to throw it. And if I miss it, then it's -- we're good. We're alright.\"\n\nBoston put up 22 points against the Mystics while Clark finished with her second career double-double (18 points, 12 rebounds), becoming the first WNBA rookie guard to score multiple double-doubles in a season in 17 years. She currently leads WNBA rookies with 16.3 points and 6.2 assists per game.\n\nBoth Boston and Clark's big nights helped the Fever clinch their fifth win of the last seven games.

Since Catchings left the court, Indiana has had four general managers, including Catchings herself, and four head coaches. That's not conducive to a consistent culture or winning strategy.\n\nLin Dunn's return as general manager in 2022 has provided stability and Christie Sides' first season last year saw an eight-win improvement. Consistency is starting to pay off. The Fever are 5-2 in their past seven games, and their 6-10 record puts them in the eighth playoff spot nearly halfway through the season.\n\n'We feel the energy.' Fever give sellout crowd reason to cheer with 4th-straight home win.\n\nOfficiating Caitlin Clark? Refs weigh in on heated dynamic. 'We're pros. Not perfect'\n\nKelsey Mitchell, who has spent her entire seven-year WNBA career with the Fever, had just won Big Ten Freshman of the Year at Ohio State when the Fever won four consecutive home games. Through the vitriol of the past six seasons, Mitchell has learned what it takes to consistently win.\n\n\"Collectively, it's us taking the time to build the organization to what it can be,\" seventh-year guard Kelsey Mitchell said. \"Tamika Catchings in her era was what it was, and I think we're trying to do something and establish something different.\"\n\nBoth Dunn and Sides worked to overhaul the roster and culture of the Fever, step-by-step. Sides has stressed throughout her year and a half as coach this is a process -- they can't skip steps in the full-scale rebuild, or it will all come crumbling down.\n\nThe Fever went 13-27 in Sides' first year. It wasn't enough to make the playoffs, but it was over double the number of wins compared to the Fever's 5-31 record in 2022.\n\nThen, Indiana got the No. 1 pick for the second straight year. That's when the rebuild started to take off.\n\nAlthough No. 1 pick Caitlin Clark joined the group, the Fever struggled to start the season. Whether it was because of the schedule (11 games in 20 days, five against the WNBA's top teams) or a lack of experience, Indiana started Clark's tenure at 1-8.\n\n\"It was a challenge for them, you know, just everyday,\" Sides said. \"Not having success, going 1-8. That's really hard to do, to keep coming back and just asking them to just stick with it, or let's just keep getting better. Keep getting better, keep improving. And to me, that's, that is what I am the most proud of: they kept showing up. We just keep showing up, we just keep improving.\"\n\nSocial media was filled with calls for Sides' job. There were calls for 2023 No. 1 pick Boston, who struggled to start the season, to be benched or even traded. There were calls for Clark to be traded to a \"better team.\"\n\nBut the Fever blocked out all the noise. They kept working, practicing where they could, and improving.\n\n\"Right now we're keeping the basketball, we're keeping the main thing, the main thing,\" Mitchell said. \"... I don't think we focus on what the world could be saying, and that's the best part for us right now.\"\n\nAnd Clark knew, as the No. 1 pick, she wasn't going to go to a contender. She knew she was going to a struggling franchise, and knew it would take time to build -- even if outside fans didn't.\n\n\"I think everybody just loves instant satisfaction in our world,\" Clark said. \"No one came in here and said we were going to be WNBA champions from day one in our locker room, that was never our goal. Our goal is to get back to the playoffs, and we're fighting for that every single night... you have to have perspective on things, and that goes for life, too.\"\n\nEventually, things started to click. Each of the Fever's core four -- Clark, Boston, Mitchell and NaLyssa Smith -- have scored in double figures for two straight games. Indiana is starting to see through opposing defenses, and the Fever are starting to anticipate Clark's elaborate passes.\n\nIt takes time and reps to build chemistry, and time came at a premium for the Fever in the first three weeks of the season. Now that they have time to slow down, relax and practice, they're starting to see everything come together.\n\n\"I think it's just this group is starting to click and build some chemistry, and it's one day at a time,\" Clark said. \"Like I said, everybody loves instant satisfaction. Sure, we would've probably loved that too. But I think we all kept a good perspective on knowing we just need to get better, one step at a time and that's what we're going to continue to do.\"\n\nFollow IndyStar Fever Insider Chloe Peterson on X at @chloepeterson67.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamika_Catchings", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tamika Catchings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Dunn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Dunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rSCwQBvdOlqZl7nYIUnCfQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/jit/6415665815001/e37148ca-4abc-4e7e-a74c-bc0cc003471d/main/1280x720/1m4s533ms/match/image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

He detailed why in a segment on his show.\n\n\"If you wanna see the 'Caitlin Clark Effect' here it is: Bad team, small market, and they are worth more, the Indiana Fever, than the Los Angeles Sparks, the Dallas, Atlanta, Washington teams, almost equal to a team in Chicago. This is a bad team in a small market.\"\n\nCowherd compared Clark's impact on the league to Tiger Woods' emergence on the PGA Tour. He shared that Woods' breakthrough \"lifted all boats.\"\n\nContrary to some claims, Clark's popularity is because of her play. Her average shot distance on three point attempts is further out than several long range NBA shooters, and she's connecting on long range shots.\n\nClark is popular because her game is entertaining. She's helping resurrect what was one of the WNBA's lowest earning franchises.\n\nThe Indiana Fever guard has changed the game.

Now they play the much-hyped Indiana Fever on the road on a prime-time Friday night slot on NBA TV. Here's the preview:\n\nThe Washington Mystics and the Indiana Fever are among the teams with the very worst record in the WNBA. The Mystics just made a dent in that by stringing together their first two wins of the season. The Fever are so hyped-up that they play in the same big stadium as the Indiana Pacers, and their games are basically sold out. So this won't be a regular away game. Moreover, even though the Fever is playing the lowly Mystics the game will be on national TV, on NBA TV. So expect the players to show up and try to bring that third consecutive win. In the mean time, Edwards is making a name for herself as one of the best rookies in the WNBA. In other news, Sykes returned from injury during that win streak, only to re-injure herself, and is now out for several weeks, complicating things for Washington. Ariel Atkins on the other hand is healthy now, and just dropped 29 (!) on the Chicago Sky on Friday. So things could get interesting. The Fever are 4-10 so a win here for the Mystics would definitely get them closer to that penultimate spot.\n\nThe two teams actually played less than two weeks ago, and the Fever won that game in nail-biter 83-85.

The No. 1 pick added six assists and four steals in 37 minutes.\n\nIndiana has gone 5-2 this month since starting 1-8. Wednesday marked the team's third straight win.\n\nAfter the game, Clark called the start of a winning streak \"huge\" in her on-court interview with NBA TV. She shouted out teammates Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchell, who each scored 22 points on 8-of-11 shooting.\n\n\"When you can stack these wins, that gives everybody confidence,\" Clark said, according to On3's Nick Schultz. \"We're a young group, so I think we're starting to see our potential and what we're able to do. I think Aliyah's been amazing. Kelsey Mitchell's been great. Everybody's been contributing in ways that they need to, and it's been fun.\"\n\nClark added six more turnovers to her league-high total, but she also created some defensive highlights. Right after draining a deep three, the 22-year-old picked Karlie Samuelson's pocket and scored a layup for a five-point swing.\n\nThe Fever endured some early growing pains in a brutal starting schedule featuring multiple meetings with the Connecticut Sun and New York Liberty. However, they've since capitalized on a more manageable itinerary by beating the 2-13 Mystics and 4-9 Chicago Sky two times apiece, with another victory over the 6-7 Atlanta Dream in June.\n\nIndiana begins a five-game road trip when facing Atlanta again on Friday night and Chicago on Sunday afternoon. Clark knows they'll be eager for payback.\n\n\"Just take it one game at a time. You can't look too far ahead in this league,\" she said. \"Everybody's really good, and these teams that we're gonna play this next week are gonna want some revenge.\"\n\nRelated: Caitlin Clark Getting Praised For Classy Gesture After Win Over Mystics", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Schultz_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Schultz (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlie_Samuelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karlie Samuelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/7d/77d9b76d-abfe-5a16-a4e3-706be49a5535/6673966774b05.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Since Catchings left the court, Indiana has had four general managers, including Catchings herself, and four head coaches. That's not conducive to a consistent culture or winning strategy.\n\nLin Dunn's return as general manager in 2022 has provided stability and Christie Sides' first season last year saw an eight-win improvement. Consistency is starting to pay off. The Fever are 5-2 in their past seven games, and their 6-10 record puts them in the eighth playoff spot nearly halfway through the season.\n\n'We feel the energy.' Fever give sellout crowd reason to cheer with 4th-straight home win.\n\nOfficiating Caitlin Clark? Refs weigh in on heated dynamic. 'We're pros. Not perfect'\n\n\"Collectively, it's us taking the time to build the organization to what it can be,\" seventh-year guard Kelsey Mitchell said. \"Tamika Catchings in her era was what it was, and I think we're trying to do something and establish something different.\"\n\nBoth Dunn and Sides worked to overhaul the roster and culture of the Fever, step-by-step. Sides has stressed throughout her year and a half as coach this is a process -- they can't skip steps in the full-scale rebuild, or it will all come crumbling down.\n\nThe Fever went 13-27 in Sides' first year. It wasn't enough to make the playoffs, but it was over double the number of wins compared to the Fever's 5-31 record in 2022.\n\nThen, Indiana got the No. 1 pick for the second straight year. That's when the rebuild started to take off.\n\nAlthough No. 1 pick Caitlin Clark joined the group, the Fever struggled to start the season. Whether it was because of the schedule (11 games in 20 days, five against the WNBA's top teams) or a lack of experience, Indiana started Clark's tenure at 1-8.\n\n\"It was a challenge for them, you know, just everyday,\" Sides said. \"Not having success, going 1-8. That's really hard to do, to keep coming back and just asking them to just stick with it, or let's just keep getting better. Keep getting better, keep improving. And to me, that's, that is what I am the most proud of: they kept showing up. We just keep showing up, we just keep improving.\"\n\nSocial media was filled with calls for Sides' job. There were calls for 2023 No. 1 pick Boston, who struggled to start the season, to be benched or even traded. There were calls for Clark to be traded to a \"better team.\"\n\nBut the Fever blocked out all the noise. They kept working, practicing where they could, and improving.\n\n\"Right now we're keeping the basketball, we're keeping the main thing, the main thing,\" Mitchell said. \"... I don't think we focus on what the world could be saying, and that's the best part for us right now.\"\n\nAnd Clark knew, as the No. 1 pick, she wasn't going to go to a contender. She knew she was going to a struggling franchise, and knew it would take time to build -- even if outside fans didn't.\n\n\"I think everybody just loves instant satisfaction in our world,\" Clark said. \"No one came in here and said we were going to be WNBA champions from day one in our locker room, that was never our goal. Our goal is to get back to the playoffs, and we're fighting for that every single night... you have to have perspective on things, and that goes for life, too.\"\n\nEventually, things started to click. Each of the Fever's core four -- Clark, Boston, Mitchell and NaLyssa Smith -- have scored in double figures for two straight games. Indiana is starting to see through opposing defenses, and the Fever are starting to anticipate Clark's elaborate passes.\n\nIt takes time and reps to build chemistry, and time came at a premium for the Fever in the first three weeks of the season. Now that they have time to slow down, relax and practice, they're starting to see everything come together.\n\n\"I think it's just this group is starting to click and build some chemistry, and it's one day at a time,\" Clark said. \"Like I said, everybody loves instant satisfaction. Sure, we would've probably loved that too. But I think we all kept a good perspective on knowing we just need to get better, one step at a time and that's what we're going to continue to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indiana_fever@indystar.com", "name": "Indiana Fever", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamika_Catchings", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tamika Catchings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Dunn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Dunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight_Edge", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight Edge", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/20/PIND/74153043007-2-jt-09359.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4564,2568,x0,y156&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Rookie posts a double-double as Fever win", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS -- The national narrative was relentless, relatively simple and, as it turns out, totally wrong.\n\nIt went something like this: The Indiana Fever were terrible. Caitlin Clark was struggling. The naysayers were right; the transition for the greatest scorer in major college basketball from Iowa to the WNBA was going to be arduous and ugly.\n\nSo what then should we make of this: The Fever won their fourth consecutive home game for the first time since 2015, when Aliyah Boston was a freshman in high school and Clark was in eighth grade. The team is 5-2 in June, 6-10 overall and would make the playoffs if the season ended today.\n\nClark, the 22-year-old phenom who is the nation's most popular and definitely most discussed athlete -- the one who is bringing crowds and eyeballs to the WNBA as no one ever has before -- has found her comfort zone and is playing beautifully, following her best game Sunday against Chicago with another gem Wednesday night in Indiana's 88-81 victory over lowly Washington before another sellout crowd of 17,274 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nAs for Wednesday night, \"I got off to a fast start there in the first quarter. Sometimes the ball just bounces your way a little bit more and a lot of times the people I'm guarding are getting back in defense so I have a little more free reign of going and chasing down the ball while our bigs are probably boxing out and hitting a little bit more.\"\n\nBy grabbing those rebounds, Clark is able to do what she does best. \"I think we're really good when I can get it off the rim and push in transition,\" she said, \"so I take a lot of pride in trying to chase it down off the rim and then really go. I think that led to a lot of easy baskets for Aliyah at the beginning of the game or just all of us in transition. I think it's a really good thing.\"\n\nThen she smiled. \"But yeah, 12 is...don't get used to it, that's for sure.\"\n\nClark continues to set historic league milestones that no one in league history has reached before her. The latest? She became the fastest player in WNBA history to reach 200 points, 75 rebounds and 75 assists. She did that in her first 15 games.\n\nBut what's best about the high-wire act of Clark's performances are the absolutely electric moments that can change the game in an instant. It happened at Iowa and it's happening in Indiana, and it happened Wednesday night. With the game tied nearing halftime, Clark nailed her first 3-pointer of the night, a dagger from 29 feet. In Washington's subsequent possession, Clark stole an errant Mystics pass and drove to the basket for an easy layup. It was five Clark points in 14 seconds, a lead that Indiana never relinquished.\n\nBut, but, but, some people will say. What about the nation's interest in Clark's turnovers? There were six Wednesday, and when she was asked about them in the post-game press conference, Clark was dutifully remembering them and going through each one when Boston, who scored 22 points, interrupted.\n\n\"You look at Caitlin and you look at the way she passes the ball and so sometimes things are going to happen that way and that's okay because we're not going to let her hang her head, we're not going to hang our head off of any missed passes,\" Boston said. \"We're still continuing to jell together and we know that she's a great passer so she thinks she can get that ball there, she's going to throw it and if I miss it, then we're good, we're alright, we're good.\"\n\nThis was a young team breathing a sigh of relief and taking a deep breath, with a little extra bounce in its step, and why not? Indiana endured a ridiculous murderer's row start of 11 games in 20 days, six of which were against the WNBA's top three teams -- by far the most grueling opening schedule of any team in the league.\n\n\"We didn't get to practice much and we are the most inexperienced team in the WNBA,\" Clark said. \"Now this group is starting to click and build some chemistry. Everybody loves instant satisfaction. Sure, we would have probably loved that too. But we all kept good perspective knowing we need to get better one step at a time.\"\n\nSaid Fever head coach Christie Sides: \"The youngest, least experienced team in the league, that schedule was tough, with no practice time. I keep saying it but just the way these guys keep showing up, I'm so proud of them because now they're feeling what it should have felt like at the beginning for them.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

After two straight victories, Washington fell to the Indiana Fever 88-81 in Indianapolis. The Mystics struggled to get going, but eventually found a rhythm to keep the game close. With seven minutes left in the fourth quarter, Emily Engstler completed a three-point play to pull Washington within three points. But, in a scene that has been all too familiar this season, the defense couldn't get a stop and a Washington turnover on the next possession allowed Indiana to regain control. A couple minutes later, Clark hit a deep three to put the Fever up nine and they wouldn't look back from there.\n\nThe Mystics faced an uphill battle from the tip-off as Shakira Austin and Brittney Sykes were unavailable again. Kelsey Mitchell, Caitlin Clark, and Aliyah Boston capitalized on the absence of Washington's two best defenders. The trio combined for 62 of Indiana's 88 points. Boston dominated the paint and Clark filled up the stat sheet with 18 points, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists. For Washington, Ariel Atkins put up 27 points on 17 shot attempts despite shooting 2-for-8 from three. It was the first time in her career that she has had back-to-back 25 point performances.

I think one was a set design where I just assumed Aliyah was gonna be open and I didn't even look before I threw it,\" Clark said. \"So, I think just slowing down a little bit.\"\n\nClark then tried to remember more of her mistakes, but Boston interrupted the rookie.\n\n\"It's OK. It's alright, it's alright, don't worry,\" Boston said. \"Because, you look at Caitlin and you look at the way she passes the ball and so sometimes things are gonna happen that way. That's OK. We're not gonna let her hang her head, we're not gonna hang our head on any missed passes.\n\n\"We're still continuing to jell together and we know that she's a great passer. So, if she thinks she can get that ball there, she's gonna throw it. And if I miss it, then, we're good. We're alright. No worries.\"\n\nBoston also had an outstanding performance, finishing the game with 22 points and eight rebounds in the win. The Fever have now claimed three straight victories and have won five of their last seven contests, improving to 6-10 on the season.\n\nAfter a bumpy start to the 2024 season, it seems that Clark, Boston and the rest of the team are finally starting to find that chemistry.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6356,h_3575,x_247,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastbreak/01j0v8zx9cngqqt6dv36.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Thanks to Caitlin Clark for bringing on her A game, which helped the franchise secure their third back-to-back win and ended her night with yet another record.\n\nAccording to StatMamba, Clark became the only WNBA rookie guard after former player Sidney Spencer (in 2007) to score more than one double-double in a season.\n\nThough Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchell scored a team-high 22 points each, Clark's outstanding double of 18 points and 12 rebounds, coupled with 6 assists, in the 88-81 against the Washington Mystics stole the show on Wednesday.\n\nThis was the 22-year-old's second time scoring a double-double in the WNBA and her first time was against the Los Angeles Sparks last month. Clark did get a few more opportunities in between to bag the record earlier, but she missed them by an inch.\n\nShe is averaging 16.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 1.3 steals and a block per game. Clark is having an impressive first season like her fellow rookies, though the Sparks forward Cameron Brink has faced a major blow that broke the former Iowa star's heart.\n\nDuring a game against the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday, Brink slipped on the hardwood while running for a bucket and tore her ACL. This unfortunate incident disheartened Caitlin Clark.\n\nCalling Brink's injury \"devastating\", Clark told media, \"You don't want to see anybody deal with any sort of injury, and obviously not one of that magnitude.

Indiana defeated the hapless Washington Mystics on Wednesday to improve to 6-10.\n\nStar rookie Caitlin Clark finished the game with 18 points and six assists. She also recorded four steals, but debates over the game's officiating took center stage.\n\nSome observers took issue with the referees over their decision to not call a foul after a Mystics player appeared to whack Clark as she was driving toward the basket and going for a layup.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nDuring the play in question, Mystics center Stefanie Dolson reached out in an apparent attempt to block the shot. However, Dolson made contact with Clark's arm as the ball was knocked from Clark's hand.\n\nSome fans argued that Dolson committed a foul because Clark's layup attempt was negatively impacted by the contact.\n\n\"As a new watcher of the @WNBA it seems they have a severe refereeing problem. I think even @WWE refs would have caught this one,\" one fan wrote on X.\n\nCAITLIN CLARK RECEIVES ADVICE FROM WORLD SERIES CHAMP AMID RISING FAME, JEALOUSY TOWARD HER\n\n\"Badly missed call by @WNBA officials; this happens too often, to many players,\" another person suggested.\n\nClark being on the receiving end of hard fouls has been widely debated throughout the WNBA season.\n\nLast month, Clark addressed the level of physicality she faced in the early portion of her professional basketball career.\n\n\"I think everybody is physical with me. They get away with things that probably other people don't get away with,\" Clark said on May 28 after the Fever dropped a game to the Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nThe Fever-Sky matchup on June 1 was marred by a controversial foul. Sky guard Chennedy Carter made a basket late in the third quarter. She then shifted to defense and began guarding Clark, who was attempting to get open to receive an inbound pass.\n\nClark never touched the ball as Carter delivered a shoulder check, which knocked the Fever star to the hardwood. Referees immediately called a foul on Carter.\n\n\"Yeah, that's just not a basketball play,\" Clark told ESPN at the end of the third quarter. \"But you know, I've gotta play through it, that's what basketball is about at this level. I thought we've been really physical, we've missed some bunnies around the rim, so hopefully those fall in the fourth.\"\n\nThe next day, the WNBA determined that Carter's foul against Clark was a flagrant-1 violation after reviewing the play.\n\nThis past Saturday, Angel Reese was called for a flagrant foul after she hit Clark in the head during a layup attempt. Reese said the foul was a common part of basketball games.\n\n\"A basketball play. It was a basketball play,\" Reese said. \"I can't control the refs.

(AP) -- The Caitlin Clark era in the WNBA has officially begun, although it got off to a slow start.\n\nClark went scoreless for nearly the first 15 minutes, before getting more comfortable and finishing with 20 points in the Indiana Fever's 92-71 loss to the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday night.\n\nShe knows she'll have to play better and has a lot to work on, but also understands that it's only the first game in her career.\n\n\"It was physical and obviously it wasn't like the best start,\" Clark said. \"It was just a lot of things to learn from.\"\n\nClark said before the game that she wouldn't get too caught up on her play in her first game.\n\n\"If something isn't perfect, my life's not going to end,\" she said. \"If, you know, we lose the game tonight, my life's not going to end. I'm just going to learn from it and come back on Thursday and try to help us win.\"\n\nOne thing that Clark definitely will want to improve on is her turnovers. She had 10 of Indiana's 25 -- many unforced.\n\n\"Some uncharacteristic things, like pick the ball up and travel, dribble it off my foot,\" she said. \"A few things that, you know, you have to be crisper.\"\n\nClark got off to a really slow start as she missed her first four shots before finally getting on the board midway through the second period. The NCAA's all-time Division I scoring leader stole the ball around the foul line and drove the length of the court before laying the ball in. Clark had said before the game that she thought her first basket would come on a layup since it was a \"high-percentage\" shot.\n\nClark later added two free throws and hit a 3-pointer with 29.9 seconds left in the first half to finish the opening 20 minutes with seven points, hitting two of her seven shot attempts.\n\nShe carried some of that momentum into the third quarter when she scored five of her points to try to rally the Fever, but it just wasn't enough.\n\n\"We got to help her out, better job coming back to the ball,\" Fever coach Christie Sides said. \"We worked on that several times this week. We have to do a better job getting someone back to the ball.\"\n\nBefore her first basket, Clark struggled and got into early foul trouble. Her first shot was a drive to the basket that bounced hard off the glass and into Aliyah Boston's hands for a putback. Clark missed a runner in the lane, and then her 3 from the left wing just rimmed out. She did have an assist on one basket and threw a nifty behind-the-back pass to teammate Boston, but last season's Rookie of the Year was called for a traveling violation.\n\nMeanwhile, Clark was called for two fouls on the defensive end. The second one drew loud boos from the sellout crowd. The crowd gave the No. 1 pick in the draft a loud ovation when she was announced in the pregame introduction.\n\nBefore the game, Clark admitted she was eager for her WNBA debut. It was one of four games on the league's opening night to tip-off the WNBA's 28th season. New York, which was runner-up in the WNBA Finals, rallied to beat Washington 85-80 to start the evening.\n\nShe sat around most of the day at the hotel and had to wait to get on the court when her team arrived nearly 2 1/2 hours before tipoff.\n\n\"I just want to get out there and play,\" she said. \"I got plenty of time to sit and think about it. Still this is exciting. This is fun. ... There's just a different buzz in the air.\"\n\nEven before playing a WNBA game, Clark has left her mark in the pros. The league's draft had record viewership, and her No. 22 Indiana Fever jerseys have been flying off the shelves. There were hundreds of fans walking around the arena in Clark jerseys and T-shirts.\n\nThree WNBA teams have already moved their games to bigger arenas to keep up with the demand for tickets to watch her play. Her debut in Connecticut is sold out -- the first sellout for the Sun in a season opener since they played their inaugural game at Mohegan Sun Arena in 2003 after moving from Orlando. There's also a huge media turnout with nearly four times the number of credentials issued for this game than a normal Sun contest.\n\nThis was the second sold-out crowd Clark has played in front of in her extremely young WNBA career. Her preseason game in Dallas was sold out, too. More than 13,000 fans also turned up for her only home preseason game.\n\nClark's home debut will be Thursday, when the Fever host the New York Liberty.\n\n\"Our preseason game was tremendous, doing it for real is going to be a lot of fun; it's going to be loud,\" Clark said. \"Use the environment to our advantage.\"", "source": {"uri": "fox16.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KLRT -

All eyes were once again on Clark, who's had a break from the headlines since Angel Reese of the Chicago Sky flagrantly fouled her.\n\nDuring the sequence, Clark challenged Dolson at the rim. The 6-foot-5 Mystics player tried cutting off Clark, throwing an arm that appeared to clip the Fever player.\n\nClark sounded off on the officials, asking for the foul call after the rough defense by Dolson.\n\nThe scene also begged the question: did the refs swallow an easy call? (What do you think: foul or no foul? Send us your thoughts: alejandro.avila@outkick.com)\n\nWATCH:\n\nIt's worth noting that the Mystics are one of the few WNBA teams not mocking Clark amid her star-making season.\n\nDolson started to get hot from the three-point line in the fourth, challenging Clark's long-range shooting. The Mystics center went 4-of-7 from deep.\n\nAll around, it was a competitive contest, headlined by the famous Caitlin Clark.\n\nIn the first half of the Fever and Mystics game, Indiana maintained a lead throughout but never pulled away from Washington. The Mystics never took a lead in the contest and Indiana won, 88-81, to extend its win streak to four games.

The Indiana Fever guard put up six rebounds in the quarter.\n\nClark isn't known for her rebounding prowess, though she puts up respectable numbers around the backboard. Still, adding six boards in a quarter isn't the norm for several WNBA players, much less the talented guard.\n\nRecent games have shed light on Clark's underrated ability to rebound. The Indiana guard is one of three rookies in WNBA history to have five games with 20 points, five rebounds and five assists.\n\nThe well-rounded play is a huge reason why many view Clark so highly. She's proven to be more than a three-point specialist, but a strong rebounder and facilitator.\n\nThe Fever are continuing to operate at a high level offensively against the Mystics, though against lesser competition. Washington is just 2-12 on the season.\n\nClark's rebounding is only adding opportunities to the Fever's efficient offense. She'll look to continue to record impressive statistical performances as her rookie season progresses.\n\nRelated: Christie Sides Stops Media Availability to Drop Honest Admission on Cameron Brink\n\nRelated: Colin Cowherd Stuns with Compelling Claims on 'Caitlin Clark Effect'\n\nRelated: Christie Sides Drops Honest Admission on Aliyah Boston's Style of Play", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_hickey@postandcourier.com", "name": "Joey Hickey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/80/f80ff803-cd26-53bb-b780-f59a49b90e4c/667383931bf72.image.jpg?crop=1144%2C601%2C0%2C99&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

However, Dolson made contact with Clark's arm as the ball was knocked from Clark's hand.\n\nSome fans argued that Dolson committed a foul because Clark's layup attempt was negatively impacted by the contact.\n\n\"As a new watcher of the @WNBA it seems they have a severe refereeing problem.

They get away with things that probably other people don't get away with,\" Clark said on May 28 after the Fever dropped a game to the Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nThe Fever-Sky matchup on June 1 was marred by a controversial foul. Sky guard Chennedy Carter made a basket late in the third quarter. She then shifted to defense and began guarding Clark, who was attempting to get open to receive an inbound pass.\n\nClark never touched the ball as Carter delivered a shoulder check, which knocked the Fever star to the hardwood. Referees immediately called a foul on Carter.\n\n\"Yeah, that's just not a basketball play,\" Clark told ESPN at the end of the third quarter. \"But you know, I've gotta play through it, that's what basketball is about at this level. I thought we've been really physical, we've missed some bunnies around the rim, so hopefully those fall in the fourth.\"\n\nThe next day, the WNBA determined that Carter's foul against Clark was a flagrant-1 violation after reviewing the play.\n\nThis past Saturday, Angel Reese was called for a flagrant foul after she hit Clark in the head during a layup attempt. Reese said the foul was a common part of basketball games.\n\n\"A basketball play. It was a basketball play,\" Reese said. \"I can't control the refs.

That was an anomaly in multiple regards.\n\nIn her other five games in June, Clark has shot 9 of 34 (26.5%) from deep. Compare that to her early showings where she was not setting the earth afire but did go 24 of 75 (32%) in her first nine games, clearing this prop in five of them.\n\nSecondly, Washington does not generally give up a bevy of open looks from deep. The Mystics rank No. 8 in the WNBA in 3-pointers attempted against per game, and opponents make only 33.6% of them, perfectly middling.\n\nClark exploding two weeks ago was unlike both her of late and Washington all season. Betting against a repeat performance should yield value.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/fad06cd0-609d-4ba6-845d-b5f7a33b991f.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 495, "textEnd": 501}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

I think even @WWE refs would have caught this one,' a third viewer quipped.\n\n'Badly missed call by wnba officials; this happens too often, to many players,' another wrote, while someone else echoed the sentiment, 'Officiating in wnba is terrible, actually it sucks.'\n\nClark and the Fever were hit hard by critics after the team lost its first five games of the season, however the Iowa alum slammed those demanding 'instant satisfaction' from her.\n\n'No one came in here and said we were going to be WNBA Champions from day No 1 in our locker room,' Clark said after the game Wednesday.\n\n'That was never our goal. Our goal was to get back to the playoffs and we're fighting for that every single night. This is the first time we've won four home games in a row since 2015,' she added.\n\n'You have to have perspective on things, and that goes for life too. Like have perspective on life.

We didn't get to practice much and we're playing with the most inexperienced team in the WNBA. So I think this group is starting to click and build some chemistry and it's one day at a time.'\n\nIt's been a tough rookie season for the former college superstar, who's been the victim of particularly rough treatment from other players in the league.\n\nMost recently, her longtime rival Angel Reese committed a flagrant foul against her during the Fever's last meeting with the Chicago Sky.\n\nReese missed a block and smacked Clark on the head while she was jumping for the basket. Although it was an obvious foul, the LSU alum later threw shade at Clark, claiming the Fever received a 'special whistle.'\n\nIt came a couple of weeks after Reese's Sky teammate, Chennedy Carter, hip-checked Clark.\n\nUsing her own bodyweight, Carter knocked the rookie to the ground as she stood waiting for the inbound during the third quarter.\n\nCarter seemingly yelling 'you b***h' at the 22-year-old, however the Chicago player remarkably escaped with just a personal foul.\n\nClark's fierce rivalry with Reese, and her teammates by proxy, has propelled WNBA viewership to never-before-seen heights.\n\nThe Fever's 91-83 victory over the Sky on Sunday was the league's most-watched game in more than two decades.\n\nThe highly-anticipated matchup averaged 2.25 million viewers, a 225% increase over an average game last season.\n\nViewership peaked at 3 million households, making the showdown the most highly-viewed game in 23 years.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanie_Dolson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefanie Dolson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagrant_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flagrant foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal foul (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rewrite-this-title-Caitlin-Clark-at-the-center-of-WNBA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

With the immense pressure a player like Clark brings to the table, Sides' mental health should be a point of emphasis for the Fever.\n\nSides' personal message showed her true emotions. She believes it's vital to have this type of relationship with the team, and she seems extremely appreciative that her players treat her with love and care.\n\nIndiana is getting incredible attention recently.

Fans looking to watch this WNBA game can do so for free by using FuboTV and DirecTV Stream, which both offer a free trial or with SlingTV, which doesn't offer a free trial but has promotional offers available.\n\nThe first contest was won by the Fever, 85-83, to drop Washington to 0-11. The Mystics took one more loss in a five-point game against the Connecticut Sun and have since rattled off consecutive victories to get to 2-12 on the season.\n\nIndiana has looked better since its rough start to the season. While clark has continued to take rookie lumps throughout the season, she's also shown flashes of brilliance, like going 7-for-11 for 23 points with nine assists and eight rebounds in the Fever's last contest, a 91-83 victory over the Chicago Sky. But it is 2023 No. 1 pick Aliyah Boston who recently earned Player of the Week for the Eastern Conference and for the whole league, according to the Associated Press. Boston averaged 20 points, 13 rebounds, 3.7 assists, and two blocks from June 10-16 while the Fever went 2-1 to climb to 5-10.\n\nInjuries continue to be a major factor this season, with the Dallas Wings being one of the team's on the wrong side of injury luck this season.\n\nWings leading scorer Arike Ogunbowale is now sidelined with a sore Achilles, according to the Associated Press. This comes with the squad already missing All-Star Satou Sabally with a shoulder injury and Natasha Howard with a foot problem. Sabally has not played all season and Howard has only played one game.\n\nIn Tuesday's action, 2024 No. 2 pick Cameron Brink went down with what appeared to be a knee issue. she missed the remainder of the Los Angeles Sparks' 79-70 loss to the Connecticut Sun.\n\nBrink had to be carried to the locker room, but reports after the game said she walked out of the stadium on her own power.\n\n\"Except for the 2019 season I've lost a starter to injury every single year I've been a head coach in this league,\" Sparks coach Curt Miller said. \"You just have to have the mentality of next person up and rally around it.\"\n\nOn the other end of the injury spectrum, Las Vegas Aces Olympic point guard Chelsea Gray is finally ready and expected to make her long-awaited season-debut against the Seattle Storm on Wednesday. She's missed the whole season with a left foot injury from last year's WNBA Finals.\n\n\"We're going to see how that goes and evaluate and make an in-game call then,\" Aces coach Becky Hammon said. \"We kind of have a general idea of what we're doing with her, but it can change one way or another depending on how it goes.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.", "source": {"uri":

The spotlight shines on Caitlin Clark, whose prop odds have dominated a list of data-driven WNBA betting edges released early this morning, while trending Washington Mystics star Ariel Atkins is conspicuously absent from the list.\n\nHere's a look at the top prop bets for Wednesday's matchup between Indiana and Washington, based on recent simulations from Dimers.com.\n\nAt the heart of the WNBA prop bets are standout players like Caitlin Clark. Clark, known for her exceptional scoring ability and three-point shooting, has become a central figure in the betting markets with averages of 16.1 points and 2.7 three pointers per game in 2024. Clark's dominance of Dimers.com's recent WNBA prop edge list has raised eyebrows, leading to questions about whether her superstar status is resulting in preferential treatment.\n\nHowever, Greg Butyn, a data analyst at Dimers.com, addressed these concerns, stating, \"All of Dimers' betting edges are calculated with data-driven simulations. This approach ensures that our prop bets are based purely on statistical analysis, eliminating any potential bias towards any player.\"\n\nAriel Atkins, a key player for the Washington Mystics, has been conspicuously absent from the top prop bets despite her impressive performances this season. Atkins has been a consistent force for the Mystics, averaging 14.6 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game. She recently scored 29 points in a tight game against the Chicago Sky and has continued to be a pivotal player for her team.\n\nAtkins, who has signed a multi-year extension with the Mystics, has been a cornerstone for the franchise, setting the team record for career three-pointers and earning back-to-back All-Star appearances. Her exclusion from the top props list has sparked discussions among fans and analysts, who believe she deserves more recognition for her contributions on the court.\n\nThe prop bets for Wednesday's game offer exciting opportunities for fans and bettors. Caitlin Clark's prominence in the props reflects her potential impact on the game, while NaLyssa Smith's consistent performance also stands out. Ariel Atkins' absence from the top props list might come as a surprise to some, but it underscores the depth and competitiveness of the WNBA.\n\nThe Mystics, with a recent boost from their first two wins of the season, are looking to continue their winning streak. Meanwhile, the Fever, playing in a prime-time slot on NBA TV, aim to leverage their home-court advantage at the sold-out Gainbridge Fieldhouse. The last encounter between these teams ended in a close 85-83 victory for the Fever, adding extra intrigue to this rematch.\n\nAs the Mystics and Fever prepare for their high-stakes matchup, these prop bets add another layer of excitement, and can be made with betting bonuses to protect your money. Keep an eye on the latest updates and betting trends to make the most informed wagers. Tune in to NBA TV at 7 pm ET to catch all the action live.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Proposition bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Atkins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ariel Atkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/UXHE45YJORE3VLUQO5VHEPRP7Q.jpg?auth=2765fb3af11aa6101c100c047297abcd9a27170991a455e7d7cb6097d5755906&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660650", "eventUri": "eng-9660650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

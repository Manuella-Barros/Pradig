But that did not mar the enjoyment of fans who declared the event \u201cfantastic\u201d and called for it to be repeated. The two-day event, which continues today at the Black Isle Showground in Muir of Ord, features a line-up of bands headed by Stornoway\u2019s Peat & Diesel comprising Calum \u201cBoydie\u201d MacLeod, Innes Scott and Uilly Macleod. Over the weekend, 10,000 people are set to attend with yesterday\u2019s event being for over 16s while today will be more family-orientated. After the opening day of the festival, Peat & Diesel posted on social media: \u201cWe just want to thank you all for coming last night and making it so special. \u201cTo every band, every person involved, it was an incredible evening.\u201d The post also apologised for the bar and what transpired on a hot day with thousands of thirsty punters, adding measures were being put into place to rectify this. Peat & Diesel\u2019s manager Robert Hicks told Highland News & Media: \u201cWe were overwhelmed. \u201cWe have to put our hands up and say we got it wrong. \u201cIt was a bit of a perfect storm. The weather was hot, people arrived early and it appears we just couldn\u2019t keep up with a thirsty audience. \u201cWe have acknowledged on social media that we got that bit wrong and we have made some changes today. \u201cBut overriding this is that there has been an overwhelmingly positive and fun atmosphere.\u201d Mr Hicks said even those queuing for the bar were glad to be celebrating at the festival. \u201cWe always look at the negatives and see what we have to sort out if we were to do something like this again and make it positive,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have 10,000 on the showground over the weekend especially in a year when lots of events are struggling is incredible testament to Peat & Diesel and the draw and the connection they have with fans.\u201d Peat & Diesel perform again this evening after The Feeling and The Vatersay Boys. Yetserday\u2019s line-up included The View and The Feeling. Highland mental health charity Mikeysline and MFR\u2019s Cash for Kids are the nominated charities for the event. Fans posting their comments online included Angela Clark who said: \u201cThe bar queue was a small thing that didn't spoil an amazing day. It was lovely and sunny and u could still enjoy the music from the queue.\u201d Kelly MacDonald posted: \u201cIt\u2019s the first Black Isle Belter, there was always going to be teething problems. I\u2019m sure the next one will have a better bar set up.\u201d Karen Fraser said: \u201cQueueing for 2 and a half hours for a drink, and over zealous security. Sunshine and music saved the day.\u201d Angela Budge was among those hoping the festival would be repeated. \u201cIt was a fantastic day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all had such fun and everyone looked like they were having the time of their lives. We need this every year please.\u201d Do you want to respond to this article?

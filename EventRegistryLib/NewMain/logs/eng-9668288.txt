Both of them created new accounts and set their ages to 13-years-old for the tests, which mostly took place from January until April this year. Apparently, Instagram served moderately racy videos from the beginning, including those of women dancing sensually or those that focus on their bodies. Accounts that watched those videos and skipped other Reels then started getting recommendations for more explicit videos.\n\nSome of the recommended Reels contained women pantomiming sex acts, others promised to send nudes to users who comment on their accounts. The test users were also reportedly served videos with people flashing their genitalia, and in one instance, the supposed teen user was shown \"video after video about anal sex.\" It took as little as three minutes after the accounts were created to start getting sexual Reels. Within 20 minutes of watching them, their recommended Reels section was dominated by creators producing sexual content.\n\nTo note, The Journal and Edelson conducted the same test for TikTok and Snapchat and found that neither platform recommended sexual videos to the teen accounts they created. The accounts never even saw recommendations for age-inappropriate videos after actively searching for them and following creators that produce them.\n\nThe Journal says that Meta's employees identified similar problems in the past, based on undisclosed documents it saw detailing internal research on harmful experiences on Instagram for young teenagers. Meta's safety staff previously conducted the same test and came up with similar results, the publication reports. Company spokesperson Andy Stone shrugged off the report, however, telling The Journal: \"This was an artificial experiment that doesn't match the reality of how teens use Instagram.\" He added that the company \"established an effort to further reduce the volume of sensitive content teens might see on Instagram, and have meaningfully reduced these numbers in the past few months.\"\n\nBack in January, Meta introduced significant privacy updates related to teen user protection and automatically placed teen users into its most restrictive control settings, which they can't opt out of. The Journals' tests were conducted after those updates rolled out, and it was even able to replicate the results as recently as June. Meta released the updates shortly after The Journal published the results of a previous experiment, wherein it found that Instagram's Reels would serve \"risqu\u00e9 footage of children as well as overtly sexual adult videos\" to test accounts that exclusively followed teen and preteen influencers.", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anal sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preadolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preadolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 29}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/anJhCUmUX2MuozhvTvOjMA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MjY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/a226e510-0de3-11ef-b7f7-6acf4059ed39", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668288", "eventUri": "eng-9668288", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

In the study, the accounts did not like or save these sexual videos, but, unlike the initially suggested content, did watch the Reels in their entirety.\n\nThis seemed to be enough to increase the amount of recommendations for videos involving sexual content and even ramp up to more risqu\u00e9 content.\n\n\"After a few short sessions, Instagram largely stopped recommending the comedy and stunt videos and fed the test accounts a steady stream of videos in which women pantomimed sex acts, graphically described their anatomy or caressed themselves to music with provocative lyrics,\" The Wall Street Journal reported. \"In one clip that Instagram recommended to a test account identified as 13 years old, an adult performer promised to send a picture of her 'chest bags' via direct message to anyone who commented on her video. Another flashed her genitalia at the camera.\"\n\nThis, the newspaper adds, lines up with internal reports and analysis as well. The Wall Street Journal pointed to an analogous test conducted by Meta staff in 2021 which found similar results. Another analysis from the following year revealed \"Instagram shows more pornography, gore, and hate speech to young users than to adults,\" according to the publication.\n\nThis, likely along with political and public pressure, led to Meta's January announcement of a stricter algorithm for minor users. However, The Wall Street Journal's test, which includes results from the months following that pronouncement, brings the effectiveness of such changes into question.\n\nMeta, however, disputed The Wall Street Journal's claims saying the publication's test is not reflective of the actual experience on Instagram.\n\n\"This was an artificial experiment that doesn't match the reality of how teens use Instagram,\" spokesperson Andy Stone told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMeanwhile, the publication also looked at competitors TikTok and Snapchat. The Wall Street Journal reported less explicit content on both platforms when performing similar tests.\n\n\"All three platforms also say that there are differences in what content will be recommended to teens,\" Laura Edelson, a computer science professor at Northeastern University who worked on the test with The Wall Street Journal said, according to the publication. \"But even the adult experience on TikTok appears to have much less explicit content than the teen experience on Reels.\"\n\n\"Despite their systems' similar mechanics, neither TikTok nor Snapchat recommended the sex-heavy video feeds to freshly created teen accounts that Meta did, tests by the Journal and Edelson found,\" The Wall Street Journal reported. \"On TikTok, new test accounts with adult ages that watched racy videos to completion began receiving more of that content. But new teen test accounts that behaved identically virtually never saw such material -- even when a test minor account actively searched for, followed and liked videos of adult sex-content creators.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the ByteDance-owned social media platform attributed this to \"stricter content standards for underage users and a higher tolerance for false positives when restricting recommendations.\"\n\nPetaPixel reached out to Meta for comment but did not receive a response ahead of publication.", "source": {"uri": "petapixel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PetaPixel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_marie_segarra@petapixel.com", "name": "Lisa Marie Segarra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online Media", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Journals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/04/InstagramLogo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668288", "eventUri": "eng-9668288", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Northeastern University computer science professor Laura Edelson also replicated the test results.\n\nThe test accounts did not follow any other accounts or like any posts. To test how quickly Instagram ramped up illicit recommendations, the testers scrolled through Reels watching the sexually-charged videos while skipping others.\n\nThe Journal said it conducted similar tests on Snapchat and TikTok, neither of which recommended sexually graphic content to the test accounts under similar conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, current and former Meta employees told the outlet that internal tests had uncovered problems with inappropriate content being served to underage users as far back as 2021.\n\nIn one internal report from 2022, Meta reportedly found that teen users viewed three times as many posts featuring nudity as adults.\n\nMeta has repeatedly said that it is taking steps to ensure teen users have \"age-appropriate experiences\" on its apps.\n\nThe Journal uncovered the illicit content even Meta rolled out stricter content controls in January meant to prevent teen users from being exposed to inappropriate content.\n\nAs part of those new restrictions, users under age 16 are supposed to be blocked from seeing sexually explicit content in their feeds.\n\nThe damning report marks yet another headache for Meta, which currently faces as sweeping federal lawsuit from dozens of states who allege the company's apps have fueled a youth mental health crisis.\n\nMeta is also being sued by the state of New Mexico in a separate suit alleging the company has failed to protect underage users from sexual predators active on its apps.\n\nAs The Post reported, a filing from that lawsuit revealed that executives from Walmart and Tinder parent Match Group confronted Meta after learning their ads were running next to content that sexualized underage users.\n\nIn January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg issued a stunning apology to the families of victims of online child sex abuse during a high-profile hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"No one should go through the things that your families have suffered,\" Zuckerberg said at the time. \"And this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

Over a period of seven months ending in June, the researchers created new accounts with ages listed as 13 and observed the video recommendations provided by Instagram's Reels feed.\n\nFrom the outset, Reels served a mixture of videos that included moderately racy content, such as women dancing seductively or posing suggestively. When these test accounts skipped other types of clips but fully watched the suggestive ones, the algorithm began recommending increasingly explicit content. The study found that within as little as three minutes, adult-oriented creators appeared in the feeds, and within 20 minutes, the test accounts were dominated by promotions from these creators.\n\nMeta has dismissed these findings, calling the tests \"an artificial experiment that doesn't match the reality of how teens use Instagram,\" according to Meta spokesman Andy Stone. Stone said that the company's ongoing efforts have significantly reduced the exposure of sensitive content to teenagers. \"As part of our long-running work on youth issues, we established an effort to further reduce the volume of sensitive content teens might see on Instagram, and have meaningfully reduced these numbers in the past few months,\" he said.\n\nHowever, internal and external analyses suggest otherwise. A 2022 internal document reviewed by the Journal found that Instagram shows more pornography, gore, and hate speech to young users compared to adults. The document revealed that teenagers reported exposure to bullying, violence, and unwanted nudity at significantly higher rates than older users. Teens encountered three times as many prohibited posts containing nudity, 1.7 times as much violent content, and 4.1 times as much bullying content compared to users over 30, the analysis showed.\n\nThese patterns were echoed in the manual tests run by the Journal and Edelson, which took care not to follow or search for specific content to avoid influencing the algorithm. The new accounts started with a mix of conventional videos such as comedy, cars, and stunts. However, after a few short sessions, the initial wholesome content gave way to a frequent stream of videos with sexual themes, showing women provocatively performing or graphically describing their anatomy.\n\nIn contrast, both teen and adult test accounts on Instagram received sexually suggestive content at similar rates, highlighting a lack of differentiation in content recommendations. In some cases, Instagram even recommended videos marked as \"disturbing\" to teen accounts, which Meta attributed to an error.\n\nMeta officials have been debating how to tackle the problem of age-inappropriate content. In a meeting last year, top safety staffers, including Instagram head Adam Mosseri, discussed reducing the frequency of such content being shown to minors. While a proposal to build an entirely separate recommendation system for teens was suggested, Meta has not pursued it.\n\nRead more at the Wall Street Journal here.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_nolan@breitbart.com", "name": "Lucas Nolan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Mosseri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Mosseri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online Media", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Journals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/a-girl-on-her-smartphone.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668288", "eventUri": "eng-9668288", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Credit: Didem Mente / Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nYoung Instagram users are more easily recommended sexually explicit and harmful videos than the platform lets on, according to a new report.\n\nThe child safety findings are based on two different site experiments conducted by the Wall Street Journal and Northeastern University computer science professor Laura Edelson. Tested over a period of seven months, the publication set up new minor accounts which then scrolled through Instagram's video Reels feed, skipping over \"normal\" content and lingering on more \"racy\" adult videos. After only 20 minutes of scrolling, the accounts were flooded with promotions for \"adult sex-content creators\" and offers of nude photos.\n\nInstagram accounts marked as minors are automatically assigned to the strictest content control limits.\n\nThe journal's tests replicate those conducted by former company safety staff in 2021, which found that the site's universal recommendation system was limiting the effectiveness of child safety measures. Internal documents from 2022 show that Meta knew its algorithm was recommending \"more pornography, gore, and hate speech to young users than to adults,\" the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\n\"This was an artificial experiment that doesn't match the reality of how teens use Instagram,\" Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told the publication. \"As part of our long-running work on youth issues, we established an effort to further reduce the volume of sensitive content teens might see on Instagram, and have meaningfully reduced these numbers in the past few months.\"\n\nSimilar tests were run on video-oriented platforms like TikTok and Snapchat, but they did not yield the same recommendation results.\n\nThe new findings follow up a November report that found Instagram's Reels algorithm was recommending sexually explicit to adult users that were only following child accounts.\n\nA February investigation, also by the Wall Street Journal, unveiled that Meta staffers had warned the company about the continued presence of exploitative parents and adult account holders on Instagram, who were finding ways to profit from images of children online.

Meta itself has been sued multiple times for its alleged role in child exploitation, including a December lawsuit that accused the company of creating a \"marketplace for predators.\" Following the creation of its child safety task force in 2023, Meta launched a series of new safety tools, including anti-harassment controls and the \"strictest\" content control settings currently available.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta competitor X recently overhauled its adult content policy, allowing users to post \"produced and distributed adult nudity or sexual behavior, provided it's properly labeled and not prominently displayed.\" The platform has stated that account holders under the age of 18 will be blocked from seeing such content, as long as its labeled with a content warning.

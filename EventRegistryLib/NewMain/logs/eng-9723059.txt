As early as 2028, the first commercial hydrogen flights in Sweden could be in the air,\" said Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt, Professor at Chalmers.\n\nFor hydrogen aircraft, short and medium-range flights are the closest to being commercialised.\n\nA recently published study from Chalmers shows that hydrogen-powered flights have the potential to meet the needs of 97% of all intra-Nordic flight routes and 58% of the Nordic passenger volume by 2045.\n\nFor this study, the researchers assumed a maximum flight distance of 750 miles and the use of an existing aircraft model adapted for hydrogen power.\n\nThe study, led by doctoral student Christian Svensson in Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt's research group, also showcased a new fuel tank that could hold enough fuel and was insulated enough to hold the super-cold liquid hydrogen.\n\nAt the same time, it was lighter than today's fossil-based fuel tank systems.\n\nHeat exchangers are vital to hydrogen aviation and are key to technological advancements.\n\nTo keep the fuel systems lightweight, the hydrogen needs to be in liquid form. This means that the hydrogen is kept supercool in the aircraft, typically around -250\u00b0C.\n\nTo transfer the heat between the supercool hydrogen and the engine, novel types of heat exchangers are needed.\n\nTo meet this challenge, Chalmers researchers have been working for several years to develop a completely new type of heat exchanger.\n\nThe technology, which is now patent pending by partner GKN Aerospace, takes advantage of hydrogen's low storage temperature to cool engine parts and then uses waste heat from the exhaust gases to preheat the fuel several hundred degrees before it is injected into the combustion chamber.\n\nCarlos Xisto, Associate Professor at the Division of Fluid Mechanics at Chalmers, explained: \"Every degree increase in temperature reduces fuel consumption and increases range. We were able to show that short- and medium-haul aircraft equipped with the new heat exchanger could reduce their fuel consumption by almost 8%.\"\n\nThe work to develop solutions for hydrogen aircraft of the future is taking place on a broad front, with governments, universities and private companies working together.\n\nWhilst the technology is well advanced, the challenges lie in the large investments required and in developing infrastructure, business models, and partnerships to produce, transport, and store hydrogen so that the transition to hydrogen flight is possible.\n\nA total transition is expected to require around 100 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually.\n\nGr\u00f6nstedt said: \"There are industry expectations that 30-40% of global aviation will be powered by hydrogen by 2050.\n\n\"It is likely that for a number of years to come, we will need a mix of aircraft that run on electricity, less environmentally harmful e-jet fuel and hydrogen.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"But every aircraft that can be powered by hydrogen from renewable energy reduces carbon dioxide emissions.\"", "source": {"uri": "innovationnewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This is the first time that a collaboration brings together the entire value chain from primary energy production, hydrogen ground operations, with two airlines on board and across a complete network of airports at the same time.\n\nThis collaboration will provide the partners with a holistic view of the hydrogen-powered aircraft and how it can be integrated into the airport ecosystem. It will not only focus on hydrogen supply and infrastructure, but also on the specific requirements for ground operations at airports. The ultimate goal is to foster and support the growth of the hydrogen aviation ecosystem in Spain.\n\n\"At Airbus, the decarbonisation of aviation is one of our most important goals and the deployment of hydrogen powered commercial aircraft with its ecosystem is one of those key levers. Given Spain's great potential in renewables and low carbon hydrogen production, it is essential that the aviation industry as a whole collaborates to secure a future end-to-end hydrogen supply chain up to the airports,\" said Karine Guenan, Airbus' vice-president ZEROe Ecosystem.\n\n\"The decarbonisation of the air transport sector is a priority for Aena. This collaboration will allow us to gain a broader understanding of how the process of supplying hydrogen to Spanish airports could materialise in the future, in order to establish a roadmap to address the main challenges presented by the introduction of this new energy vector in an airport environment,\" added Ana Salazar, director of sustainability at Aena.\n\nMar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sanz, Director of Quality and Environment at Air Nostrum, explained: \"Our commitment is to be at the side of the developers of new technologies aimed at decarbonising air transport. As a regional airline, we can be relevant in the project because we have the necessary conditions to become the first implementers of hydrogen technology, thanks to the size of our aircraft and the average distance we fly\".\n\nTeresa Parejo, Iberia's Director of Sustainability, added: \"Collaboration between the different actors is necessary to advance in the decarbonisation of the sector. Hydrogen will foreseeably be part of the future of aviation, which will come later and will complement the development of sustainable fuels; to reach that future we must start taking the first steps now\".\n\nAndr\u00e9s Su\u00e1rez Global Strategy & Innovation Lead of Exolum stated: \"At Exolum we are committed to the development and operation of infrastructures that contribute to boosting the energy transition and the decarbonisation of air mobility in all its areas and especially with the deployment of hydrogen as a future energy solution for the sector\".\n\nLuis de Oyarzabal, Repsol\u00b4s senior manager of New Business said: \"Renewable hydrogen is key in our decarbonisation strategy. Not only will we use it in our industrial applications, but we also envision its potential in the field of mobility. To promote this market, we consider it is essential to collaborate with the best partners, joined together in this hub, to get the most potential out of the opportunity we have\".\n\nAirbus launched the \"Hydrogen Hub at Airports'' programme to promote the further expansion of hydrogen infrastructure in aviation. To date, agreements have been signed with partners and airports in 13 countries including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nHydrogen is a high-potential technology with a specific energy-per-unit mass that is three times higher than traditional jet fuel. If generated from renewable energy through electrolysis, hydrogen emits no CO2 emissions, thereby enabling renewable energy to potentially power large aircraft over long distances but without the undesirable by-product of CO2 emissions.\n\nBecause hydrogen has a lower volumetric energy density, the visual appearance of future aircraft will likely change. This is to better accommodate hydrogen storage solutions that will be bulkier than existing jet fuel storage tanks.\n\nHydrogen has been safely used in the aerospace and automobile industries for decades. The aviation industry's challenge now is to take this decarbonised energy carrier and adapt it to commercial aviation's needs.\n\nAircraft manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing two primary uses for hydrogen:\n\nHydrogen propulsion: Hydrogen can be combusted through modified gas-turbine engines or converted into electrical power that complements the gas turbine via fuel cells. The combination of both creates a highly efficient hybrid-electric propulsion chain powered entirely by hydrogen.\n\nSynthetic fuels: Hydrogen can be used to create e-fuels, which are generated exclusively through renewable energy.\n\nIn today's aircraft, wings are where the fuel is stored, and they are in no way large enough to store the hydrogen that would be needed for a long flight. Hydrogen aircraft of the future could have extra-large fuselages, but more likely they will be what's called blended wing, in which the aircraft are shaped like large triangles. This would allow them to store more fuel, but also reduce fuel consumption to make the aircraft aerodynamics even better.\n\nAircraft using hydrogen would emit only water, and initial tests suggest they can be just as fast as traditional planes, carrying more than a hundred passengers per flight over thousands of kilometres.\n\nMost of the world's hydrogen today is produced by reforming methane from natural gas - a fossil fuel - which produces carbon dioxide. Efforts continue to develop green hydrogen by using an electric current from a renewable source to convert water into oxygen and hydrogen and reduce emissions in its production. If that is possible, along with no emissions from the planes themselves, aviation could become a green form of travel.\n\nIf Europe were to fully achieve the environmental benefits of hydrogen-power - for example, for air travel, the production of clean - or green - hydrogen needs to be dramatically scaled up. Clean hydrogen is produced from water using an electric current from a renewable source, rather than from fossil fuels. Today only a tiny fraction of hydrogen used in Europe is categorically \"clean.\"", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As early as 2028, the first commercial hydrogen flights in Sweden could be in the air,\" says Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt, Professor at Chalmers University of Technology, and Director of the competence centre TechForH2* at Chalmers.\n\nThe possibility of hydrogen-powered flight means greater opportunities for fossil-free travel, and the technological advances to make this happen are moving fast. New studies from Chalmers University of Technology, in Sweden, show that almost all air travel within a 750-mile radius (1200 km) could be made with hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2045, and with a novel heat exchanger currently in development, this range could be even further.\n\n\"If everything falls into place, the commercialisation of hydrogen flight can go really fast now. As early as 2028, the first commercial hydrogen flights in Sweden could be in the air,\" says Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt, Professor at Chalmers University of Technology, and Director of the competence centre TechForH2* at Chalmers.\n\nSome of these technological advances can be seen inside the Chalmers wind tunnels, where researchers test airflow conditions in cutting edge facilities. Here, more energy-efficient engines are being developed that pave the way for safe and efficient hydrogen flight for heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nFuture of short-range hydrogen aviation for Nordics\n\nFor hydrogen-powered aviation, short and medium-range flights are the closest to being realised. A recently published study from Chalmers shows that hydrogen-powered flights have the potential to meet the needs of 97 percent of all intra-Nordic flight routes and 58 percent of the Nordic passenger volume by 2045.\n\nFor this study, the researchers assumed a maximum flight distance of 750 miles and the use of an existing aircraft model adapted for hydrogen power. The study, led by doctoral student Christian Svensson in Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt's research group, also showcased a new fuel tank that could hold enough fuel, was insulated enough to hold the super-cold liquid hydrogen and at the same time was lighter than today's fossil-based fuel tank systems.\n\nNovel heat exchangers for better fuel consumption\n\nHeat exchangers are a vital part of hydrogen aviation, and they are a key part of the technological advancements taking place. To keep the fuel systems light weight, the hydrogen needs to be in liquid form. This means that the hydrogen is kept supercool in the aircraft, typically around -250 degrees Celsius. By recovering heat from the hot exhausts of the jet engines, and by cooling the engines in strategic locations they become more efficient. To transfer the heat between the supercool hydrogen and the engine, novel types of heat exchangers are needed.\n\nTo meet this challenge, researchers at Chalmers have been working for several years to develop a completely new type of heat exchanger. The technology, which is now patent pending by partner GKN Aerospace, takes advantage of hydrogen's low storage temperature to cool engine parts, and then uses waste heat from the exhaust gases to preheat the fuel several hundred degrees before it is injected into the combustion chamber.\n\n\"Every degree increase in temperature reduces fuel consumption and increases range. We were able to show that short- and medium-haul aircraft equipped with the new heat exchanger could reduce their fuel consumption by almost eight percent. Considering that an aircraft engine is a mature and well-established technology, it is a very good result from a single component,\" says Carlos Xisto, Associate Professor at the Division of Fluid Mechanics at Chalmers, and one of the authors of the study.\n\nThe researchers also note that with more optimisation, this type of heat exchanger technology in a regular Airbus A320 commercial aircraft could provide an improved range of up to ten percent, or the equivalent of the Gothenburg-Berlin route (approximately 450 miles).\n\nSweden pledges big investments, despite challenges\n\nThe work to develop solutions for hydrogen aviation of the future is taking place on a broad front, with governments, universities and private companies working together. In Sweden, the innovation cluster, Swedish Hydrogen Development Centre (SHDC), brings together key players, including industry leaders and experts from academia. At a recent SHDC seminar, researchers from Chalmers presented their work and several commercial companies testified to major investments in hydrogen flights in the coming years. Whilst the technology is well advanced, the challenges lie rather in the large investments required, and in developing infrastructure, business models and partnerships to be able to produce, transport and store the hydrogen so that the transition to hydrogen flight is possible. A total transition is expected to require around 100 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually.\n\n\"There are industry expectations that 30-40 percent of global aviation will be powered by hydrogen by 2050. It is likely that for a number of years to come, we will need a mix of aircraft that run on electricity, less environmentally harmful e-jet fuel and hydrogen. But every aircraft that can be powered by hydrogen from renewable energy reduces carbon dioxide emissions,\" says Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt.\n\nWithin TechForH2, there are good conditions to take on the hydrogen challenge, and with a budget of SEK 162 million (equivalent USD 15.5 million), the competence centre can contribute to the development of a number of different research areas that link hydrogen and heavy transport.\n\nRead more about the new studies:\n\nMore about the scientific articles\n\nThe article Hydrogen fuel cell aircraft for the Nordic market has been published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy and is written by Christian Svensson, Amir A.M Oliviera and Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt. The researchers are active at Chalmers University of Technology and the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil.\n\nThe research has been funded by the Chalmers-led competence center TechForH2, through grants from the Swedish Energy Agency and the participating partners Volvo, Scania, Siemens Energy, GKN Aerospace, PowerCell, Oxeon, RISE, Stena Rederier AB, Johnsson Matthey, Insplorion, and Chalmers.\n\nThe scientific article Compact heat exchangers for hydrogen-fueled aero engine intercooling and recuperation has been published in the journal Applied Thermal Engineering and is written by Alexandre Capitao Patrao, Isak Jonsson, Carlos Xisto, Anders Lundbladh and Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt. The authors are active at Chalmers University of Technology and at GKN Aerospace Sweden.\n\nThe technology has been developed within the EU project ENABLEH2 and the PATH project, which was funded by Chalmers' Transport Area of Advance. The projects ran between 2018-2022, and then the infrastructure was constructed that was then used to test new engine components and make simulations. At Chalmers' TechForH2 centre, research is underway to further develop the technology.\n\nThe research has also received support from the EU programme Horizon 2020 and the Swedish Research Council.\n\nMore about TechForH2\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nTomas Gr\u00f6nstedt, Professor, Division of Fluid Mechanics, Department of Mechanics and Maritime Sciences, Chalmers

The image was produced by Cranfield University, within the framework of the EU project ENABLE H2.\n\nCredit: Cranfield University\n\nThe possibility of hydrogen-powered flight means greater opportunities for fossil-free travel, and the technological advances to make this happen are moving fast. New studies from Chalmers University of Technology, in Sweden, show that almost all air travel within a 750-mile radius (1200 km) could be made with hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2045, and with a novel heat exchanger currently in development, this range could be even further.\n\n\"If everything falls into place, the commercialisation of hydrogen flight can go really fast now. As early as 2028, the first commercial hydrogen flights in Sweden could be in the air,\" says Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt, Professor at Chalmers University of Technology, and Director of the competence centre TechForH2* at Chalmers.\n\nSome of these technological advances can be seen inside the Chalmers wind tunnels, where researchers test airflow conditions in cutting edge facilities. Here, more energy-efficient engines are being developed that pave the way for safe and efficient hydrogen flight for heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nFor hydrogen-powered aviation, short and medium-range flights are the closest to being realised. A recently published study from Chalmers shows that hydrogen-powered flights have the potential to meet the needs of 97 percent of all intra-Nordic flight routes and 58 percent of the Nordic passenger volume by 2045.\n\nFor this study, the researchers assumed a maximum flight distance of 750 miles and the use of an existing aircraft model adapted for hydrogen power. The study, led by doctoral student Christian Svensson in Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt's research group, also showcased a new fuel tank that could hold enough fuel, was insulated enough to hold the super-cold liquid hydrogen and at the same time was lighter than today's fossil-based fuel tank systems.\n\nHeat exchangers are a vital part of hydrogen aviation, and they are a key part of the technological advancements taking place. To keep the fuel systems light weight, the hydrogen needs to be in liquid form. This means that the hydrogen is kept supercool in the aircraft, typically around -250 degrees Celsius. By recovering heat from the hot exhausts of the jet engines, and by cooling the engines in strategic locations they become more efficient. To transfer the heat between the supercool hydrogen and the engine, novel types of heat exchangers are needed.\n\nTo meet this challenge, researchers at Chalmers have been working for several years to develop a completely new type of heat exchanger. The technology, which is now patent pending by partner GKN Aerospace, takes advantage of hydrogen's low storage temperature to cool engine parts, and then uses waste heat from the exhaust gases to preheat the fuel several hundred degrees before it is injected into the combustion chamber.\n\n\"Every degree increase in temperature reduces fuel consumption and increases range. We were able to show that short- and medium-haul aircraft equipped with the new heat exchanger could reduce their fuel consumption by almost eight percent. Considering that an aircraft engine is a mature and well-established technology, it is a very good result from a single component,\" says Carlos Xisto, Associate Professor at the Division of Fluid Mechanics at Chalmers, and one of the authors of the study.\n\nThe researchers also note that with more optimisation, this type of heat exchanger technology in a regular Airbus A320 commercial aircraft could provide an improved range of up to ten percent, or the equivalent of the Gothenburg-Berlin route (approximately 450 miles).\n\nThe work to develop solutions for hydrogen aviation of the future is taking place on a broad front, with governments, universities and private companies working together. In Sweden, the innovation cluster, Swedish Hydrogen Development Centre (SHDC), brings together key players, including industry leaders and experts from academia. At a recent SHDC seminar, researchers from Chalmers presented their work and several commercial companies testified to major investments in hydrogen flights in the coming years. Whilst the technology is well advanced, the challenges lie rather in the large investments required, and in developing infrastructure, business models and partnerships to be able to produce, transport and store the hydrogen so that the transition to hydrogen flight is possible. A total transition is expected to require around 100 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually.\n\n\"There are industry expectations that 30-40 percent of global aviation will be powered by hydrogen by 2050.

As early as 2028, the first commercial hydrogen flights in Sweden could be in the air,\" said Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt, professor at Chalmers.\n\nFor hydrogen-powered aviation, short- and medium-range flights are the closest to being realised.\n\nA recent study from Chalmers shows that hydrogen-powered flights have the potential to meet the needs of 97% of all intra-Nordic flight routes and 58% of the Nordic passenger volume by 2045.\n\nThe researchers assumed a maximum flight distance of 750 miles and the use of an existing aircraft model adapted for hydrogen power. The study also showcased a new fuel tank that could hold enough fuel, was insulated enough to hold the super-cold liquid hydrogen, and at the same time was lighter than today's fossil fuel tank systems.\n\nTo keep the fuel system lightweight, the hydrogen needs to be in liquid form. This means it is kept supercool in the aircraft, typically around -250\u00b0C. By recovering heat from the hot exhausts of the jet engines, and by cooling the engines in strategic locations, the fuel system becomes more efficient.\n\nThe team believes that heat exchangers are \"a vital part\" of hydrogen aviation, transferring heat between the supercool hydrogen and the engine. Researchers at Chalmers have been working for several years to develop a completely new type of heat exchanger. The technology takes advantage of hydrogen's low storage temperature to cool engine parts, then uses waste heat from the exhaust gases to preheat the fuel several hundred degrees before it is injected into the combustion chamber.\n\n\"Every degree increase in temperature reduces fuel consumption and increases range,\" said associate professor Carlos Xisto, one of the authors of the study. \"We were able to show that short- and medium-haul aircraft equipped with the new heat exchanger could reduce their fuel consumption by almost 8%. Considering that an aircraft engine is a mature and well-established technology, it is a very good result from a single component.\"\n\nThe researchers also note that, with more optimisation, this type of heat exchanger technology in a regular Airbus A320 commercial aircraft could provide an improved range of up to 10%.\n\n\"There are industry expectations that 30-40% of global aviation will be powered by hydrogen by 2050,\" said Gr\u00f6nstedt. \"It is likely that for a number of years to come, we will need a mix of aircraft that run on electricity, less environmentally harmful e-jet fuel and hydrogen.

A recently published study from Chalmers shows that hydrogen-powered flights have the potential to meet the needs of 97 percent of all intra-Nordic flight routes and 58 percent of the Nordic passenger volume by 2045.\n\nFor this study, the researchers assumed a maximum flight distance of 750 miles and the use of an existing aircraft model adapted for hydrogen power. The study, led by doctoral student Christian Svensson in Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt's research group, also showcased a new fuel tank that could hold enough fuel, was insulated enough to hold the super-cold liquid hydrogen and at the same time was lighter than today's fossil-based fuel tank systems.\n\nHeat exchangers are a vital part of hydrogen aviation, and they are a key part of the technological advancements taking place. To keep the fuel systems light weight, the hydrogen needs to be in liquid form. This means that the hydrogen is kept supercool in the aircraft, typically around -250 degrees Celsius. By recovering heat from the hot exhausts of the jet engines, and by cooling the engines in strategic locations they become more efficient. To transfer the heat between the supercool hydrogen and the engine, novel types of heat exchangers are needed.\n\nTo meet this challenge, researchers at Chalmers have been working for several years to develop a completely new type of heat exchanger. The technology, which is now patent pending by partner GKN Aerospace, takes advantage of hydrogen's low storage temperature to cool engine parts, and then uses waste heat from the exhaust gases to preheat the fuel several hundred degrees before it is injected into the combustion chamber.\n\n\"Every degree increase in temperature reduces fuel consumption and increases range. We were able to show that short- and medium-haul aircraft equipped with the new heat exchanger could reduce their fuel consumption by almost eight percent. Considering that an aircraft engine is a mature and well-established technology, it is a very good result from a single component,\" says Carlos Xisto, Associate Professor at the Division of Fluid Mechanics at Chalmers, and one of the authors of the study.\n\nThe researchers also note that with more optimisation, this type of heat exchanger technology in a regular Airbus A320 commercial aircraft could provide an improved range of up to ten percent, or the equivalent of the Gothenburg-Berlin route (approximately 450 miles).\n\nThe work to develop solutions for hydrogen aviation of the future is taking place on a broad front, with governments, universities and private companies working together. In Sweden, the innovation cluster, Swedish Hydrogen Development Centre (SHDC), brings together key players, including industry leaders and experts from academia. At a recent SHDC seminar, researchers from Chalmers presented their work and several commercial companies testified to major investments in hydrogen flights in the coming years. Whilst the technology is well advanced, the challenges lie rather in the large investments required, and in developing infrastructure, business models and partnerships to be able to produce, transport and store the hydrogen so that the transition to hydrogen flight is possible. A total transition is expected to require around 100 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually.\n\n\"There are industry expectations that 30-40 percent of global aviation will be powered by hydrogen by 2050. It is likely that for a number of years to come, we will need a mix of aircraft that run on electricity, less environmentally harmful e-jet fuel and hydrogen. But every aircraft that can be powered by hydrogen from renewable energy reduces carbon dioxide emissions,\" says Tomas Gr\u00f6nstedt.\n\nWithin TechForH2, there are good conditions to take on the hydrogen challenge, and with a budget of SEK 162 million (equivalent USD 15.5 million), the competence centre can contribute to the development of a number of different research areas that link hydrogen and heavy transport.\n\nIn the lab.

Hydrogen has long been recognized as a possible low-carbon transportation fuel. Blue hydrogen is primarily produced from natural gas using a process known as steam reforming, which combines natural gas and heated water to form steam. The result is hydrogen, with carbon dioxide as a by-product. As a result, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is critical for capturing and storing carbon, thus leaving clean hydrogen.\n\nThe blue hydrogen market has a promising growth potential due to several factors, including the role of blue hydrogen in carbon emission reduction, an increase in the demand for fuel cell-based electric vehicles, and a shift toward a hydrogen-based economy.\n\nDownload PDF Brochure: www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdown...=217899255\n\nRising focus on achieving net zero emission target by 2050\n\nUnder the scenario of net zero emissions, hydrogen production experiences an unprecedented revolution. In 2030, when the world's output of H2 hits 200 Mt, low-carbon technologies will produce 70% of it. The production of hydrogen will have increased to 500 Mt H2 by 2050, largely because of low-carbon technologies. To attain net zero emissions by 2050, the energy system will need to be modified using several technologies. The main pillars for decarbonizing the global energy system are projected to be energy efficiency, behavioral modification, electricity, renewable energy, Carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), and hydrogen.\n\nIn the net zero emissions scenario, strong hydrogen demand growth and the adoption of cleaner technologies for its production will allow hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels to preclude up to 60 Gt of CO2 emissions in 2021-2050, or 6.5% of all cumulative emissions reductions. Hydrogen fuel is crucial for reducing greenhouse emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries, including heavy industries (especially steel and chemical), heavy-duty road transport, shipping, and aviation, where direct electrification is challenging.\n\nRequest Sample Pages: www.marketsandmarkets.com/request...=217899255\n\nNorth America is expected to be the largest region in the Blue Hydrogen Industry\n\nThe North American region is estimated to be the largest market for the blue hydrogen market, followed by Europe. The growth of the North American region can be attributed to the increasing demand for hydrogen fuel cell-based vehicles and the number of hydrogen filling stations in the US and Canada.\n\nThe European region is projected to be the fastest-growing market during the forecast period. The growth of the European blue hydrogen market is expected to be driven by the increasing demand for fuel cell-based electric vehicles and a shift toward a hydrogen-based economy.\n\nKey Market Players:\n\nMajor players operating in the Blue Hydrogen Market include Shell Plc (UK), Linde plc (Ireland), ExxonMobil Corporation (US), Air Liquide (France), and Air Products Inc.

The goal -- encourage collaboration, discourse and understanding within renewable hydrogen and low-emission iron and steel sectors.\n\nA total of $59.1 million in funding is slated for the projects, part of the Australian Government and ARENA's broader goal to support research and development activities covering these sectors.\n\nTanya Hodgson, Manager for Business, Development and Transactions at ARENA, said of the roundtable that is \"We want to maximise visibility of work happening in the space and create an ongoing expert forum to connect researchers, share learnings and discuss challenges.\"\n\nAustralia faces several hurdles on the path to net zero. A challenge to overcome is scaling the renewable energy sector so there's enough clean energy to replace fossil fuel. This means new, cost-effective, renewable energy technologies need to be implemented on a national scale for widespread adoption and implementation to meet the growing energy needs of the nation and more importantly reducing emissions.\n\nIt's a supply and demand issue at its core.\n\nAustralian experts contend clean renewable energy must be readily accessible, cheap to produce and abundant if the country wants to meet its emission targets.\n\nIn the case of renewable hydrogen, it will prove pivotal as a clean, reliable alternative for industries that won't be served by electrification and typically use emission intensive fuels but there are many obstacles to overcome as it's expensive to produce and transport. These difficulties are halting its widespread adoption and use in various sectors from transport to iron and steel.\n\nIn the iron and steel sector, the production of iron from iron ore requires massive amounts of heat energy. This energy is produced through the burning of fossil fuels. It's a perfect example of a sector that would be well served by renewable hydrogen, but it too faces hurdles. Because these two sectors play so closely together, recipients of funding for greener iron and steel solution were included in the roundtable event. The key was to foster collaboration and understanding on moving forward on the road to net zero.\n\nAll funding recipients were tasked with producing research to answer the complex questions facing renewable hydrogen and low emissions iron and steel process. The hope is to develop more efficient and cost-effective technologies with a pathway to operate on a commercial scale. The knock-on effect would translate to a reduction of emissions in high-emission sectors, like iron and steel. The journey could lead to groundbreaking research and development and would be a massive boon on an economic scale, as our global partners could use the new technologies for liquid hydrogen exports, as well as iron and steel. It would also allow for a local, sustainable hydrogen energy ecosystem to be used in high emission industries, where fossil fuels could be replaced by hydrogen.\n\nRenewable hydrogen industry \"could create jobs and replace economic activity provided by Australia's world-leading exports of coal and gas, as the demand for fossil fuels decline,\" and green steel technologies could \"stimulate job creation through investments in renewable energy, innovation and sustainable practices, fostering economic growth and prosperity,\" Justin Punch, Chair/Non-Executive Member of ARENA said.\n\nEric May, the Managing Director of Future Energy Exports (FEE), gave details on his company's proposed research and their work with ARENA.\n\nMay says one of the ways to transport hydrogen is to convert it to liquid hydrogen and \"the energy stored in hydrogen, uses about a third of that to produce liquid hydrogen,\" making it \"very expensive\". \"We think you can reduce that by a factor of two.\" If FEE 's research can produce results, it will be a great step forward in making hydrogen energy more viable in the coming years, ultimately feeding into ARENA's core mission to reduce emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050.\n\nARENA has been tirelessly working since 2012 to commericalise renewable energy technologies. This is the second renewable hydrogen focused round and we know more work needs to be done.\n\nZoe von Batenburg, ARENA'S Chief Investment Officer, said that \"primary research,\" is key for finding technical and economic solutions needed for a sustainable and renewable energy future.\n\nVon Batenburg went on to say that ARENA's approach shows the path to net zero \"really starts with investment, innovative research and development, working with some of the best minds in Australia.\"", "source": {"uri": "arena.gov.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Renewable Energy Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Renewable_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Renewable Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://arena.gov.au/assets/2024/07/RD-Round-Launch-Andrew-Williamson-Lisa-Randone-1024x683.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723059", "eventUri": "eng-9723059", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

They showcased their hydrogen centre of excellence, dedicated to heavy goods vehicles. The centre, which is due to officially open next September, marks a turning point in the history of decarbonisation and the achievement of carbon neutrality for transport.\n\nFollowing initial announcements that the first vehicles retrofitted by Hyliko had passed the approval process, and the handover of the keys to these first vehicles, the young start-up is continuing at the leading edge with the presentation of the very first centre of excellence for hydrogen-powered HGVs in France, in Villab\u00e9 (Essonne, France), 30 km south of Paris (along the A6 motorway).\n\nThe site brings together:\n\nThis way, HGVs that come to this public station will be able to fill up in almost 20 minutes, with green hydrogen currently produced by Lhyfe, France's leading supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. The first hydrogen vehicles retrofitted by Hyliko are already being used on the road by Point P's haulage operators, the Berto Group and Labatut LVI, as well as by Bert&You and Toyota.\n\nLhyfe produces green and renewable hydrogen through the electrolysis of water, at production units powered by renewable energy. Launched in 2017, the company inaugurated its first site in 2021, and today has four installed sites and several sites under construction across Europe.\n\nMatthieu Guesn\u00e9, Founder and CEO of Lhyfe said: \"Heavy mobility, and road transport in particular, is one of the key sectors for decarbonisation. The HGV fuel chain, which has been developing for several months, is now ready and complete - we're proud to be part of France's first centre of excellence for hydrogen trucks. Haulage operators need hydrogen vehicles, green hydrogen, refuelling stations and maintenance centres to service them. This complete chain has just been inaugurated in the Paris region, and it's a major step forward for hydrogen mobility.\"\n\nLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition, and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.\n\nIts production sites and portfolio of projects seek to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities, and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.\n\nIn 2021, Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm. In 2022, it inaugurated the first offshore green hydrogen production pilot platform in the world.\n\nIn 2023, it inaugurated two new sites, and currently has several sites under construction or expansion across Europe.\n\nLhyfe is represented in 12 European countries and had 195 staff at the end of December 2023. The company is listed on the Euronext market in Paris (ISIN: FR0014009YQ1 - LHYFE).

One of the latest such developments was the strong Q2 delivery data provided by Hydrogen-powered truck maker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). In Q2, the company delivered 72 such trucks, well above its previous guidance of 60. Moreover, one of its customers was Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) Canada unit. That indicates that the world's largest retailer is interested in participating in the Hydrogen Revolution.\n\nMeanwhile, in Australia, Climate Impact Corporation intends to develop a huge 20 gigawatts of green hydrogen initiatives. The firm plans to partner with GE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) for the projects. Here are three top hydrogen fuel stocks that can soar as the demand for green hydrogen surges.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG)\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) continues to lay the groundwork to become a leader of the Hydrogen Revolution. The company is reporting huge losses. However, in the coming years, it plans to build several new green hydrogen plants. Given the large, growing demand for green hydrogen, and the tax credits for the fuel in the U.S., the company's fuel business will likely become very profitable in the long-term. Indeed, Plug has said that it plans to generate \"growing positive fuel margins in 2025 and beyond.\"\n\nSimilarly, deployments of the company's electrolyzers are rapidly ramping up. As a result, I believe that this business will generate huge profits over the long-term as its revenue surges and its costs drop. Electrolyzers are used to produce green hydrogen.\n\nShowing how rapidly the business is growing, Plug reported that it plans to \"ship and begin commissioning\" at least 37 electrolyzers in 2024. These units will produce 40 metric tons of green hydrogen per day.\n\nMoreover, Plug is likely to benefit from Nikola's success, since the two firms announced a partnership in December 2022. With Plug becoming a leader in the green hydrogen boom, I believe that it is one of the best hydrogen fuel stocks to buy.\n\nAir Products (APD)\n\nAir Products (NYSE:APD) provides gases for industrial companies, and looks poised to benefit tremendously from strong demand for green hydrogen. Last month, Air Products disclosed that it had signed a 15-year deal to provide 70,000 tons of green hydrogen to TotalEnergies in Europe. The deliveries are slated to begin in 2030.\n\nAlso last month, the firm announced that it would \"build a network of hydrogen refueling stations running the length of California.\" As a result, the company looks poised to become a leader in the operation of such stations. Given the likely strong demand for hydrogen in the U.S., these stations are likely to eventually become very profitable.\n\nThe company plans to build a $4 billion green hydrogen plant in Texas. However, APD has decided to wait for the IRS to issue the final rules on America's hydrogen tax credits before making its final investment decision. But, since the company said that the initial rules reduced by the agency were acceptable, it is likely to proceed. The facility will give the company another way to benefit from the strong demand for green hydrogen.\n\nGiven the many ways in which Air Products looks poised to benefit from the Hydrogen Revolution, I view it as one of the top hydrogen fuel stocks.\n\nAir Liquide (AIQUY)\n\nGas producer Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:AIQUY) is slated to become a major supplier for Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM). XOM plans to build a hydrogen plant in Texas which will also produce ammonia. Air Liquide intends to supply 9,000 metric tons per day of oxygen and up to 6,500 metric tons per day of nitrogen to the facility. According to Exxon, the plant will become the world's largest producer of hydrogen. It is slated to produce 1 billion cubic feet per day of hydrogen.\n\nInterestingly, Air Liquide also looks poised to benefit from the AI Revolution. That's because it's building a $250 million plant in Idaho to provide Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and other chip makers with gases. The facility is supposed to start producing gas at the end of next year.\n\nKeep an eye on AIQUY since it is dipping its toes into two different, yet lucrative, markets.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in PLUG,GEV, and MU.

Joby CEO and founder JoeBen Bevirt says it represents the first forward flight of a liquid-hydrogen-powered eVTOL, as well as a breakthrough for a technology that holds promise as a sustainable aviation workhorse.\n\n\"It's the seminal moment for aviation, and really shows the incredible capabilities that hydrogen electric propulsion can bring to aviation, not just eVTOL aircraft, but all kinds of aircraft,\" Bevirt says.\n\nJoby's core product is a battery-electric eVTOL that can carry four passengers plus a pilot at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. The aircraft Joby used for its recent test flight consisted of \"90 percent of the systems and components\" of the company's existing eVTOL aircraft, Bevirt says, augmented with a hydrogen-electric propulsion system, which consists of a liquid hydrogen tank and hydrogen fuel cell. When liquid hydrogen enters the fuel cell, it is combined with compressed air to create electricity, water, and heat. That electricity is used to power the vehicle's six motors and propellers, as well as recharge the eVTOL's batteries. The only byproduct is water.\n\nAlthough hydrogen as an aviation fuel source is still not commercially available, it has been used to power flights before. Major players in the hydrogen space, including ZeroAvia and the now-defunct Universal Hydrogen, completed test flights in 2023 and 2024, using gaseous hydrogen, according to Canary Media. Stuttgart, Germany-based H2Fly, which Joby acquired in 2021, says it conducted the first ever piloted, conventional test flight, powered by liquid hydrogen in 2023. H2Fly was instrumental in collaborating on the recent testflight that Joby says was the first to successfully test liquid hydrogen to power an eVTOL. An eVTOL can operate more like a helicopter or even a drone than a commercial fixed-wing plane.\n\nJoby aspires for its eVTOL vehicles to quietly and sustainably ferry passengers within a metropolitan area for relatively short hops. The company is targeting 2025 for the commercial launch of its battery-electric air taxis. Although liquid hydrogen has a longer runway to commercial application, Bevirt says it opens the door to connecting entire regions.\n\n\"Trips that might take you half a day or a day on the ground or by going to an airport and flying, and then driving from your airport to your destination--you can do that half-day or one-day trip and turn it into an hour or two,\" Bevirt says.\n\nHydrogen has appeal as a sustainable fuel source for a variety of reasons. Liquid hydrogen is lighter than both conventional jet fuel and batteries. It contains about three times the specific energy--or energy per unit mass--as jet fuel. It can be burned like oil and gas, but the only byproduct is water, according to MIT, although this is not the approach that Joby is taking. But its low density means that hydrogen takes up a lot of space, which can lead to reduced range in aircraft, according to the Hydrogen Science Coalition. It is also energy-intensive to produce, which can contribute to emissions if the energy used in manufacturing does not come from renewable energy sources and instead comes from coal or natural gas power, for example.\n\nSecuring adequate and reliable \"green\" hydrogen--or hydrogen produced by renewable energy--was one stumbling block to Universal Hydrogen's success, according to The Seattle Times. But Bevirt says he feels optimistic about government support for hydrogen and green hydrogen supply and distribution, including $7 billion, allocated by the U.S. Department of Energy through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to establish nationwide green hydrogen hubs.\n\n\"The world is shifting to a hydrogen economy and aviation is one of the most important use cases for that green hydrogen supply,\" he says.\n\nAviation has earned a reputation for being difficult to clean up. It is responsible for an estimated two percent of global CO2 emissions, but the growth of its emissions has outpaced other transportation sectors and is expected to continue with increased air travel, according to the International Energy Agency and World Economic Forum.\n\n\"Today, aviation is our fastest, lowest cost and safest mode of transport,\" Bevirt says. \"The advantages that aviation provides are just spectacular, but it does more harm to the planet than any other mode of transport. What we have is the technology to take and zero out the emissions of one of the hardest to abate sectors out there.\"", "source": {"uri": "inc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inc.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chloe_aiello@inc.com", "name": "Chloe Aiello", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVTOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EVTOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_taxi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air taxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joby_Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joby Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroAvia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ZeroAvia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propeller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compressed air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 58}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/w_1024,h_576,c_fill/images/panoramic/joby-hydrogen_542662_uk1bcz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723059", "eventUri": "eng-9723059", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-24", "textStart": 235, "textEnd": 242}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

SHAIPS will allow the producer to set a limit on the carbon intensity of hydrogen production, meaning the hydrogen can qualify for the most generous subsidies in their geography.\n\nWith ZeroAvia's approach, excess renewable electricity can be stored as hydrogen, in batteries, or sold back to the grid. The system will also draw capacity from the grid for H2 production at periods of low carbon intensity energy and low cost, with the microgrid solar energy preserved in battery storage for use when most economically and environmentally sound.\n\nVal Miftakhov, Founder and CEO, ZeroAvia said, \"Tomorrow's aviation fuel can be made from water and sunlight with today's technology, the only question is cost. Our advanced software team has delivered an impactful application that can provide end users in aviation, transport and other industries the clean hydrogen fuel they need to operate, at costs that work for all parties. It is inevitable that the levelized cost of hydrogen will fall over time, but we are seeking to accelerate that transition through innovation.\"\n\nSHAIPS was developed by a seasoned team that was previously involved in creating Juice.net, a leading smart-grid charging station network control and management system which featured advanced algorithms for electric grid load balancing and could manage Demand/Response requests from grid infrastructure.\n\nJuice.net ensured smooth operation and enabled trading in the US wholesale electricity market. The JuiceBox charging system, along with the Juice.net software, has been recognized with several awards: the Global Cleantech 100 Award in 2018, the Silver Edison Award in Energy, Sustainability, and Vehicle Improvement in 2018, and the Grid Edge Awards in 2017.\n\nWith a 2025 target for entry in service of its fuel cell powertrains, the company is also pressing ahead to develop the hydrogen fuel ecosystem necessary to support aviation. This began with the demonstration of its world-first Hydrogen Airport Refueling Ecosystem (HARE), now deployed at two separate airport locations. The current HARE system is composed of electrolytic production, mobile storage and distribution and also a fixed pipeline for moving hydrogen from landside to airside.", "source": {"uri": "renewableenergymagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Renewable Energy Magazine, at the heart of clean energy journalism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microgrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_storage_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battery storage power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroAvia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ZeroAvia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emission intensity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Edison"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/agenda/ampliada/v/val.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723059", "eventUri": "eng-9723059", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Specifically, the slab produced is 3.2 metres long, 1.6 metres wide and 12 mm thick, and stands out for its four dimensions - thus the name 4D Ceramics - in which, in addition to the three-dimensionality of the material and its grains, crossing the whole thickness of the slab, we find the fourth dimension: sustainability.\n\nThe production site is the H2 Factory, the new plant in Castellarano, Reggio Emilia - completed in 2023 - and already equipped with the innovative technologies and infrastructures needed to use 100% green hydrogen.\n\nThe industrial process being developed in Castellarano is the first concrete result in the process of decarbonising the ceramics industry that Iris Ceramica Group and Edison Next are working on jointly. After this initial phase, the H2 Factory will be powered by higher percentages of green hydrogen produced in a cutting-edge, bespoke plant already designed and being implemented by Edison Next.\n\n\"The start of this phase is a concrete step towards net zero for a particularly energy-intensive industrial sector like ceramics. This is the proof that, by putting technologies and innovation into play alongside skill and determination, we can achieve major results even in fields where this challenge is tough, as it demands the rethinking of the whole production process and the use of more forward-looking technologies like hydrogen,\" Giovanni Brianza, CEO of Edison Next, states. \"We are proud to be working with one of the top names in Italian manufacturing on this pioneering initiative, not only for the whole sector but also for the country, supporting a new industrial culture that focuses on sustainability. This is not only an opportunity for positive change but also a tool for increasing competitiveness in the reference markets.\"\n\n\"Today marks a major achievement, yet another tangible fact that bears witness to our commitment to decarbonising the ceramics sector. A unique and pioneering project with world-wide scope that offers new prospects for hard-to-abate manufacturing, showing that it can be done,\" Federica Minozzi, CEO of Iris Ceramica Group, explains. \"The test phase will help us to fine tune the production process, before moving on to the next phase, which will allow us to increase the percentage of green hydrogen more and more, up to 50% with the bespoke production system that Edison Next is creating for us. This is a highly valuable partnership, and we are proud of this achievement, the result of team work within the whole supply chain and a virtuous example of integrated sustainability. We hope that other companies will follow our path, so that we can work as a system and become a driver of change, both nationally and beyond,\" Federica Minozzi concludes.\n\nSeveral preparatory activities have been completed in order to launch this first phase: the civil works to prepare the area, the installation of the blending unit, which is the system that mixes the natural gas with the green hydrogen, and all the connections required between the different equipment. Furthermore, a 1.3 MWp (1) photovoltaic system has been installed, in addition to the existing 2.5 MWp plant.\n\nIn particular, the H2 pilot production plant, in operation since May 2024 for the test phase, includes two temporary electrolysers with a total power of 120 KW, powered by renewable energy. The two electrolysers, installed in a container, can produce up to 20 cubic metres of green hydrogen per hour, powering the new, latest-generation \"hydrogen ready\" kiln with a blend of green hydrogen up to around 7%; this percentage will increase once the final plant is installed.\n\nThe aim of this first phase is to study the use of the technology for the production of ceramic slabs using green hydrogen and, at the same time, verify the behaviour of the material during the firing phase, in order to be able to industrialise the production with green hydrogen with the certainty of assuring the technical and aesthetic excellence and quality that Iris Ceramica Group has always guaranteed. 4D Ceramics, the material produced at the H2 Factory, represents the jewel in the Group's crown, expressing all the beauty and nobility of this natural material, used to serve the high-end furnishing market. In parallel to the test phase, in the coming months Edison Next will start all the activities required to install the final system, a plant producing green hydrogen through electrolysis with a capacity of 1 MW and able to produce around 132 tonnes of green hydrogen a year, which will be used to power the kiln with a blend of methane and green hydrogen up to around 50%.

It was unveiled as part of the Energy Boat Challenge.\n\nHe wanted to do the Dakar Rally in a hydrogen buggy. This project eventually led to the creation of Inocel (a manufacturer of high-power fuel cells) and a project for sport. At the finish line, the adventurer became the honorary captain of a very high-performance boat, named Pos\u00e9idon. The boat features an Inocel hydrogen fuel cell. This laboratory boat, a runabout designed by Tullio Abatte, retains all the characteristics of its internal combustion counterpart: same speed, power, weight, recharge time and range. The difference is that there are no carbon emissions or noise pollution.\n\nThis innovative boat has been developed in partnership with GEKO, which are experts in integrating hydrogen solutions into propulsion chains. Fitted with Inocel fuel cells - \"unique in terms of their power, efficiency, compactness and responsiveness, with no equivalent on the market\", says the manufacturer - the Pos\u00e9idon considerably reduces the need for batteries. This marks a paradigm shift in hydrogen mobility.\n\nDesigned to match the performance of internal combustion engines without compromise, this racing boat embodies the future of carbon-free maritime transport, combining exceptional performance with respect for the environment.\n\nDo you want to learn more about Inocel and its hydrogen fuel cells?

Recently, an automotive supplier from Germany, Robert Bosch, has designed this hydrogen injection system as a middle category between the conventional automotive powertrain and future electric vehicles. This system is a major evolutionary step in the combustion engine on the path to CO2 neutrality and offers a practical and easily scalable solution for various types of vehicles.\n\nThe Bosch's hydrogen injection system entails different parts that interact to produce clean and efficient power. The system has a hydrogen port-fuel injector that provides accurate gas delivery to the cylinders. This modular injector structure enables various flow rates with the same general construction.\n\nThe hydrogen injection rail is manufactured from materials compatible with H2, including pressure and temperature sensors. And pressure loss from the rail inlet to the injectors is low. An electronic pressure regulator controls the amount of gas homogenized and combusted through rail pressure. Finally, the electronic engine control unit acts as the master unit of the system and controls it.\n\nThe drawback of such an approach can be called the lack of a unified approach. At the same time, one of the greatest benefits of Bosch's hydrogen injection system is compatibility with conventional diesel and natural gas engines. The fundamental layout of the fuel, air, and exhaust systems transcends the powertrain solutions that are currently in use and entails the use of many recognizable system parts. This compatibility is instrumental in the current manufacturing processes' smooth integration and quicker manufacturer adoption.\n\nFurthermore, the communicated system's effectiveness in extreme conditions means that it could be widely recommended for the applications of commercial vehicles as well as off-highway machinery. Proportional to the specific requirements, the port fuel injection design eliminates backfiring. Conversely, variable fuel pressure guarantees precise combustion processes in a wide volume range with high specific power outputs.\n\nUnlike other automotive/original equipment manufacturers who have developed their hydrogen injection systems specifically for cars, Bosch has developed the system for scale in other applications and segments. The system lends itself to both off-highway and on-highway purposes. It has more than sufficient flexibility en route to power applications in commercial vehicles that utilize engines of an industrial nature.\n\nSuch scalability helps to establish that technology can grow and change based on the nature of the market as well as the rules governing this market. Additionally, it is versatile for upgrading existing fleets and hence is a good development plan meant to transition existing vehicles to low-emissions vehicles gradually. Safety and leakage requirements are functions that are also used in Bosch's approach, aspects that are thought to be critical when concerning the use of hydrogen fuel within transport.\n\nThus, Bosch's 'hydrogen injection system' puts the company in a vantage point in the drive for fashioning sustainable mobility solutions and, at the same time, building on existing engine technologies and adding new hydrogen-specific components, Bosch about a system that provides a realistic view towards CO2-neutral mobility. Regarding the advantages of the choices, it is necessary to note that the proposed system is versatile, resistant to disturbances, and compatible with modern production processes, which can interest automobile manufacturers who want to expand the range of powertrains.\n\nSuch systems like Bosch's hydrogen injection system will remain imperative in the unfolding automotive industry as it seeks ways of providing for the environmental expectations while at the same time catering to efficient transportation needs of different sectors. However, like in many emerging technologies and the growth of conventional fuel, there are existing barriers to the centralized usage of hydrogen as a fuel; however, occurrences such as this put the world a step closer to having clean hydrogen-fueled cars across the globe.", "source": {"uri": "ecoticias.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ECOticias.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_injection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuel injection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modularity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cylinder (engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_regulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pressure regulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power-to-weight ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_control_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engine control unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial vehicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Fluid_Handling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Fluid Handling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Control_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Control Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/engine-hydrogencentral.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723059", "eventUri": "eng-9723059", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

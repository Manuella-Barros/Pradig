{"id": 232091830, "title": "Europe's far-right parties gain seats in EU Parliament election", "text": "Voting began on Thursday in the Netherlands and in other countries on Friday and Saturday, but the bulk of EU votes will be cast on Sunday, with France, Germany, Poland and Spain opening their polls and Italy holding a second day of voting. The European Parliament votes on legislation that is key for citizens and businesses in the 27-nation EU. But for many years, voters across the bloc have complained that EU decision-making is complex, distant and disconnected from daily realities, which explains often low turnout in EU elections. \"People don't know who really has the power, between the Commission and Parliament,\" another French voter, Emmanuel, said in a northern Paris polling station. \"And it's true that it raises questions and breeds mistrust which today might not exist if things were clearer,\" the 34-year-old programmer said. The centre-right European People's Party (EPP) is projected in opinion polls to remain the European Parliament's largest group, putting its candidate to head the European Commission, incumbent Ursula von der Leyen of Germany, in pole position for a second term. However, she may need support from some right-wing nationalists, such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, to secure a parliamentary majority, giving Meloni and allies more leverage. The European Parliament will issue an EU-wide exit poll at around 20:30 local time and then a first provisional result after 23:00 local time when the final votes, in Italy, have been cast.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/europes-far-right-parties-gain-seats-eu-parliament-election-4398056", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--dqWKL6oM--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-06-09t002957z_1_lynxmpek5800b_rtroptp_3_eu-election-italy.", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:02:02", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.499}

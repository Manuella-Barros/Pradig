West Australian Sydney forward Logan McDonald \u2014 long linked to a move to the Dockers \u2014 missed a kick after the siren in the pulsating 15.9 (99) to 14.14 (98) defeat that stopped the Swans\u2019 winning streak at 10 games. It proved the Dockers can be serious contenders this season in what now looms as a return to finals. Will Hayward, Nick Blakey and McDonald kicked final quarter goals to chip away at the deficit and tie the scores with less than four minutes to go.

First-year forward Josh Draper \u2014 who was dropped last week \u2014 produced a mammoth defensive effort down the stretch without captain Alex Pearce to keep Fremantle\u2019s dam wall shut.Camera IconJosh Draper played the best game of his fledgling career.Credit: Matt King/AFL Photos/via Getty Images Caleb Serong made a Brownlow-like statement against two of the favourites for the medal and Chad Warner, whose name is on Fremantle\u2019s trade whiteboard, endured a day filled with frustration and riddled with errors. The Swans are the hottest ticket in the big town, but the Dockers stormed the stage. They overwhelmed the overwhelming premiership favourites in a 44-point first quarter \u2014 their highest-scoring of the season. It was Jye Amiss\u2019 turn to enjoy the forward spoils and the resurgence of Sam Sturt continued. The pair kicked three goals each. Fremantle will almost certainly finish the weekend inside the top four. It was a contest that would have looked at home in September. The Dockers kicked the first three goals of the game. Amiss nailed a set shot one minute after the jump and had with a big contested mark on the wing, had a hand in Sturt kicking the next one.Camera IconJye Amiss found his radar.Credit: Matt King/AFL Photos/via Getty Images Luke Jackson was given a 50-metre penalty because Taylor Adams tripped Andrew Brayshaw and thumped a set shot from well outside the arc. They were marching. Hayden Young impacted when he rolled forward, Josh Treacy kicked one and then Jackson pulled out a party trick on the boundary to steer a ball to Bailey Banfield. Sydney\u2019s star quartet of Warner, Taylor Adams, Errol Gulden and Isaac Heeney had combined for 12 touches. The Swans entered the clash with a 7-7 record in opening terms. But they lacked their usual polish and the Dockers forced turnover after turnover in the middle of the ground. They were waiting for a pounce that never came. Fremantle\u2019s defence through the middle of the ground was pivotal in helping their thinned-out and inexperienced backline.Camera IconLuke Ryan stepped up in Pearce\u2019s absence. Credit: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images Justin McInerney\u2019s behind to start the second term levelled the scoring shot count. Caleb Serong\u2019s first goal, where he roved the ball off hands and outmuscled Heeney, put them ahead by 32 points. Fremantle were well prepared and on top of the Swans\u2019 high-profile midfielders, but high-octane Tom Papley added a new element. Brayshaw and Young had been combining to take the ball out the front of stoppages and Serong was the most prolific ball-winner on the ground, but they were forced to defend hard as the Swans worked into the contest. Nat Fyfe\u2019s most clever kick of the season, an outside-of-the-boot ball to find Amiss inside 50, helped the Dockers to a crucial goal on the stroke of half-time. They carried in a 27-point lead. Brodie Grundy came off the ground with a sore shoulder in the third term and Sean Darcy became the dominant force and remained so when he returned. It was timely, too. This became a game where centre-bounce was king. The Swans and Dockers shared goals from the bullseye. So much for coming out the front door \u2014 they\u2019d both been blown off their hinges in a barnstorming seven-goal to-five run that lasted 35 minutes.Camera IconNick Blakey inspired the Swans\u2019 comeback.Credit: Jason McCawley/AFL Photos/via Getty Images Hugh Davies and Josh Draper were worn out and Brandon Walker was battling a shoulder problem as Papley and Hayden McLean threatened to reclaim a game the nominal underdogs had owned. Adams had been sluggish but lifted and Warner\u2019s class peaked through. When McInerney drilled through a ball that had fallen to the back of a contest, Freo\u2019s lead was worth two goals. Justin Longmuir pulled Hugh Davies off at the start of the final term for substitute James Aish in a move that left them at risk of being short at the back. But Draper and Luke Ryan, as well as a goal to Michael Frederick in the last, meant the Dockers held on. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Email Us Copy the Link Register and have your say.

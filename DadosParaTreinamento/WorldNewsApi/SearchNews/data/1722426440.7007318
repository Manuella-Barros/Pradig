{"id": 243368356, "title": "Ian Murray explains Scott Brown captain decision as Raith Rovers boss refuses to rule out striker move", "text": "Ian Murray has revealed that \u2018brilliant\u2019 Scott Brown will stay as Raith Rovers\u2019 captain for the new season. The versatile midfielder skippered the Stark\u2019s Park side to runners-up spot in last term\u2019s Championship title race with Dundee United. The Kirkcaldy outfit then fell just short in the Premiership play-off final against Ross County after squeezing past Partick Thistle in the semi-final. Raith are aiming to go one better next year and have strengthened their squad for the campaign ahead. Callum Fordyce, 32, brings the experience of having been Airdrie\u2019s assistant-manager for the past two years. Meanwhile, Lewis Stevenson, 36, adds the know-how of 600 games at first-team level. Stevenson\u2019s former Hibernian team-mate, Paul Hanlon, 34, was officially named captain of the Easter Road side in 2021 after wearing the armband on numerous occasions. The new signings bring a wealth of knowledge and leadership to Rovers. But Murray is happy for Brown to stay in the skipper\u2019s role after steering the team with assurance on the pitch last season. \u201cBroony, if and when he\u2019s playing, will be the captain of the team,\u201d the Rovers boss told Courier Sport. \u2018We\u2019ve signed a lot of big characters\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s done brilliant for us since he\u2019s come in and in taking on the armband. \u201cWe\u2019ve signed a lot of big characters, that\u2019s for sure, and guys that have been captains of other teams. \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to stop other boys from demanding and barking orders and telling people when things aren\u2019t good enough \u2013 and also telling people when things are good enough. \u201cWe\u2019re building a really, really strong squad in terms of mentality and attitude and demands. \u201cFor me, the more of those kinds of players we have the easier my life will be.\u201d Meanwhile, Murray has not ruled out a possible move for freed Airdrie striker Gabby McGill. Murray signed McGill in 2021 during his spell in charge of the Diamonds before he left to take over at Raith a year later. The former Dunfermline marksman was a shock departure from the Lanarkshire outfit earlier this month and has since been linked with St Johnstone, Partick Thistle and Raith. \u201cI saw we were linked with Gabby,\u201d said Murray. \u2018He\u2019s a wee bit unorthodox at times\u2019 \u201cI was probably a wee bit surprised Gabby left Airdrie, because he was doing really, really well, especially in the second half of the season. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked Gabby. He\u2019s a wee bit unorthodox at times. But he was a good player when I was at Airdrie and he was a good player last season. \u201cIt might be a case of seeing what happens further down the line. \u201cBut, at the moment, we\u2019ve had a busy week with getting back to training and we\u2019ve been pretty quiet [with recruitment].\u201d", "summary": "The Stark's Park boss has plenty of skipper material after summer signings.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/5025848/ian-murray-captain-scott-brown-raith-rovers/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/06/Raith-Training-26th-of-June-24-8-3fswpbbit-e1719621123696.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:30:46", "author": "Iain Collin", "authors": ["Iain Collin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.285}

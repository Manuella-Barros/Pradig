The prestigious event will recognize chefs and restaurants across 22 categories, showcasing a diverse array of cuisines and expertise. Among the most anticipated categories are Outstanding Restaurateur, Outstanding Chef, and Best Restaurant. Baobab Fare is one of five finalists for the Outstanding Restaurateur award. Chef Hamissi Mamba and his wife, Nadia Nijimbere, founded Baobab Fare as a pop-up in 2017 after moving to Detroit from Burundi. \u201cI came to Detroit joining my wife in 2015, where she came before me in 2013, both came as refugees,\u201d Mamba said in a video interview with the Associated Press. \u201cWe didn\u2019t speak the language, you can imagine how life was not easy for us and [we] couldn\u2019t get a job. The idea was \u2018how can we survive?\u2019 and then Nadia came up with idea of opening a restaurant.\u201d Quickly, Baobab became a success. The couple opened their brick-and-mortar location in Detroit\u2019s New Center area in 2021, followed by a sister food truck named Waka in 2022. In the last few months, they\u2019ve secured a second location for Baobab on the city\u2019s east side and a brick-and-mortar spot for Waka in Eastern Market. After being semifinalists for the past three years, this is the first time Baobab Fare has advanced to the final round of the James Beard Awards. \u201cThis is already a win for us,\u201d Mamba continued in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing, it\u2019s a big deal. We inspire a lot of refugees who are coming to this country without hope and one day thinking that they can win this kind of title. It\u2019s a big deal for us because we want to show people that this world can be equal.\u201d We\u2019re rooting for Baobab Fare and Detroit. The only other Michigan finalist is metro Detroit chef Hajime Sato of Sozai in Clawson, who is in the running for Best Chef in the Great Lakes region. Sato was one of the five local chefs named as semifinalists for this category, alongside Doug Hewitt of Detroit\u2019s Freya, Ji Hye Kim of Ann Arbor\u2019s Miss Kim, Dan Klenotic of Bellflower in Ypsilanti, and John Yelinek of Ladder 4 Wine Bar in Detroit. Other local restaurants in the semifinals included AlTayeb, Nepantla Cafe, Selden Standard, and more. The 2024 James Beard Award winners will be announced on Monday at a ceremony held in Chicago.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://media1.metrotimes.com/metrotimes/imager/u/magnum/36484238/annual-convening-_145-of-452_.jpg?cb=1717951747\" width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" />\n      This year\u2019s James Beard Awards ceremony is happening on Monday and Detroit\u2019's popular East African restaurant Baobab Fare is in the running.

A community plagued by a housing crisis and power struggles with the tourism industry were among the issues tested in the aftermath of the wildfire.\n\nThere has been much progress in the year since the fires, and yet a lot remains to be done, according to community leaders who have witnessed the transformation in West Maui. The emotional scars are especially raw, and affordable housing within and surrounding the burn zone remains a central issue, Maui County council member Keani Rawlins-Fernandez told ABC News.\n\nMaui - and the Hawaiian Islands as a whole - have been facing a housing crisis that predates the wildfire tragedy. The destruction highlighted the state's ongoing struggles with high housing costs, lack of affordable housing options, and low wages.\n\nThese are the major developments in West Maui in the year since the wildfires:\n\nWest Maui reopened for tourism on Oct. 8, just two months after the outbreak of the wildfires. The decision was considered controversial, with business owners calling for economic relief and a return to normalcy and residents insisting they needed more time to heal and recover.\n\nThe initial reopening entailed that Lahaina would remain closed to the public, but the decision still sparked outrage from some members in the community, thousands of whom remained displaced and were taking up refuge at West Maui hotels, ABC News previously reported. Many had not yet been allowed back to the burn sites to survey the damage of their homes and feared that they would be kicked out of hotels to allow paying customers to stay in their place, community members told ABC News.\n\nSEE ALSO: How Lahaina's more than 150-year-old banyan tree is coming back to life after devastating fire\n\nTourism in West Maui opened before survivors of the fire were able to secure housing -- exacerbating an affordable housing crisis that existed long before the fires, said Rawlins-Fernandez. Rent prices for vacation rentals rose astronomically as a result of the reopening, and at least 1,400 people have left Maui in the past year, she added.\n\nDays before the reopening for tourism, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green stated that while he was sympathetic to those who were not ready for visitors to return, Maui and the state needed the money that the tourists bring. The number of visitors to Maui plummeted by 70% following the fires, The Associated Press reported in September.\n\n\"On October 8, 2023, we welcomed the return of visitors to West Maui to support Maui's economy and keep our people employed so they can continue to live on Maui and recover,\" Green said in an emailed statement to ABC News. \"We continue to encourage respectful travel, supporting local businesses and participation in volunteer opportunities that mlama (give back to) Hawai'i. With targeted efforts and campaigns showcasing Maui's readiness to welcome visitors, we are committed to supporting the state and Maui's economic recovery and hope to see continuous improvements over the upcoming months.\"\n\nIn Maui, 70% of every dollar is generated directly or indirectly by the visitor industry, according to the Maui Economic Development Board.\n\nSEE ALSO: Parties in lawsuits seeking damages for Maui fires reach $4B global settlement, court filings say\n\nBut the community rallied, and locals groups continue to work tirelessly to find affordable housing for residents -- a project that will undoubtedly be long-term, Rawlins-Fernandez said.\n\nBy December, some of the most iconic locations in West Maui began to reopen.\n\nPlaces like Banyan Tree Park, the Lahaina public library and the opening of an elementary school marked positive milestones as the arduous cleanup and recovery process continued.\n\nBut just four months before, such swift progress may have seemed unthinkable.\n\nWhen the fires broke out, Timothy Griffin, the County of Maui arborist who cares for the historic banyan tree, said he heard through \"coconut wireless,\" the island's unofficial phone tree in which information spreads like wildfire, that the 150-year-old tree that often serves as the symbol of Lahaina had been destroyed to ash.\n\nDrone footage that showed browned and curled leaves still attached to the tree proved the rumor mill very wrong, a good indicator that it wasn't completely burned and charred, Griffin said.\n\n\"I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a pile of ash,\" he said.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'There's just nothing left.' Maui resident jumped into ocean to escape flames that overtook his home\n\nThe tree was protected by its surroundings. The fire stayed high, flashing over the top of the canopy toward the old courthouse on the other side of the park -- the walls of which are made of thick concrete, preventing the fire from roaring back at a lower level and destroying the trunk, Griffin said.\n\nThe beloved tree was heavily damaged, but by September it started to show signs of growth.\n\nThe recovery that arborists expected to see in three months happened in three weeks, a stark sign that the famous banyan tree would survive and thrive, Griffin said. About 40% of the tree was lost, so the dead wood has been removed, and the tree will undergo a form of \"reconstructive surgery\" over the next 10 to 20 years to guide and prune the new growth to become a new canopy.\n\nThe reopening of Bayan Tree Park, well as the library and schools, can seem like hollow celebrations when Maui residents still don't have a place to live, Rawlins-Fernandez said. But watching the children of West Maui rise up from the tragedy has brought the community the most hope and joy in the past year, he added.\n\nEvents like school plays and high school football games have provided the community with a forum for normalcy -- especially in a time when students are still being bussed into their campuses from all over the island, where housing is more available, a stark reminder of the work left to be done, Rawlins-Fernandez said.\n\nOnce the fires were contained, it became immediately clear that the environmental impact would last for years to come. Debris and toxic chemicals, much of it byproduct from coming into contact with the inferno, littered West Maui.\n\nOne year after the fire, cleanup efforts have surpassed what many federal, state and local agencies thought were possible during the time frame, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Col. Eric Swenson told ABC News.\n\nAs a result of the fires, the power grid was destroyed; water service interrupted; entire neighborhoods destroyed; and a seemingly never-ending pile of debris to dispose of from a small island.\n\nBut the workers, many of whom live in West Maui, worked diligently. By late July, nearly all of the 1,399 homes in Lahaina had been removed, with dozens being built in Lahaina and Kula, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen told Hawaii News Now. Water is expected to be restored to Lahaina by August and wastewater by January, Bissen said, adding that all projects are ahead of schedule.\n\nSwenson believes the participation by locals fueled the recovery efforts -- power, water, sewer, debris and housing.\n\n\"There was an awful lot of people from the community who are invested in the success of this recovery operation, and that allowed us to go faster than probably any other recovery effort that we've undertaken,\" he said.\n\nResidential debris removal is expected to be done by January and commercial debris removal by February, Swenson said.\n\nThe biggest long-term development in the year since the wildfires regarding Hawaii's housing crisis may be a bill signed into law by Hawaii Gov. Josh Green that gives counties more authority to regulate short-term vacation rentals.\n\nIn West Maui, almost half of all dwellings were used solely as short-term vacation rentals to be rented out to tourists, according to state officials.\n\n\"We know the majority of STRs in Hawai'i are illegal, owned by non-residents, and contribute to skyrocketing housing costs,\" Green said in a post on X at the time.\n\nAs Maui County also phases out short-term rentals, hundreds of families impacted by the wildfire continue to utilize rental assistance, mortgage assistance, and temporary housing backed by federal, state, and local agencies.\n\nIn April, a collaborative effort between the state, Maui County, Hawai'i Community Foundation, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement and others announced 50 two-bedroom homes to be given to displaced families with donated furniture.\n\nIn June, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands awarded 52 turnkey homes -- homes that don't require major repairs or improvements -- to Native Hawaiian residents in Waikap, Maui, with prices between $509,800 to $699,000.\n\nThe department plans to award 137 turnkey homes total and 24 improved vacant lots in the region.\n\n\"The department will persistently seek out lands in areas we can establish secure and resilient communities for those we serve,\" Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Director Kali Watson told ABC News. \"The people of Maui have faced numerous challenges since the wildfires. We hope these homes will inspire and uplift a community recovering from a devastating tragedy.\"\n\nFEMA has also leased residential properties for more than 1,200 households who needed temporary housing for either 18 months or until February 2025.\n\nThe agency says it plans to complete Kilohana, a group housing site expected to contain 169 units for eligible survivors to use for temporary housing, by October 2024.\n\nThe news of longer term housing comes as the state concludes its Non-Congregate Sheltering program, which provided shelter and assistance to 7,796 individuals and 3,071 households displaced by the Lahaina wildfires,.\n\nEmergency assistance programs from federal and state programs have continued to play a role in supporting affected residents in the months following the tragedy.\n\nBut now, residents say support from the community on Maui and beyond lending a helping hand has been a major source of stability.\n\nOne group called Help Maui Rise says it disperses 100% of donated funds directly to families without any administrative or processing fees.\n\n\"We would get messages from people just thanking us for $100 and it was really heartbreaking because it seems like so little ... We realized that $100 could mean dinner, it could mean groceries, it could mean baby formula, it's stuff that you just assume they have the money for,\" Kenna Reed, co-founder of Help Maui Rise, told ABC News.\n\nMaui residents who lost everything in the island's wildfires say they have forgotten what normal life felt like before the tragedy. Community-born programs like Help Maui Rise have not only offered financial support but also emotional support, they say.\n\nAfter the fires, Lahaina resident Dusty Renan says he stepped down from his role managing a company he had held for 18 years.\n\nHe told ABC News that the stress, anxiety and depression he faced in the months after losing his family's apartment and all their belongings made the break a necessity for his health and family.\n\nAccessing funding from larger organizations has proven difficult, he says, with Renan getting rejected or fighting through red tape to get assistance for his family. That's when community-backed organizations stepped in.\n\n\"We made it through thanks to resources and people - it's the people that really made a difference in all of this. And it was the people that kind of gave us hope and kind of helped us to move forward,\" said Renan.\n\nHe added, \"I just want Lahaina back, I want Lahaina to be strong.\"\n\nZoe Chesson, a mother with two young children, told ABC News that her family stayed with friends and relatives immediately after the wildfires destroyed their home, but eventually had to move off Maui to the Island of Hawaii, or the Big Island, following the tragedy.\n\n\"Everything is starting completely from scratch,\" Chesson told ABC News. \"It's been kind of a journey.\"\n\nChesson, who lived in Lahaina all her life, said that the tight-knit community is unlike any other.\n\nShe recalled an experience when she had been grilling outside, and neighbors had seen the smoke and came to check on the family to make sure they didn't have a fire.\n\n\"My husband and I looked at each other and we were like, we can never live anywhere else,\" said Chesson.", "source": {"uri": "abc7chicago.com", "dataType":

While seven staff members lost their homes, the remaining five lost their jobs because Maui Surfer Girls had to close its business.\n\nMore than $120,000 of the donations went to help Tester's staff members, and the remaining funds are allocated to scholarships for the surfing camps hosted by the surf school.\n\nTester said it was also important to allocate a portion of the donations toward scholarships for surfing camps because, since the fires, business has been slow. If she cannot attract clients, it would have a domino effect, potentially leading to layoffs of her instructors, which she hopes to avoid.\n\nOverwhelming support\n\nWith nearly 1,000 donors, Tester said the community's support meant much more to her than financial aid from government agencies or the loans she received because it represented genuine care and solidarity.\n\nShe also noted that the GoFundMe page doesn't fully capture all the donations, as her instructors received individual contributions of various amounts through Venmo from clients.\n\n\"It was so heartfelt to see the overwhelming support from the community,\" Tester said. \"I appreciated all the government assistance, but the support from tourists and clients far exceeded what the county and government provided.\"\n\nAnother small business in Lahaina that was destroyed, Baya Bowls, received donations from tourists on its GoFundMe page.\n\nIsabel Velazquez, from Chicago, wrote on Ceone Nojima-Jacinto's GoFundMe page, \"Visited on a quick trip to Lahaina and felt the magic of the town just by sitting down and enjoying Baya Bowls! I'll cherish all my memories there. Great serv\u00adice! This small business deserves a chance to rebuild just like the rest of Lahaina. Sending lots of love from Chicago.\"\n\nThe GoFundMe page also reached an international audience, including Caroline Kropack: \"Every time we have visited Maui from Melbourne Australia we always went to Baya Bowls. One of our favorite places on the beautiful island. Maui holds a special place in our hearts as it was where we were married. Being operators of a food business ourselves, we have always admired Ceone's passion and her beautiful business. We were heartbroken to see what's been happening to so many there in Lahaina. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all. We know the wondrous and unique spirit of the islands will continue to give you all strength.\"\n\nBaya Bowls, owned by Nojima-Jacinto, had been operating for nearly eight years before the fires but has not been able to reopen since. Nojima-Jacinto's sister created a GoFundMe page with a goal of raising $25,000. By the end of July, the campaign received over 300 donations, totaling more than $30,000.\n\n\"Things were going pretty well; we even survived through COVID,\" she said. \"But when the fires happened we lost both food trucks.\n\n\"Everyone around us lost their homes, but we didn't lose ours. It puts things into perspective. It was hard to grieve for the business because there were so many bigger and more important issues for everyone else. There was just so much going on at the time.\"\n\nThree of Nojima-Jacinto's four employees lost their homes, and she said she was able to continue paying their salaries for a few months. Additionally, she distributed checks to them for fire relief using the GoFundMe funds.\n\nDirecting donations\n\nWhen disaster strikes around the world, many people direct their donations to United Way and similar organizations.\n\nAloha United Way Vice President Agnieszka Westfal- Conboy said approximately two-thirds of the disaster relief funds AUW received after the wildfires came from the mainland, rather than Hawaii.\n\nAs of July 29, AUW raised over $4.2 million for the Maui Fire Relief Fund, with all proceeds going directly to support Maui United Way's relief efforts where it distributed over $7.8 million to nearly 8,000 fire-affected people shortly after the fires.\n\nHawaii Community Foundation President Micah Kane expressed his gratification that resources have been reaching the right people.\n\n\"We're going to continue to learn from this and ensure that resources keep reaching those in need,\" he said.\n\nKane said the Maui Strong Fund under HCF has raised $195 million from over 240,000 individual donors and more than 5,000 corporate contributors across 78 countries and all U.S. states and territories.\n\nThe interest earned from donations, which is reinvested into the fund, has accumulated to approximately $5 million.\n\nAccording to Kane, the Maui Strong Fund has the highest amount he has ever seen across all HCF funds.\n\n\"We're still accepting contributions,\" Kane said. \"The contribution per week varies, but it's starting to go down and we've accepted that.\"\n\nOf the Maui Strong Fund, there's still about $85 million remaining.\n\n\"We want to be here for Maui, and we're keeping the fund active as long as people are wanting to give support,\" Kane said. \"We're going to find that in the later months a lot of these federal resources are going to dry up. We want to be strategically positioned to support the communities where it's needed most.\"\n\nKane said HCF plans to continue distributing resources, with the approach being heavily guided by community input and collaboration with community partners.\n\nHe mentioned that most of the funding has been allocated to supporting community members with case management, particularly in helping them complete forms for grant applications.\n\n\"Some of the recent grants were made to organizations that are trying to help fill gaps that government systems are missing,\" Kane said. \"Government has some limitations in how they can operate, and we don't have those limitations.\"\n\nOther funds\n\nSome other funding sources, including the People's Fund of Maui, had been exhausted as of late February. The fund was established Aug. 31, committing $10 million to provide direct cash payments to Maui residents whose homes were lost or uninhabitable.\n\nLahaina residents Keahi Ho and Ali Grimes, who lost both their private sailing charter business, Gungho Sailing, and their home to the fires, were recipients of the People's Fund of Maui, which provided monthly \"allowances\" to residents affected by the fires.\n\nStarting Sept. 19 and continuing through late February, the organization distributed $1,200 per month to over 8,100 Maui residents for six months, totaling nearly $60 million.\n\nPartners Ho and Grimes used the monthly funding to help rebuild their lives in Lahaina.\n\n\"It really helped us survive through the first six months,\" Ho said. \"We had to reestablish our entire life, which involved a lot of expenses and costs. At the time, we were also taking care of five kids, my mom and some friends.\"\n\nGrimes purchased a home in April 2023 and had been working on building it, but after the fires they needed to do significantly more work to make it livable.\n\n\"It's had a huge financial impact on our lives,\" Grimes said. \"We're looking into year one feeling pretty great about overall financial support, but year two is looking financially more difficult for our family, being stuck in limbo, not being able to reopen our business.\"\n\n\"Every single person we know from Lahaina has suffered quite a bit, whether they have insurance or are underinsured, whether they have a business open or they can't get back to their business. It's not at all what it was. We've been trying to remain positive and do our best through all the pivoting, but it's a long turn pit for everybody.\"", "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Grief. Mistrust. Pending doom. Uncertainty.\n\n\"Lately, it's not so much the date itself but the coming toward that date,\" she told USA TODAY of the Maui wildfire anniversary. \"For me, this past month has been a lot more triggering, a lot more emotional.\"\n\nTo I'i and her family, Lahaina is their home - it has been and will be. She and her family have spent the past year navigating chaos and adjusting to a new normal following the wildfires. After their three-bedroom house burned down, the family were housed in a hotel then moved into a small studio on her great-aunt's property in Lahaina.\n\nI'i said she feels blessed to still live in her hometown, even if it's in the trauma-laced burn zone. Her home will be rebuilt by Habitat for Humanity, but she said not everyone else is so lucky.\n\nMaui is still grieving. Here's how travelers can help.\n\nHer parents, who are retired, also lost their house in what was the deadliest wildfire in recent U.S. history and will have to move to a different island, Oahu. Now they must pay rent after after making mortgage payments. When they can return to Maui is up in the air for now.\n\n\"Everybody's lifestyle has changed,\" she said. \"My parents are going through a time where they worked their whole lives for their home, the home burned and where do you go from there?\"\n\nI'i and her family are not alone in their feelings. Thursday marks the anniversary of the wildfires that ravaged historic Lahaina Town, which killed over 100 people and destroyed homes, cultural sites, and businesses alike. As the Lahaina community continues to work toward recovery - both emotionally and logistically - many questions remain unanswered.\n\nStruggling financially alongside the emotional burden, nearly half of the fire survivors have said they are \"very seriously\" or \"somewhat seriously\" thinking about leaving the island. Research from the Maui Together Wildfire Assessment found that one-third of the family members of survivors have already left.\n\nThe anniversary also serves as a reminder of the deep love and sense of community that Lahaina residents have for their town, the former capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom. This is where many find hope at the chance to rebuild their home, refusing to give up on a new, brighter future for Lahaina, even if it will be years down the line.\n\n\"I love Lahaina so much,\" I'i said. \"That's it for me.\"\n\n'A phoenix from the ashes': How the landmark tree is faring a year after Maui wildfire\n\nThe biggest loss was community\n\nBaby Beach was once a beloved local spot in Lahaina, a place where \"everybody would go\" to play in its gentle waters and relax on the sand, according to I'i. Now, I'i thinks of loss when she sees the beach, of the people who had to jump over the rock wall to escape the inferno. \"You see that and it's that heavy feeling,\" she said. \"I think of things such as pilina, or connectedness, our beaches being full of people, and it's really hard to move on.\"\n\nI'i misses running into her neighbors in the grocery store. \"You lost the community, not just losing your home,\" she said. \"Being away from each other has been the biggest loss.\"\n\nDespite how sprawling Maui is - the second-largest island in Hawaii - its community is close-knit.\n\nIn the face of a challenging year, the Maui community has shown remarkable resilience, with grassroots organizations like Lahaina Strong, local restaurants, and citizens stepping up to provide disaster relief when they felt government support fell short.\n\nSince the fires, I'i has been heavily involved in community meetings and mental health outreach. In the immediate aftermath, she went from hotel to hotel to check on those who were displaced to let them know of resources to help them cope with the grief. Sometimes they just talked about what they went through to \"have that shared experience,\" she said. Speaking with another local rather than emergency responders who arrived on the island, people were \"way more open.\"\n\nNow she is working with the Department of Health to establish the Ke Ola Hou Resiliency Center which will serve as a space for the Lahaina community to get mental and physical health and other social services. It's a critical resource as 64% of those impacted by the fires said their mental health has worsened, according to a recent assessment of over 1,000 fire survivors by the Hawaii State Rural Health Association.\n\n\"Being involved, being able to help other people really helps me,\" she said. \"I get to see people in my community. It's familiar, it's hopeful.\"\n\nBefore the tragedy, life in Maui wasn't only paradise. The island was already facing challenges such as a high cost of living and a housing crisis. In 2021, Maui had the most expensive median rent in the state, according to the 2023 Hawaii Housing Factbook. Housing affordability has been equally difficult for Maui locals, with the median single-family home costing $1 million.\n\nThe devastating fires only exacerbated these concerns for those impacted by the fires, according to the Hawaii State Rural Health Association's assessment. Sixty-nine percent say they're now worse off financially, cutting back on groceries and medical insurance. On Friday, Maui County expanded its Homeowner Assistance Fund on Friday to a total of $21 million for owners to receive up to $60,000 for housing-related expenses like mortgage payments.\n\nOn Maui, short-term rentals account for 15% of the total housing supply, a number that Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen wants to reduce. In May, he proposed a bill to convert over 7,000 of those into long-term rentals by 2026 - approximately 2,200 are in West Maui.\n\n\"Some of the problems as a business operator is we can't hire help because there's no places to live,\" said Peter Merriman, owner of Merriman's Kapalua, just north of Lahaina. \"Everybody who works there has to commute from other parts of the island.\"\n\nMost families are living in limbo due to lengthy insurance processes and awaiting payments from the recent $4 billion settlement agreement from the lawsuit against Hawaiian Electric, which some say was responsible for the fire.\n\nPeter Longhi is also grieving the loss of his family home. \"I didn't lose where we were living but I lost everything from my childhood,\" he said. \"It's just gone, it's really sad.\" He's not quite sure yet if he'll be able to rebuild his house. \"We're planning to, we're hoping to.\"\n\nLonghi inherited Longhi's, a namesake Italian restaurant located on Kaanapali Beach in the Marriott Ocean Club, from his father. Many of his employees lost their homes and had been living in the hotels. \"Dealing with that emotionally, it's been terrible,\" he said. \"Coming up on a year, it still gets you at random times.\"\n\nFor Longhi, the hardest part of recovery is the uncertainty. What will become of Front Street, once the most patronized part of Maui? Will there be enough jobs or housing in the rebuilding of Lahaina? How much will it cost to rebuild his home?\n\n\"Nobody knows the answer, and that's what I think is frustrating and saddening to everybody is just not knowing,\" he said.\n\n\u25fe Banana trees are sprouting, offering specks of vibrant green life among the ashes.\n\nMany look toward the past to inform Lahaina's future - the town was built upon a wetland called Moku'ula and a royal fishpond known as Mokuhinia. It was once so abundant it was called the \"Venice of the Pacific.\" Breadfruit trees and others were planted around the sacred resource, offering shade and food. Freed from infrastructure and given the space and time to breathe, the groundwater and streams have begun to reflow.\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green and other officials are coordinating with Native Hawaiian-led Lahaina nonprofits like Na Aikane o Maui to restore the cultural site. This regeneration offers renewed strength to Lahaina residents.\n\n\"I never thought it would happen in my lifetime,\" I'i said. \"Instead of having a bunch of tourist drops on Front Street and catering to tourism, I hope there is cultural preservation from the beginning of Moku'ula.\"\n\nRebuilding Lahaina not only offers an opportunity to honor its cultural history but also reshape the town with improved, more resilient infrastructure. As the deadly flames raged, many people were unable to get out because of downed power lines and locked gates, according to a recent report, commissioned by the Hawaii attorney general and published by the Fire Safety Research Institute. Failed pipes meant water couldn't flow from the fire hydrants.\n\nUnfortunately, rebuilding the town will take years, with some architects estimating seven to eight years. Heartbreakingly, some of the kupuna (elders) may not see their revitalized Lahaina.\n\nStill, construction is already underway for a handful of Lahaina homes and more permits are applied for each day. New houses are slated to be outfitted with roofing and other materials to better withstand high winds and wildfires. It will be a long way to go, but those who call Lahaina home push forward.\n\n\"I don't want to just survive here, I want to be able to thrive here,\" I'i said.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com",

A community plagued by a housing crisis and power struggles with the tourism industry were among the issues tested in the aftermath of the wildfire.\n\nThere has been much progress in the year since the fires, and yet a lot remains to be done, according to community leaders who have witnessed the transformation in West Maui. The emotional scars are especially raw, and affordable housing within and surrounding the burn zone remains a central issue, Maui County council member Keani Rawlins-Fernandez told ABC News.\n\nMaui - and the Hawaiian Islands as a whole - have been facing a housing crisis that predates the wildfire tragedy. The destruction highlighted the state's ongoing struggles with high housing costs, lack of affordable housing options, and low wages.\n\nThese are the major developments in West Maui in the year since the wildfires:\n\nReopening of tourism\n\nWest Maui reopened for tourism on Oct. 8, just two months after the outbreak of the wildfires. The decision was considered controversial, with business owners calling for economic relief and a return to normalcy and residents insisting they needed more time to heal and recover.\n\nThe initial reopening entailed that Lahaina would remain closed to the public, but the decision still sparked outrage from some members in the community, thousands of whom remained displaced and were taking up refuge at West Maui hotels, ABC News previously reported. Many had not yet been allowed back to the burn sites to survey the damage of their homes and feared that they would be kicked out of hotels to allow paying customers to stay in their place, community members told ABC News.\n\nTourism in West Maui opened before survivors of the fire were able to secure housing -- exacerbating an affordable housing crisis that existed long before the fires, said Rawlins-Fernandez. Rent prices for vacation rentals rose astronomically as a result of the reopening, and at least 1,400 people have left Maui in the past year, she added.\n\nDays before the reopening for tourism, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green stated that while he was sympathetic to those who were not ready for visitors to return, Maui and the state needed the money that the tourists bring. The number of visitors to Maui plummeted by 70% following the fires, The Associated Press reported in September.\n\n\"On October 8, 2023, we welcomed the return of visitors to West Maui to support Maui's economy and keep our people employed so they can continue to live on Maui and recover,\" Green said in an emailed statement to ABC News. \"We continue to encourage respectful travel, supporting local businesses and participation in volunteer opportunities that m\u0101lama (give back to) Hawai'i. With targeted efforts and campaigns showcasing Maui's readiness to welcome visitors, we are committed to supporting the state and Maui's economic recovery and hope to see continuous improvements over the upcoming months.\"\n\nIn Maui, 70% of every dollar is generated directly or indirectly by the visitor industry, according to the Maui Economic Development Board.\n\nBut the community rallied, and locals groups continue to work tirelessly to find affordable housing for residents -- a project that will undoubtedly be long-term, Rawlins-Fernandez said.\n\nReopening of key locations in West Maui\n\nBy December, some of the most iconic locations in West Maui began to reopen.\n\nPlaces like Banyan Tree Park, the Lahaina public library and the opening of an elementary school marked positive milestones as the arduous cleanup and recovery process continued.\n\nBut just four months before, such swift progress may have seemed unthinkable.\n\nWhen the fires broke out, Timothy Griffin, the County of Maui arborist who cares for the historic banyan tree, said he heard through \"coconut wireless,\" the island's unofficial phone tree in which information spreads like wildfire, that the 150-year-old tree that often serves as the symbol of Lahaina had been destroyed to ash.\n\nDrone footage that showed browned and curled leaves still attached to the tree proved the rumor mill very wrong, a good indicator that it wasn't completely burned and charred, Griffin said.\n\n\"I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a pile of ash,\" he said.\n\nThe tree was protected by its surroundings. The fire stayed high, flashing over the top of the canopy toward the old courthouse on the other side of the park -- the walls of which are made of thick concrete, preventing the fire from roaring back at a lower level and destroying the trunk, Griffin said.\n\nThe beloved tree was heavily damaged, but by September it started to show signs of growth.\n\nThe recovery that arborists expected to see in three months happened in three weeks, a stark sign that the famous banyan tree would survive and thrive, Griffin said. About 40% of the tree was lost, so the dead wood has been removed, and the tree will undergo a form of \"reconstructive surgery\" over the next 10 to 20 years to guide and prune the new growth to become a new canopy.\n\nThe reopening of Bayan Tree Park, well as the library and schools, can seem like hollow celebrations when Maui residents still don't have a place to live, Rawlins-Fernandez said. But watching the children of West Maui rise up from the tragedy has brought the community the most hope and joy in the past year, he added.\n\nEvents like school plays and high school football games have provided the community with a forum for normalcy -- especially in a time when students are still being bussed into their campuses from all over the island, where housing is more available, a stark reminder of the work left to be done, Rawlins-Fernandez said.\n\nCleanup ahead of schedule\n\nOnce the fires were contained, it became immediately clear that the environmental impact would last for years to come. Debris and toxic chemicals, much of it byproduct from coming into contact with the inferno, littered West Maui.\n\nOne year after the fire, cleanup efforts have surpassed what many federal, state and local agencies thought were possible during the time frame, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Col. Eric Swenson told ABC News.\n\nAs a result of the fires, the power grid was destroyed; water service interrupted; entire neighborhoods destroyed; and a seemingly never-ending pile of debris to dispose of from a small island.\n\nBut the workers, many of whom live in West Maui, worked diligently. By late July, nearly all of the 1,399 homes in Lahaina had been removed, with dozens being built in Lahaina and Kula, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen told Hawaii News Now. Water is expected to be restored to Lahaina by August and wastewater by January, Bissen said, adding that all projects are ahead of schedule.\n\nSwenson believes the participation by locals fueled the recovery efforts -- power, water, sewer, debris and housing.\n\n\"There was an awful lot of people from the community who are invested in the success of this recovery operation, and that allowed us to go faster than probably any other recovery effort that we've undertaken,\" he said.\n\nResidential debris removal is expected to be done by January and commercial debris removal by February, Swenson said.\n\nStrides being made on housing on Maui\n\nThe biggest long-term development in the year since the wildfires regarding Hawaii's housing crisis may be a bill signed into law by Hawaii Gov. Josh Green that gives counties more authority to regulate short-term vacation rentals.\n\nIn West Maui, almost half of all dwellings were used solely as short-term vacation rentals to be rented out to tourists, according to state officials.\n\n\"We know the majority of STRs in Hawai'i are illegal, owned by non-residents, and contribute to skyrocketing housing costs,\" Green said in a post on X at the time.\n\nAs Maui County also phases out short-term rentals, hundreds of families impacted by the wildfire continue to utilize rental assistance, mortgage assistance, and temporary housing backed by federal, state, and local agencies.\n\nIn April, a collaborative effort between the state, Maui County, Hawai'i Community Foundation, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement and others announced 50 two-bedroom homes to be given to displaced families with donated furniture.\n\nIn June, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands awarded 52 turnkey homes -- homes that don't require major repairs or improvements -- to Native Hawaiian residents in Waikap\u016b, Maui, with prices between $509,800 to $699,000.\n\nThe department plans to award 137 turnkey homes total and 24 improved vacant lots in the region.\n\n\"The department will persistently seek out lands in areas we can establish secure and resilient communities for those we serve,\" Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Director Kali Watson told ABC News. \"The people of Maui have faced numerous challenges since the wildfires. We hope these homes will inspire and uplift a community recovering from a devastating tragedy.\"\n\nFEMA has also leased residential properties for more than 1,200 households who needed temporary housing for either 18 months or until February 2025.\n\nThe agency says it plans to complete Kilohana, a group housing site expected to contain 169 units for eligible survivors to use for temporary housing, by October 2024.\n\nThe news of longer term housing comes as the state concludes its Non-Congregate Sheltering program, which provided shelter and assistance to 7,796 individuals and 3,071 households displaced by the Lahaina wildfires,.\n\nCommunity looks within for support\n\nEmergency assistance programs from federal and state programs have continued to play a role in supporting affected residents in the months following the tragedy.\n\nBut now, residents say support from the community on Maui and beyond lending a helping hand has been a major source of stability.\n\nOne group called Help Maui Rise says it disperses 100% of donated funds directly to families without any administrative or processing fees.\n\n\"We would get messages from people just thanking us for $100 and it was really heartbreaking because it seems like so little ... We realized that $100 could mean dinner, it could mean groceries, it could mean baby formula, it's stuff that you just assume they have the money for,\" Kenna Reed, co-founder of Help Maui Rise, told ABC News.\n\nMaui residents who lost everything in the island's wildfires say they have forgotten what normal life felt like before the tragedy. Community-born programs like Help Maui Rise have not only offered financial support but also emotional support, they say.\n\nAfter the fires, Lahaina resident Dusty Renan says he stepped down from his role managing a company he had held for 18 years.\n\nHe told ABC News that the stress, anxiety and depression he faced in the months after losing his family's apartment and all their belongings made the break a necessity for his health and family.\n\nAccessing funding from larger organizations has proven difficult, he says, with Renan getting rejected or fighting through red tape to get assistance for his family. That's when community-backed organizations stepped in.\n\n\"We made it through thanks to resources and people - it's the people that really made a difference in all of this. And it was the people that kind of gave us hope and kind of helped us to move forward,\" said Renan.\n\nHe added, \"I just want Lahaina back, I want Lahaina to be strong.\"\n\nZoe Chesson, a mother with two young children, told ABC News that her family stayed with friends and relatives immediately after the wildfires destroyed their home, but eventually had to move off Maui to the Island of Hawaii, or the Big Island, following the tragedy.\n\n\"Everything is starting completely from scratch,\" Chesson told ABC News. \"It's been kind of a journey.\"\n\nChesson, who lived in Lahaina all her life, said that the tight-knit community is unlike any other.\n\nShe recalled an experience when she had been grilling outside, and neighbors had seen the smoke and came to check on the family to make sure they didn't have a fire.\n\n\"My husband and I looked at each other and we were like, we can never live anywhere else,\" said Chesson.", "source": {"uri": "mix1027.com", "dataType": "news",

Yet, travelers remain uncertain about visiting Maui, resulting in nearly $1 billion in lost revenue for the Hawaiian island. Historically, tourism has been crucial for Maui, contributing 70% of every dollar to its local economy, as noted by the Maui Economic Development Board.\n\nOfficially, Maui has been open for business since November 1, 2023, excluding the burn zone in Lahaina. However, mixed messages have caused a significant drop in tourist arrivals. In the first half of 2024, Maui saw a 25% decline in visitors, with numbers falling to 1.1 million from nearly 1.5 million in the same period in 2023, according to the state's Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism. This decrease in arrivals led to a drop in spending from $3.47 billion in the first half of 2023 to $2.64 billion in the first half of 2024.\n\nDespite these challenges, Maui now offers a unique opportunity for travelers. The island boasts empty beaches, pristine hotels, and locals who are eager to welcome visitors back. It's an ideal time to experience the island's natural beauty and vibrant culture without the usual crowds.\n\nMaui, with its stunning landscapes and warm hospitality, remains a top travel destination despite the setbacks from last year's wildfires.

Grief. Mistrust. Pending doom. Uncertainty.\n\n\"Lately, it's not so much the date itself but the coming toward that date,\" she told USA TODAY of the Maui wildfire anniversary. \"For me, this past month has been a lot more triggering, a lot more emotional.\"\n\nTo I'i and her family, Lahaina is their home - it has been and will be. She and her family have spent the past year navigating chaos and adjusting to a new normal following the wildfires. After their three-bedroom house burned down, the family were housed in a hotel then moved into a small studio on her great-aunt's property in Lahaina.\n\nI'i said she feels blessed to still live in her hometown, even if it's in the trauma-laced burn zone. Her home will be rebuilt by Habitat for Humanity, but she said not everyone else is so lucky.\n\nMaui is still grieving. Here's how travelers can help.\n\nHer parents, who are retired, also lost their house in what was the deadliest wildfire in recent U.S. history and will have to move to a different island, Oahu. Now they must pay rent after after making mortgage payments. When they can return to Maui is up in the air for now.\n\n\"Everybody's lifestyle has changed,\" she said. \"My parents are going through a time where they worked their whole lives for their home, the home burned and where do you go from there?\"\n\nI'i and her family are not alone in their feelings. Thursday marks the anniversary of the wildfires that ravaged historic Lahaina Town, which killed over 100 people and destroyed homes, cultural sites, and businesses alike. As the Lahaina community continues to work toward recovery - both emotionally and logistically - many questions remain unanswered.\n\nStruggling financially alongside the emotional burden, nearly half of the fire survivors have said they are \"very seriously\" or \"somewhat seriously\" thinking about leaving the island. Research from the Maui Together Wildfire Assessment found that one-third of the family members of survivors have already left.\n\nThe anniversary also serves as a reminder of the deep love and sense of community that Lahaina residents have for their town, the former capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom. This is where many find hope at the chance to rebuild their home, refusing to give up on a new, brighter future for Lahaina, even if it will be years down the line.\n\n\"I love Lahaina so much,\" I'i said. \"That's it for me.\"\n\n'A phoenix from the ashes': How the landmark tree is faring a year after Maui wildfire\n\nBaby Beach was once a beloved local spot in Lahaina, a place where \"everybody would go\" to play in its gentle waters and relax on the sand, according to I'i. Now, I'i thinks of loss when she sees the beach, of the people who had to jump over the rock wall to escape the inferno. \"You see that and it's that heavy feeling,\" she said. \"I think of things such as pilina, or connectedness, our beaches being full of people, and it's really hard to move on.\"\n\nI'i misses running into her neighbors in the grocery store. \"You lost the community, not just losing your home,\" she said. \"Being away from each other has been the biggest loss.\"\n\nDespite how sprawling Maui is - the second-largest island in Hawaii - its community is close-knit.\n\nIn the face of a challenging year, the Maui community has shown remarkable resilience, with grassroots organizations like Lahaina Strong, local restaurants, and citizens stepping up to provide disaster relief when they felt government support fell short.\n\nSince the fires, I'i has been heavily involved in community meetings and mental health outreach. In the immediate aftermath, she went from hotel to hotel to check on those who were displaced to let them know of resources to help them cope with the grief. Sometimes they just talked about what they went through to \"have that shared experience,\" she said. Speaking with another local rather than emergency responders who arrived on the island, people were \"way more open.\"\n\nNow she is working with the Department of Health to establish the Ke Ola Hou Resiliency Center which will serve as a space for the Lahaina community to get mental and physical health and other social services. It's a critical resource as 64% of those impacted by the fires said their mental health has worsened, according to a recent assessment of over 1,000 fire survivors by the Hawaii State Rural Health Association.\n\n\"Being involved, being able to help other people really helps me,\" she said. \"I get to see people in my community. It's familiar, it's hopeful.\"\n\nSurviving the inferno: How the Maui fire reshaped one family's story\n\nBefore the tragedy, life in Maui wasn't only paradise. The island was already facing challenges such as a high cost of living and a housing crisis. In 2021, Maui had the most expensive median rent in the state, according to the 2023 Hawaii Housing Factbook. Housing affordability has been equally difficult for Maui locals, with the median single-family home costing $1 million.\n\nThe devastating fires only exacerbated these concerns for those impacted by the fires, according to the Hawaii State Rural Health Association's assessment. Sixty-nine percent say they're now worse off financially, cutting back on groceries and medical insurance. On Friday, Maui County expanded its Homeowner Assistance Fund on Friday to a total of $21 million for owners to receive up to $60,000 for housing-related expenses like mortgage payments.\n\nOn Maui, short-term rentals account for 15% of the total housing supply, a number that Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen wants to reduce. In May, he proposed a bill to convert over 7,000 of those into long-term rentals by 2026 - approximately 2,200 are in West Maui.\n\n\"Some of the problems as a business operator is we can't hire help because there's no places to live,\" said Peter Merriman, owner of Merriman's Kapalua, just north of Lahaina. \"Everybody who works there has to commute from other parts of the island.\"\n\nMost families are living in limbo due to lengthy insurance processes and awaiting payments from the recent $4 billion settlement agreement from the lawsuit against Hawaiian Electric, which some say was responsible for the fire.\n\nPeter Longhi is also grieving the loss of his family home. \"I didn't lose where we were living but I lost everything from my childhood,\" he said. \"It's just gone, it's really sad.\" He's not quite sure yet if he'll be able to rebuild his house. \"We're planning to, we're hoping to.\"\n\nLonghi inherited Longhi's, a namesake Italian restaurant located on Kaanapali Beach in the Marriott Ocean Club, from his father. Many of his employees lost their homes and had been living in the hotels. \"Dealing with that emotionally, it's been terrible,\" he said. \"Coming up on a year, it still gets you at random times.\"\n\nFor Longhi, the hardest part of recovery is the uncertainty. What will become of Front Street, once the most patronized part of Maui? Will there be enough jobs or housing in the rebuilding of Lahaina? How much will it cost to rebuild his home?\n\n\"Nobody knows the answer, and that's what I think is frustrating and saddening to everybody is just not knowing,\" he said.\n\nOne year later, there are rays of hope.\n\n\u25fe Banana trees are sprouting, offering specks of vibrant green life among the ashes.\n\nMany look toward the past to inform Lahaina's future - the town was built upon a wetland called Moku'ula and a royal fishpond known as Mokuhinia. It was once so abundant it was called the \"Venice of the Pacific.\" Breadfruit trees and others were planted around the sacred resource, offering shade and food. Freed from infrastructure and given the space and time to breathe, the groundwater and streams have begun to reflow.\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green and other officials are coordinating with Native Hawaiian-led Lahaina nonprofits like Na Aikane o Maui to restore the cultural site. This regeneration offers renewed strength to Lahaina residents.\n\n\"I never thought it would happen in my lifetime,\" I'i said. \"Instead of having a bunch of tourist drops on Front Street and catering to tourism, I hope there is cultural preservation from the beginning of Moku'ula.\"\n\nRebuilding Lahaina not only offers an opportunity to honor its cultural history but also reshape the town with improved, more resilient infrastructure. As the deadly flames raged, many people were unable to get out because of downed power lines and locked gates, according to a recent report, commissioned by the Hawaii attorney general and published by the Fire Safety Research Institute. Failed pipes meant water couldn't flow from the fire hydrants.\n\nUnfortunately, rebuilding the town will take years, with some architects estimating seven to eight years. Heartbreakingly, some of the kupuna (elders) may not see their revitalized Lahaina.\n\nStill, construction is already underway for a handful of Lahaina homes and more permits are applied for each day. New houses are slated to be outfitted with roofing and other materials to better withstand high winds and wildfires. It will be a long way to go, but those who call Lahaina home push forward.\n\n\"I don't want to just survive here, I want to be able to thrive here,\" I'i said.\n\nKathleen Wong is a travel reporter based in Hawaii.

The estimated cost to rebuild exceeds $5.5 billion.\n\nSeparate fires that same day in Kula and Olinda in Upcountry Maui burned nearly two dozen homes.\n\nHCF reported Friday that its Maui Strong Fund raised $195 million from over 240,000 people across 78 countries and more than 5,000 corporations. The total includes approximately $5 million in interest.\n\nHCF President Micah Kane told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser the foundation follows a rigorous process to ensure the integrity of the organizations seeking funds, carefully verifying that the money is distributed to the appropriate organizations, people and communities in need.\n\nAs of July 19, $109.4 million from the Maui Strong Fund had been awarded to 196 grantee partners, with additional grant making ongoing.\n\nOf that total, $25.1 million was granted to eight partners who issued over 12,000 payments to Maui fire survivors for immediate needs such as food, gas, rent, mortgage payments, utilities and other essentials.\n\nOne of the largest grants was awarded to Maui United Way, which received $5 million to support its Emergency Financial Assistance program, which delivered $1,000 in cash to adults in the fire-affected zones via digital payments through Venmo, PayPal, direct deposits or pre-paid Visa cards.\n\nThe support from the Maui Strong Fund enabled Maui United Way to allocate $5 million to assist 5,000 residents, according to HCF.\n\nThe foundation said the $109.4 million awarded as of July 19 was distributed across four key sectors: economic resilience, health and social services systems, housing and natural, historical and cultural resources.\n\nThe Maui Interim Housing Plan received the largest amount, over $50 million.\n\nCombined with contributions from partners such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which committed $250 million, the state of Hawai'i, which committed $150 million, Maui County, which committed $40 million, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, which contributed $5 million, and additional philanthropic donations totaling $5 million, the total commitment to the Maui Interim Housing Plan reached $500 million.\n\nThe initiative aims to create more than 3,000 stable housing units for households displaced by the fires.\n\nOf the $50 million allocated to the plan by HCF, about $10 million was directed to CNHA to create 68 accessory dwelling units for wildfire survivors. The remaining $40 million was awarded to HomeAid Hawai'i, which is using the funds to purchase 450 temporary housing units for development in West Maui through a project called Ka La'i Ola.\n\n\"The Maui Strong Fund has been critical to Maui's recovery in the past year, and will continue to be in the coming years as we look to the community's vision for a stronger, more resilient Maui,\" Gov. Josh Green said in a statement. \"I appreciate HCF's leadership and its continued commitment to addressing affordable housing as a priority for the entire Maui community.\"\n\nKane told the Star-\u00adAdvertiser that the Maui Strong Fund -- alongside similar funds for Hawai'i's other three major counties -- was established in 2018 to efficiently mobilize support for disaster relief and recovery.\n\nOn Aug. 9, just hours after the fires, HCF activated the Maui fund. The initial funding of a couple hundred thousand dollars quickly ballooned as the tragedy's magnitude became evident.\n\nKane said HCF responded in a similar manner to the Kauai floods in 2018, the Lower Puna eruption that same year and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020; however, those fundraising efforts were dwarfed by the response to the Maui fires.\n\nThe approximately $85 million remaining in the Maui Strong Fund will continue to be dispersed as the fund stays active, he said, noting that as federal and state resources begin to expire, the community will need ongoing support.\n\nHCF is in Phase 3 of its Maui Strong Fund disaster response, which includes interventions and programs aimed at strengthening Maui's economy and communities while supporting organizations that engage with families.\n\nPhase 3 could take years to complete and could end up utilizing 70 percent to 85 percent of the total amount raised by the fund.\n\nPhase 1 involved pre-\u00addisaster planning to enhance the community's ability to respond quickly, and Phase 2 addressed immediate needs such as shelter and cash assistance.\n\nThe final phase will focus on long-term rebuilding efforts, including implementation of regional develop\u00adment plans that prioritize each community's sense of place, HCF said.", "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Garden

A community plagued by a housing crisis and power struggles with the tourism industry were among the issues tested in the aftermath of the wildfire.\n\nThere has been much progress in the year since the fires, and yet a lot remains to be done, according to community leaders who have witnessed the transformation in West Maui. The emotional scars are especially raw, and affordable housing within and surrounding the burn zone remains a central issue, Maui County council member Keani Rawlins-Fernandez told ABC News.\n\nMaui - and the Hawaiian Islands as a whole - have been facing a housing crisis that predates the wildfire tragedy. The destruction highlighted the state's ongoing struggles with high housing costs, lack of affordable housing options, and low wages.\n\nThese are the major developments in West Maui in the year since the wildfires:\n\nWest Maui reopened for tourism on Oct. 8, just two months after the outbreak of the wildfires. The decision was considered controversial, with business owners calling for economic relief and a return to normalcy and residents insisting they needed more time to heal and recover.\n\nThe initial reopening entailed that Lahaina would remain closed to the public, but the decision still sparked outrage from some members in the community, thousands of whom remained displaced and were taking up refuge at West Maui hotels, ABC News previously reported. Many had not yet been allowed back to the burn sites to survey the damage of their homes and feared that they would be kicked out of hotels to allow paying customers to stay in their place, community members told ABC News.\n\nTourism in West Maui opened before survivors of the fire were able to secure housing -- exacerbating an affordable housing crisis that existed long before the fires, said Rawlins-Fernandez. Rent prices for vacation rentals rose astronomically as a result of the reopening, and at least 1,400 people have left Maui in the past year, she added.\n\nDays before the reopening for tourism, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green stated that while he was sympathetic to those who were not ready for visitors to return, Maui and the state needed the money that the tourists bring. The number of visitors to Maui plummeted by 70% following the fires, The Associated Press reported in September.\n\n\"\"On October 8, 2023, we welcomed the return of visitors to West Maui to support Maui's economy and keep our people employed so they can continue to live on Maui and recover,\" Green said in an emailed statement to ABC News. \"We continue to encourage respectful travel, supporting local businesses and participation in volunteer opportunities that m\u0101lama (give back to) Hawai'i. With targeted efforts and campaigns showcasing Maui's readiness to welcome visitors, we are committed to supporting the state and Maui's economic recovery and hope to see continuous improvements over the upcoming months.\"\n\nIn Maui, 70% of every dollar is generated directly or indirectly by the visitor industry, according to the Maui Economic Development Board.\n\nBut the community rallied, and locals groups continue to work tirelessly to find affordable housing for residents -- a project that will undoubtedly be long-term, Rawlins-Fernandez said.\n\nBy December, some of the most iconic locations in West Maui began to reopen.\n\nPlaces like Banyan Tree Park, the Lahaina public library and the opening of an elementary school marked positive milestones as the arduous cleanup and recovery process continued.\n\nBut just four months before, such swift progress may have seemed unthinkable.\n\nWhen the fires broke out, Timothy Griffin, the County of Maui arborist who cares for the historic banyan tree, said he heard through \"coconut wireless,\" the island's unofficial phone tree in which information spreads like wildfire, that the 150-year-old tree that often serves as the symbol of Lahaina had been destroyed to ash.\n\nDrone footage that showed browned and curled leaves still attached to the tree proved the rumor mill very wrong, a good indicator that it wasn't completely burned and charred, Griffin said.\n\n\"I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a pile of ash,\" he said.\n\nThe tree was protected by its surroundings. The fire stayed high, flashing over the top of the canopy toward the old courthouse on the other side of the park -- the walls of which are made of thick concrete, preventing the fire from roaring back at a lower level and destroying the trunk, Griffin said.\n\nThe beloved tree was heavily damaged, but by September it started to show signs of growth.\n\nThe recovery that arborists expected to see in three months happened in three weeks, a stark sign that the famous banyan tree would survive and thrive, Griffin said. About 40% of the tree was lost, so the dead wood has been removed, and the tree will undergo a form of \"reconstructive surgery\" over the next 10 to 20 years to guide and prune the new growth to become a new canopy.\n\nThe reopening of Bayan Tree Park, well as the library and schools, can seem like hollow celebrations when Maui residents still don't have a place to live, Rawlins-Fernandez said. But watching the children of West Maui rise up from the tragedy has brought the community the most hope and joy in the past year, he added.\n\nEvents like school plays and high school football games have provided the community with a forum for normalcy -- especially in a time when students are still being bussed into their campuses from all over the island, where housing is more available, a stark reminder of the work left to be done, Rawlins-Fernandez said.\n\nOnce the fires were contained, it became immediately clear that the environmental impact would last for years to come. Debris and toxic chemicals, much of it byproduct from coming into contact with the inferno, littered West Maui.\n\nOne year after the fire, cleanup efforts have surpassed what many federal, state and local agencies thought were possible during the time frame, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Col. Eric Swenson told ABC News.\n\nAs a result of the fires, the power grid was destroyed; water service interrupted; entire neighborhoods destroyed; and a seemingly never-ending pile of debris to dispose of from a small island.\n\nBut the workers, many of whom live in West Maui, worked diligently. By late July, nearly all of the 1,399 homes in Lahaina had been removed, with dozens being built in Lahaina and Kula, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen told Hawaii News Now. Water is expected to be restored to Lahaina by August and wastewater by January, Bissen said, adding that all projects are ahead of schedule.\n\nSwenson believes the participation by locals fueled the recovery efforts -- power, water, sewer, debris and housing.\n\n\"There was an awful lot of people from the community who are invested in the success of this recovery operation, and that allowed us to go faster than probably any other recovery effort that we've undertaken,\" he said.\n\nResidential debris removal is expected to be done by January and commercial debris removal by February, Swenson said.\n\nThe biggest long-term development in the year since the wildfires regarding Hawaii's housing crisis may be a bill signed into law by Hawaii Gov. Josh Green that gives counties more authority to regulate short-term vacation rentals.\n\nIn West Maui, almost half of all dwellings were used solely as short-term vacation rentals to be rented out to tourists, according to state officials.\n\n\"We know the majority of STRs in Hawai'i are illegal, owned by non-residents, and contribute to skyrocketing housing costs,\" Green said in a post on X at the time.\n\nAs Maui County also phases out short-term rentals, hundreds of families impacted by the wildfire continue to utilize rental assistance, mortgage assistance, and temporary housing backed by federal, state, and local agencies.\n\nIn April, a collaborative effort between the state, Maui County, Hawai'i Community Foundation, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement and others announced 50 two-bedroom homes to be given to displaced families with donated furniture.\n\nIn June, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands awarded 52 turnkey homes -- homes that don't require major repairs or improvements -- to Native Hawaiian residents in Waikap\u016b, Maui, with prices between $509,800 to $699,000.\n\nThe department plans to award 137 turnkey homes total and 24 improved vacant lots in the region.\n\n\"The department will persistently seek out lands in areas we can establish secure and resilient communities for those we serve,\" Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Director Kali Watson told ABC News. \"The people of Maui have faced numerous challenges since the wildfires. We hope these homes will inspire and uplift a community recovering from a devastating tragedy.\"\n\nFEMA has also leased residential properties for more than 1,200 households who needed temporary housing for either 18 months or until February 2025.\n\nThe agency says it plans to complete Kilohana, a group housing site expected to contain 169 units for eligible survivors to use for temporary housing, by October 2024.\n\nThe news of longer term housing comes as the state concludes its Non-Congregate Sheltering program, which provided shelter and assistance to 7,796 individuals and 3,071 households displaced by the Lahaina wildfires,.\n\nEmergency assistance programs from federal and state programs have continued to play a role in supporting affected residents in the months following the tragedy.\n\nBut now, residents say support from the community on Maui and beyond lending a helping hand has been a major source of stability.\n\nOne group called Help Maui Rise says it disperses 100% of donated funds directly to families without any administrative or processing fees.\n\n\"We would get messages from people just thanking us for $100 and it was really heartbreaking because it seems like so little ... We realized that $100 could mean dinner, it could mean groceries, it could mean baby formula, it's stuff that you just assume they have the money for,\" Kenna Reed, co-founder of Help Maui Rise, told ABC News.\n\nMaui residents who lost everything in the island's wildfires say they have forgotten what normal life felt like before the tragedy. Community-born programs like Help Maui Rise have not only offered financial support but also emotional support, they say.\n\nAfter the fires, Lahaina resident Dusty Renan says he stepped down from his role managing a company he had held for 18 years.\n\nHe told ABC News that the stress, anxiety and depression he faced in the months after losing his family's apartment and all their belongings made the break a necessity for his health and family.\n\nAccessing funding from larger organizations has proven difficult, he says, with Renan getting rejected or fighting through red tape to get assistance for his family. That's when community-backed organizations stepped in.\n\n\"We made it through thanks to resources and people - it's the people that really made a difference in all of this. And it was the people that kind of gave us hope and kind of helped us to move forward,\" said Renan.\n\nHe added, \"I just want Lahaina back, I want Lahaina to be strong.\"\n\nZoe Chesson, a mother with two young children, told ABC News that her family stayed with friends and relatives immediately after the wildfires destroyed their home, but eventually had to move off Maui to the Island of Hawaii, or the Big Island, following the tragedy.\n\n\"Everything is starting completely from scratch,\" Chesson told ABC News. \"It's been kind of a journey.\"\n\nChesson, who lived in Lahaina all her life, said that the tight-knit community is unlike any other.\n\nShe recalled an experience when she had been grilling outside, and neighbors had seen the smoke and came to check on the family to make sure they didn't have a fire.\n\n\"My husband and I looked at each other and we were like, we can never live anywhere else,\" said Chesson.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType":

Log in now to continue reading.\n\nA Maui tradesman turned his passion for metal work into a 16-foot-tall, tear-shaped sculpture that he unveiled Wednesday night above the Lahaina burn zone on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the devastating wildfires.\n\nSoakai Taufa, 63, works as a carpenter, mason and in other trades around Maui. \"I'm an all-around guy,\" he said.\n\nTaufa spent nearly three months and $6,000 of his own money on rebar, screws, poles, paint, Christmas lights and other material to zip-tie everything into a piece of art that to him symbolizes the tears of Maui in the wake of the wildfires that killed 102 people, with two still considered missing. About 3,500 homes in Lahaina were destroyed, along with about 20 in Upcountry Maui in gale-force winds from a passing storm.\n\nThe Lahaina wildfire is among the worst natural disasters in Hawaii, which has seen tragedy from tsunamis, hurricanes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nTo honor the dead, Taufa erected his work and unveiled it off of Lahainaluna Road, where he also set up flags and a makeshift memorial that drivers can see as they travel along Lahaina Bypass Road, the main road in and out of Lahaina.\n\n\"I spent quite a bit, but that's what I wanted to do, so it's OK,\" Taufa said.\n\nThe area around the artwork is marked with signs calling the area the \"Tear Drop of Lahaina,\" \"May The Souls Of Our Town Rest In Peace\" and warning visitors to be respectful.\n\nToday will be marked in a number of commemorations, and statements on the anniversary of the tragedy began to come in on Wednesday.\n\n\"One year later, our hearts remain heavy as we remember the lives lost, the families impacted, and the communities affected by the devastating Aug. 8 wildfires,\" Speaker Scott Saiki, (D, Ala Moana-KakaakoDowntown), said on behalf of the state House. \"The House stands committed to supporting ongoing recovery efforts for our Maui 'ohana, and our shared dedication to prioritizing the needs of Maui residents remains unwavering.\"\n\nRep. Kyle Yamashita, (D, Pukalani-Makawao- Ulupalakua), said: \"From the Aug. 8 tragedy, one truth has emerged: our Maui community is resilient and strong. We are deeply grateful to our state, county, and federal partners for their steadfast support throughout this past year. As we continue wildfire recovery efforts, we know there is much more work to be continued. Prioritizing the rehabilitation of our communities, restoring shelter for local families, providing economic support, ensuring safe drinking water, and addressing the mental health needs of our communities is imperative.\"\n\nMaui's state Sens. Lynn DeCoite, (D, East and Upcountry Maui-MolokaiLanai), Angus McKelvey, (D, West Maui-Maalaea-South Maui), and Troy Hashimoto, (D, WailukuKahuluiWaihee), issued a joint statement.\n\n\"Maui has always been a community of aloha, resilience, and hope and as we look back on the tragedies that occurred on August 8, 2023, we see this reflected in the people of Maui. Each and every life lost and survived has a story and a memory. As we continue to heal and move towards rebuilding, we remain committed to each other and to our communities.\n\n\"Mahalo to the State, the County of Maui, community leaders, volunteers, and our neighbors for coming together in our time of need. While there is much to be done in our long journey to recovery, we see a road ahead full of hope and promise.

How to visit Maui now", "body": "On August 8, 2023, an out-of-control wildfire fueled by winds from Hurricane Dora ripped through the town of Lahaina on Maui's west coast.\n\nUa Aloha Maji, a lifelong Lahaina resident, was at his house in Lahainaluna, about a mile inland of the town center when the fire began.\n\nFrom his perch on the hillside, he watched in disbelief as the flames set off small explosions and devoured houses and cars, taking with them many of his friends, community members and childhood memories.\n\n\"I grew up in Lahaina; I've been here my whole life,\" Maji said. \"I was trying to hold it all together.\"\n\nMaji did what he could to help those around him. With the power out, he went house-to-house with a generator, cycling to neighbors' refrigerators to keep their food fresh as well as to charge phones and power medical devices.\n\nBut there was nothing he could do to save Lahaina. The fast-moving fire took the lives of at least 100 people and destroyed more than 2,200 structures, including homes, apartments and historical buildings.\n\nIn a relative blink of an eye, Lahaina, one of the most historic towns in Hawai'i, was gone.\n\nWhat followed were days, weeks and months of community organization and support. In the past year, hotels in West Maui have housed more than 7,000 displaced residents. Grassroots organizations - official and unofficial - have done countless hours of selfless work.\n\nMaji said there were three community hubs in his neighborhood alone.\n\n\"Everyone really stepped up and helped each other on a level we haven't seen before,\" Maji said. \"This was an elevated sharing of k\u014dkua,\" the Hawaiian concept of \"help\" or selfless giving.\n\nYet a year later, long-term stability for Maui remains elusive. Despite challenging times and some complicated feelings, the island is urging visitors to come back and be a part of the recovery as residents and businesses continue to struggle economically.\n\n\"The immediate task before us is clear: Let visitors know that it's a great time to return and rediscover the island of Maui,\" said Ilihia Gionson, public affairs officer for the Hawai'i Tourism Authority.\n\nChallenging times: Can tourism help?\n\nPeople gather along Kaanapali Beach on August 5, 2024, near Lahaina. In the first half of 2024, Maui saw a 23.8% decrease in visitor arrivals from the same period last year. That's slowing down the economic recovery on the island.\n\nMario Tama/Getty Images\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the fire, tourism to the entire island was suspended for about two weeks so that resources could be dedicated to the recovery effort. West Maui remained closed to visitors until November.\n\nAt that time, tourists were asked to return to the island, but it was a soft sell, because thousands of displaced residents were still living in hotel rooms.\n\nIn recent months, the Hawai\u02bbi Tourism Authority (HTA) has begun to restress the importance of welcoming and encouraging visitors as part of the larger recovery effort.\n\n\"Our aim is to ensure that residents have the jobs and financial opportunities to heal and thrive,\" said Mufi Hannemann, HTA Board Chair. \"Job and financial security are directly tied to housing and food security, which are vital to physical and psychological recovery. It's our sincere hope to restore a sense of security and normalcy to Maui residents after they've faced such extreme loss and uncertainty.\"\n\nThe impacts of the economic downturn were highlighted last month in a study conducted by the Hawai\u02bbi State Rural Health Association. It found that a significant number of Maui County residents are suffering from mental health issues and financial strain. Many are thinking about leaving the island because of the poor economic conditions after the fire.\n\nMaji said he knows many people who fit this description. Economically, he said he saw his cost-of-living expenses go up by $1,500 a month in the wake of the fire, with his bills now totaling $4,000 a month.\n\n\"And that's on the low end of what people are paying [in housing costs and bills],\" Maji said.\n\nIn March, the HTA launched a recovery campaign called \"M\u0101kaukau Maui,\" which means \"Maui is Ready.\" The idea was to help revitalize Maui's economy, get people back to work and signal to potential visitors that they are welcome.\n\nBut so far, visitors haven't got the message in the numbers the island needs, and the economy remains behind.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Maui saw a 23.8% decrease in visitor arrivals from the same period last year, and a 24% drop in visitor spending. The average number of daily visitors on Maui was down 22% in June 2024 when compared with June 2023.\n\nDon Prestage, president of Sail Maui, said that two of his boats were moored off Lahaina Harbor the day of the fire but were far enough offshore to avoid damage. Still, the fires and subsequent downturn in tourism has had a significant effect on the company, including a full halt of business in the weeks after the fire and then the logistics of moving their operations from Lahaina to Ma'alaea, which took several months to arrange permitting.\n\nHe said the worst part has been watching some of his employees leave Maui because of the economic downturn.\n\n\"That's been one of the harder things to see,\" Prestage said. \"People that haven't been able to stay in the community - people left [Maui] because they couldn't work.\"\n\nComplicated feelings\n\nAn aerial view on August 4, 2024, of Maria Lanakila Catholic Church, which was spared by the wildfire. How to rebuild Lahaina best is a question on the minds of many residents.\n\nMario Tama/Getty Images\n\nThe recovery of tourism was slow and difficult in the beginning because of the immensity of the devastation. Now, the recovery is still slow and difficult, and there's no singular explanation for why.\n\nBut one reason might be that complicated feelings about the appropriate time to engage in carefree leisure activities as the local population struggles to rebuild are getting passed on to potential visitors.\n\nPrestage said many of his customers at Sail Maui over the past year have expressed that they were hesitant to visit Maui because they weren't sure whehter it was appropriate to come and have fun, especially in the early days when thousands of residents still lived in hotels.\n\nProtests back in the fall also undoubtedly shaped public opinion, although those protests were more about the housing crisis than being anti-tourist.\n\n\"People I talk to say, 'We were nervous to come and afraid we weren't welcome or wanted,' \" Prestage said.\n\nMaui residents have had the tough task of balancing the local recovery effort and ongoing housing crisis with the economic recovery effort for the island as a whole. Prestage said that business owners \"are in the awkward position of having to move on more quickly\" than most.\n\n\"We need to be respectful for so much devastation and loss,\" Prestage said. \"But on the other hand, people need to work, and there are people supporting other family members on the island.\"\n\nHe said people should remember that most visitors are respectful and come because they truly love Maui.\n\nBen Shank, general manager of the Four Seasons Resort in Wailea, said that Maui's initial message asking tourists not to come immediately after the fire was appropriate but \"has managed to stick around,\" hurting the economy and continuing the residual impact of the fire.\n\nMaking sure visitors know they are welcome back to the island is crucial to improving the economic situation, which is \"key to how the island thrives,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously, there are people who have been dramatically affected, but there's also a huge population of folks who help take care of one another,\" Shank said. \"By supporting the island and having people come and enjoy it, that fuels the entire island.\"\n\nHow to visit Maui\n\nA visitor walks by photos of victims of the August 2023 wildfire at a memorial near the Lahaina Bypass highway on July 6, 2024. Tourists are grappling with how to respectfully visit the area where so much devastation and loss occurred just one year earlier.\n\nLindsey Wasson/AP\n\nMaji is ready to welcome back visitors.\n\nAs a cultural practitioner for the local nonprofit Kipuka Olowalu and a gigging local musician, he enjoys sharing his homeland with visitors and believes they should be welcomed in the \"old Hawaiian way.\"\n\n\"In Lahaina, our elders were always graceful,\" he said. \"They had empathy and love for perfect strangers, and they never judged them.\"\n\nWhen visiting, Maji advises against staying at an Airbnb or vacation rental at this time because of the ongoing housing crisis. (Many vacation rentals have been converted to long-term housing for displaced residents, with more changes possibly on the way).\n\nInstead, he recommends staying at one of the many beautiful Maui hotels that employ locals, and to seek out small shops and restaurants.\n\n\"Don't just stay at an Airbnb and shop for groceries at Walmart,\" he said. \"Come out and see us.\"\n\nWhen visiting establishments and meeting local people, Maji said not to pry about the fire.\n\n\"If someone wants to talk, they will,\" he said. \"A lot of people are really traumatized, so don't ask, and don't stick your finger in the wound. Don't demand to know what a person's experience was.\"\n\nWhen choosing activities, Ashley Roussel, sales manager at Sail Maui, said visitors should seek out local companies who are promoting Hawaiian values in their programming, prioritizing environmental awareness, using local catering and instilling a \"sense of place\" in their employees and clientele.\n\nVisitors should not be afraid to vet companies before giving them their money.\n\n\"I think there's an opportunity for visitors to be selective about the way they participate with providers here,\" Roussel said. \"Choose vendors that show an extra layer of mindfulness of the cultural environment.\"\n\nIf you want to take things a step further and take direct action in the local communities, the HTA has ongoing volunteer programs that can also earn you discounts on your stay. Many hotels also offer such packages. Be sure to inquire when booking.\n\nFor love of Lahaina\n\nIn a sign of renewal and hope, fresh leaves grow on the beloved banyan tree in front of the remains of the Old Lahaina Courthouse, built in 1859.\n\nMario Tama/Getty Images\n\nAlong with residential homes, most of the historic district of Lahaina, including Front Street, was destroyed by the August 8th wildfire.\n\nThe rebuild and future of this area is still being discussed. Some have proposed rebuilding as it was; others have suggested a complete change to protect it from rising sea levels and to restore some of its original, native landscape and Hawaiian cultural sites.\n\nRebuilding the historic district could be done in a variety of ways because of the many lives Lahaina has lived.\n\nOriginally called Lele and known for its abundance of breadfruit (ulu) trees, the area didn't begin going by Lahaina until the 17th or 18th century.\n\nThe name Lahaina translates to \"cruel sun.\" In the Hawaiian language, place names are used to describe the conditions and personality of an area, so one could know what to expect before arriving.\n\nLahaina served as the royal capital of Hawai'i from 1802 to 1845 before it was moved to Honolulu on O'ahu.\n\nDuring this time, Lahaina was also a busy port, providing a place of refuge for international ships exploring the world's largest ocean. It was also the epicenter for the Pacific whaling industry.\n\nIn 1820, the missionaries arrived and took up a presence in Lahaina. The Baldwin Home, built in 1834 and referred to as the \"missionary compound,\" was Maui's oldest home before it burned down in the wildfire.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Lahaina became a plantation town during the sugarcane era. The Pioneer Mill Co. smokestack, established in 1860, was one of the few historic landmarks to survive the fire.\n\nMore recently, Lahaina became a hub of activity and tourism, with restaurants, shops and tour operators.\n\nAlmost everything in this area has been destroyed. But one thing that still remains is Lahaina's famous banyan tree, which was planted in 1873. It was badly damaged in the fire but has shown signs of life in the past year.\n\nThe spelling of the place name Lahaina was the subject of a recent public discussion. Previously, you may have seen it spelled L\u0101hain\u0101, but language experts now say that Lahaina is the proper way of spelling it, according to historical records.\n\nLahaina is beloved by many who have visited Maui, but most of all by its local population. Maji said he sends his gratitude to all who have helped his community in the past year.\n\n\"Every single person that helped, I thank them personally and am grateful for them,\" he said.", "source":

With the power out, he went house-to-house with a generator, cycling to neighbors' refrigerators to keep their food fresh as well as to charge phones and power medical devices.\n\nBut there was nothing he could do to save Lahaina. The fast-moving fire took the lives of at least 100 people and destroyed more than 2,200 structures, including homes, apartments and historical buildings.\n\nIn a relative blink of an eye, Lahaina, one of the most historic towns in Hawai'i, was gone.\n\nWhat followed were days, weeks and months of community organization and support. In the past year, hotels in West Maui have housed more than 7,000 displaced residents. Grassroots organizations - official and unofficial - have done countless hours of selfless work.\n\nMaji said there were three community hubs in his neighborhood alone.\n\n\"Everyone really stepped up and helped each other on a level we haven't seen before,\" Maji said. \"This was an elevated sharing of k\u014dkua,\" the Hawaiian concept of \"help\" or selfless giving.\n\nYet a year later, long-term stability for Maui remains elusive. Despite challenging times and some complicated feelings, the island is urging visitors to come back and be a part of the recovery as residents and businesses continue to struggle economically.\n\n\"The immediate task before us is clear: Let visitors know that it's a great time to return and rediscover the island of Maui,\" said Ilihia Gionson, public affairs officer for the Hawai'i Tourism Authority.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the fire, tourism to the entire island was suspended for about two weeks so that resources could be dedicated to the recovery effort. West Maui remained closed to visitors until November.\n\nAt that time, tourists were asked to return to the island, but it was a soft sell, because thousands of displaced residents were still living in hotel rooms.\n\nIn recent months, the Hawai\u02bbi Tourism Authority (HTA) has begun to restress the importance of welcoming and encouraging visitors as part of the larger recovery effort.\n\n\"Our aim is to ensure that residents have the jobs and financial opportunities to heal and thrive,\" said Mufi Hannemann, HTA Board Chair. \"Job and financial security are directly tied to housing and food security, which are vital to physical and psychological recovery. It's our sincere hope to restore a sense of security and normalcy to Maui residents after they've faced such extreme loss and uncertainty.\"\n\nThe impacts of the economic downturn were highlighted last month in a study conducted by the Hawai\u02bbi State Rural Health Association.

And That's Causing A Lot Of Problems", "body": "Efforts to boost the industry will focus on key Southern California markets, with additional pushes targeting corporate meeting and incentive planners.\n\nGovernment officials and tourism executives are seeking to restore tourism to Maui, a year after wildfires destroyed much of the island's Lahaina tourism hub and battered the its key industry.\n\nJust a year ago residents rallied to implore tourists to stay away from West Maui and let residents grieve and recover.\n\nNow officials are planning to target travelers from Southern California - Maui's most important market - with a campaign designed to restore what tourism executives say is critically needed business for the island's economy.\n\nVisitor numbers and spending remain sluggish since the August 2023 wildfires. According to the most recent available data from the Hawaii Tourism Authority, for June, the number of visitors to Maui was down 22% compared with June 2023. Visitor spending was down 27%, HTA reported.\n\nThe 216,065 visitors to Maui in June was far more than the 94,221 who came in September, the month after the fire. But the number is 22% fewer than the 276,136 who came in June 2023. And with the traditionally slow fall travel season on the horizon, the situation soon could get worse.\n\n\"We're clearly seeing tremendous softness on Maui,\" said Jay Talwar, chief marketing officer with the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau. Projections show the softness could remain until March or April of next year, said Talwar, whose organization leads Hawaii's tourism marketing to the U.S. mainland.\n\nThe press to attract travelers is a dramatic departure from the mixed messages prospective visitors received in the weeks and months after the devastating fires, said Mufi Hannemann, chairman of the board that governs the Hawaii Tourism Authority.\n\nInitially, tourists thought they should stay away from Maui, Hannemann recalls. Later they were told to come to Maui but not to West Maui. Then they were told to come, but to be sensitive to what residents were going through, as part of a \"Malama Maui\" campaign.\n\nNow tourism officials are rolling out an unequivocal welcome mat, especially for potential visitors from the Los Angeles area, Hannemann says. The authority is hoping to make mixed messages a thing of the past, he said.\n\n\"We really feel all of that is behind us,\" Hannemann said.\n\nTourism executives on Maui are facing multiple problems as tourism lags.\n\nOne critical issue involves workforce, said Lisa Paulson, executive director of the Maui Hotel and Lodging Association. The island's hotel workforce has declined by 5,600 since the fires, she said. And with housing prices escalating, it's hard to recruit new workers to the island, she said.\n\nThe lack of workers is so bad that some hotels are considering outsourcing certain jobs to third-parties instead of relying on hotel employees, Paulson said. That creates fewer in-house hotel jobs, which drives more people out of the workforce. It's all part of what Paulson describes as a downward vicious spiral.\n\n\"It's like a dog chasing it's tail,\" she said. \"Where does the solution insert itself?\"\n\nAnother vicious spiral involves airline seats to Maui. Airline assets are by definition mobile: if a route isn't popular, airlines can move a smaller plane to serve it or eliminate the service altogether. That means a smaller supply of seats for travelers -- and potentially higher fares for those seats, which affects demand, and so on.\n\n\"The challenge with airlines is their assets are moveable, so they can move their assets where demand is,\" HVCB's Talwar said.\n\nAccording to Paulson, Maui's passenger air capacity is down 16% since before the fires. Much of that involves service to the key Los Angeles market, Talwar said. Losing the LA seats is especially problematic, he said, because LA serves as a gateway to Hawaii, serving travelers from destinations further east as well as those from Southern California.\n\n\"If we lose flights from LA, it's a double whammy,\" he said.\n\nBut regaining air travelers poses a major challenge. Short term, airline bookings for Maui through the end of the year are below levels reported in July 2023, the tourism authority reports. And some softness could remain for years.\n\nA recent Hawaii Tourism Authority study found that over a third of air travelers interviewed in May said the Maui wildfires will impact their likelihood of visiting Hawaii in the next two years. Eight percent said they previously were likely to visit but are \"no longer likely to visit in the next two years due to the fires.\"\n\nIt's not just big businesses like resorts and airlines that are feeling the pinch. For small business owners like Karli Rose Wilson, the drop in visitors has meant a substantial decline in her business. The owner of To Be Organics, Wilson manufactures high-end bath, body and skin care products at a design studio in Wailuku.\n\nWilson normally sells her products wholesale to boutiques, hotels, meeting planners and the like. After the fires, Wilson said, she shut down her factory and and shop for about three weeks and used the space for people to drop off relief supplies. Wilson's husband, a former chef who now works with To Be, volunteered cooking meals for fire survivors.\n\nAfter reopening in September, Wilson pivoted from her business-to-business model to sell more products on line. The holidays and first quarter of 2024 were good for To Be, she says, as people rallied to support small Maui-based businesses.\n\nBut that business has fallen off, and the normal influx of summer tourists hasn't come this year.\n\n\"We're all used to the seasonal fluctuations,\" she said. \"We were waiting for summer to happen at the end of June. But there was nothing. It was crickets. We never really got that summer season.\"\n\nSo instead of a boost to carry To Be into the holiday season, the company has seen a decline of about 25% compared with last year, she said.\n\nThe tourism authority and HVCB's push in Los Angeles harkens back to a similar effort launched after the 2008 financial crisis, Talwar said. The idea is not simply to saturate the market but to use behavioral data to target advertising to potential visitors.\n\nTalwar said the campaign will involve paid social media ads and non-skippable commercials appearing on smart TVs, but he declined to say much more. Hotels will be encouraged to bolster the advertising with their own ads and promotions\n\n\"I don't want to go into too many details because it's a competitive market,\" he said.\n\nThe visitors bureau is also looking to corporate meetings and incentive travel to fill hotel rooms, restaurants and ballrooms. Travel paid for by companies for corporate retreats and as rewards for top performers can be especially lucrative, Talwar said.\n\nAnd it's not just money for rooms and food and beverage.\n\nWith all their travel and lodging expenses paid, pampered corporate travelers often have extra cash for shopping, spas and other activities, Talwar said.\n\n\"We see a much higher spend from them,\" he said.\n\nFor hotels, booking groups in advance enables them to better manage cash flow and staffing.\n\nAnd with team-building exercises often scheduled for corporate meeting and incentive trips, such travelers are likely to engage in the volunteer activities that HTA promotes as part of its Malama Hawaii campaign.\n\nTo secure more such travel for Maui, the HVCB is hosting a trip to Maui in December for decision makers for what Talway described as \"key accounts,\" such as corporations and industry groups. In August 2025, Maui is planning to host some 250 key meeting and incentive planners, Talwar said.\n\nWilson said To Be has benefitted in the past from corporate planners buying her luxury, locally made creams, oils and candles to give away as gifts. So boosting such travel will help her and other small Maui businesses that rely on tourists.\n\nAsked whether she and her peers can survive until the new initiatives gain traction, Wilson expressed optimism.\n\n\"On Maui, I feel like we're resilient. We're a strong community,\" she said. \"As entrepreneurs, this is part of the journey -- to overcome these obstacles, no matter what form they come in. And the festive season is right around the corner.\"", "source": {"uri": "civilbeat.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Civil Beat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stewart_yerton@civilbeat.org", "name": "Stewart Yerton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mufi_Hannemann", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mufi Hannemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talwar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Talwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Maui_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Maui Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_marketing_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief marketing officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greater Los Angeles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wholesaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Candle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(insect)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket (insect)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas and holiday season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wailuku,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wailuku, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wailuku, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Consolidators", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Consolidators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2022/10/28093906/Kahului-Airport-maui-parking-rental-car-structure-v2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798881", "eventUri": "eng-9798881", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Log in now to continue reading.\n\nDustin Tester of Maui Surfer Girls initially thought setting a $50,000 goal on her GoFundMe page to raise funds after the Aug. 8 Maui wildfires was \"too much of an ask.\"\n\nHowever, just three months later her ask surpassed $140,000.\n\nThe outpouring of financial support through donations in the days and weeks after the wildfires was tremendous and came from various sources, small to large -- through small individual checks, dozens of GoFundMe accounts, the People's Fund of Maui launched by celebrities Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne Johnson, or millions channeled through the Hawaii Community Foundation.\n\nApproaching a year since the disaster, it may be impossible to know with certainty what all the donations amount to.\n\nGoFundMe's Wildfire Relief Fund, which has facilitated over 2,000 immediate-relief grants to those affected by the fires and supported local nonprofit organizations on the ground, has raised $1.3 million.\n\nBut the website reported that within the past year more than $65 million has been raised through pages set up on the platform to directly help victims affected by the Maui wildfires from donors around the world.\n\n\"Seven of my 12 team members lost their homes, so of course I rallied and had a GoFundMe page up within 24 hours of the fires,\" Tester, 51, said.\n\nThe surfing school and camp, which has been serving tourists and locals for nearly 25 years, has had most of its team members as part of the family for a decade. While seven staff members lost their homes, the remaining five lost their jobs because Maui Surfer Girls had to close its business.\n\nMore than $120,000 of the donations went to help Tester's staff members, and the remaining funds are allocated to scholarships for the surfing camps hosted by the surf school.\n\nTester said it was also important to allocate a portion of the donations toward scholarships for surfing camps because, since the fires, business has been slow. If she cannot attract clients, it would have a domino effect, potentially leading to layoffs of her instructors, which she hopes to avoid.\n\nOverwhelming support\n\nWith nearly 1,000 donors, Tester said the community's support meant much more to her than financial aid from government agencies or the loans she received because it represented genuine care and solidarity.\n\nShe also noted that the GoFundMe page doesn't fully capture all the donations, as her instructors received individual contributions of various amounts through Venmo from clients.\n\n\"It was so heartfelt to see the overwhelming support from the community,\" Tester said. \"I appreciated all the government assistance, but the support from tourists and clients far exceeded what the county and government provided.\"\n\nAnother small business in Lahaina that was destroyed, Baya Bowls, received donations from tourists on its GoFundMe page.\n\nIsabel Velazquez, from Chicago, wrote on Ceone Nojima-Jacinto's GoFundMe page, \"Visited on a quick trip to Lahaina and felt the magic of the town just by sitting down and enjoying Baya Bowls! I'll cherish all my memories there. Great serv\u00adice! This small business deserves a chance to rebuild just like the rest of Lahaina. Sending lots of love from Chicago.\"\n\nThe GoFundMe page also reached an international audience, including Caroline Kropack: \"Every time we have visited Maui from Melbourne Australia we always went to Baya Bowls. One of our favorite places on the beautiful island. Maui holds a special place in our hearts as it was where we were married. Being operators of a food business ourselves, we have always admired Ceone's passion and her beautiful business. We were heartbroken to see what's been happening to so many there in Lahaina. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all. We know the wondrous and unique spirit of the islands will continue to give you all strength.\"\n\nBaya Bowls, owned by Nojima-Jacinto, had been operating for nearly eight years before the fires but has not been able to reopen since. Nojima-Jacinto's sister created a GoFundMe page with a goal of raising $25,000. By the end of July, the campaign received over 300 donations, totaling more than $30,000.\n\n\"Things were going pretty well; we even survived through COVID,\" she said. \"But when the fires happened we lost both food trucks.\n\n\"Everyone around us lost their homes, but we didn't lose ours. It puts things into perspective. It was hard to grieve for the business because there were so many bigger and more important issues for everyone else. There was just so much going on at the time.\"\n\nThree of Nojima-Jacinto's four employees lost their homes, and she said she was able to continue paying their salaries for a few months. Additionally, she distributed checks to them for fire relief using the GoFundMe funds.\n\nDirecting donations\n\nWhen disaster strikes around the world, many people direct their donations to United Way and similar organizations.\n\nAloha United Way Vice President Agnieszka Westfal- Conboy said approximately two-thirds of the disaster relief funds AUW received after the wildfires came from the mainland, rather than Hawaii.\n\nAs of July 29, AUW raised over $4.2 million for the Maui Fire Relief Fund, with all proceeds going directly to support Maui United Way's relief efforts where it distributed over $7.8 million to nearly 8,000 fire-affected people shortly after the fires.\n\nHawaii Community Foundation President Micah Kane expressed his gratification that resources have been reaching the right people.\n\n\"We're going to continue to learn from this and ensure that resources keep reaching those in need,\" he said.\n\nKane said the Maui Strong Fund under HCF has raised $195 million from over 240,000 individual donors and more than 5,000 corporate contributors across 78 countries and all U.S. states and territories.\n\nThe interest earned from donations, which is reinvested into the fund, has accumulated to approximately $5 million.\n\nAccording to Kane, the Maui Strong Fund has the highest amount he has ever seen across all HCF funds.\n\n\"We're still accepting contributions,\" Kane said. \"The contribution per week varies, but it's starting to go down and we've accepted that.\"\n\nOf the Maui Strong Fund, there's still about $85 million remaining.\n\n\"We want to be here for Maui, and we're keeping the fund active as long as people are wanting to give support,\" Kane said. \"We're going to find that in the later months a lot of these federal resources are going to dry up. We want to be strategically positioned to support the communities where it's needed most.\"\n\nKane said HCF plans to continue distributing resources, with the approach being heavily guided by community input and collaboration with community partners.\n\nHe mentioned that most of the funding has been allocated to supporting community members with case management, particularly in helping them complete forms for grant applications.\n\n\"Some of the recent grants were made to organizations that are trying to help fill gaps that government systems are missing,\" Kane said. \"Government has some limitations in how they can operate, and we don't have those limitations.\"\n\nOther funds\n\nSome other funding sources, including the People's Fund of Maui, had been exhausted as of late February. The fund was established Aug. 31, committing $10 million to provide direct cash payments to Maui residents whose homes were lost or uninhabitable.\n\nLahaina residents Keahi Ho and Ali Grimes, who lost both their private sailing charter business, Gungho Sailing, and their home to the fires, were recipients of the People's Fund of Maui, which provided monthly \"allowances\" to residents affected by the fires.\n\nStarting Sept. 19 and continuing through late February, the organization distributed $1,200 per month to over 8,100 Maui residents for six months, totaling nearly $60 million.\n\nPartners Ho and Grimes used the monthly funding to help rebuild their lives in Lahaina.\n\n\"It really helped us survive through the first six months,\" Ho said. \"We had to reestablish our entire life, which involved a lot of expenses and costs. At the time, we were also taking care of five kids, my mom and some friends.\"\n\nGrimes purchased a home in April 2023 and had been working on building it, but after the fires they needed to do significantly more work to make it livable.\n\n\"It's had a huge financial impact on our lives,\" Grimes said. \"We're looking into year one feeling pretty great about overall financial support, but year two is looking financially more difficult for our family, being stuck in limbo, not being able to reopen our business.\"\n\n\"Every single person we know from Lahaina has suffered quite a bit, whether they have insurance or are underinsured, whether they have a business open or they can't get back to their business. It's not at all what it was. We've been trying to remain positive and do our best through all the pivoting, but it's a long turn pit for everybody.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

There's a cleaving in how we see the world and our place in it. Are we living in a world of abundance and possibility? Or are we living in a time of scarcity and decline?\n\nWe've been grappling with this question in the year after the fires killed 102 people on Maui and displaced thousands.\n\nI've covered disasters, wars and genocides in my career and I've been able to maintain an overall sense of optimism despite witnessing depravity and hopelessness.\n\nBut like so many of us, I've been struggling to feel optimistic and hopeful for Maui this past year.\n\nWhat happened shouldn't have happened, and so many of the people of Maui valiantly responded.\n\nHowever, I can't shake the feeling of hollowness in the way we've collectively responded to the loss of Lahaina. Yes, we opened up our hearts and were generous with our contributions, but the devastation on Maui was immense, and even $4 billion won't come close to solving the problems.\n\nSo many things went wrong and so little has happened to make things right.\n\nThe communities on Maui and Molokai responded quickly and bravely and Lahaina Strong persisted to create a significant policy change on vacation rentals, but a year after the immediate pledges to rise stronger from the ashes, Maui and Hawaii are still profoundly broken.\n\nWe are no more secure and safe, and the leaders who have made those pledges have failed us. Yet, what's broken here isn't beyond repair. We just don't have the right craftspeople wielding the proper tools at this moment.\n\nWe know the truth that the dead and displaced were failed by Hawaii's physical and human infrastructure. We weren't ready or resilient.\n\nIn the wake of the fire, Lt. Gov. Sylvia Luke told the ugly truth: We were unprepared.\n\nSadly, that's still the case.\n\nThe fire that destroyed Lahaina was not the last wildfire. We've had fire after fire after fire. We know more fires will come and the waters will rise.\n\nWe had people who stepped up and offered a different way of solving our problems. However, they weren't supported and too many of them have stepped away.\n\nI've talked with too many akamai people with generational ties to Hawaii who feel fed up and forsaken by the system that has been in place here for decades.\n\nRight now, Hawaii's fate is to be the province of the ultra-wealthy, retirees and the low-wage earners that serve them. That path ultimately serves no one.\n\nHawaii isn't sustainable in our current version of capitalism that favors individual profit over greater good for all. Hawaii has been an American political, economic and ideological outpost in the Pacific hemisphere and the land and people have suffered for it.\n\nWe are an ecosystem out of balance. We need less greed and individualism and more sharing and community.\n\nSaturday is an election day, but change in Hawaii isn't going to happen at the ballot box. The system hasn't served the people. It's no wonder that many of our best and brightest can't be bothered to fill public servant roles. The roles are in service of a system that hurts Hawaii.\n\nI want to have hope. We need to have it. While a thousand students are no longer in Lahaina schools, there are thousands of kids still on Maui.\n\nI can't shake the idea that there are young people who grew up in Lahaina who are going to get chased from Hawaii as a result of the fires.\n\nNot enough was done to keep families on Maui and in Hawaii and the exodus has been profound. Even before the fires, people were leaving for economic opportunities elsewhere. We've had generation after generation that have found lives outside of Hawaii, but that also means that there are generations that are dying far away from Hawaii.\n\nI'm haunted by the words of researcher Adam Keawe Manolo-Camp: \"I don't want to die away from my homeland.\"\n\nWhen I think about Lahaina decades from now, I'm worried about the young person who grew up on Maui, survived the fires and has then found a life outside of the islands and never returned to Hawaii Nei.\n\nI think about this because that's what happened to my father. He watched his Hawaiian town, Hilo, be destroyed by the tsunami in 1960. He was soon to leave and never to live there again.\n\nHis life after Hilo was a happy one, but he wanted to return to live in Hawaii and never did. Can we now create a Hawaii where locals and natives can build stable and secure lives and communities?\n\nI am hopeful for Maui and Hawaii because time hasn't run out. We can fix our broken islands if we create shared visions that benefit many, not just a few. We've done it in the past and we need to do it for the generations to come.", "source": {"uri": "civilbeat.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Civil Beat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naka_nathaniel@civilbeat.org", "name": "Naka Nathaniel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Hawaii", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molokai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Molokai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Molokai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Luke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sylvia Luke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Individualism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilo,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hilo, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hilo, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2023/07/24153855/lahaina9-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798881", "eventUri": "eng-9798881", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

That lingering uncertainty has created nearly $1 billion in lost revenue for the Hawaiian island, which has historically relied on tourism for 70% of every dollar in its local economy, according to the Maui Economic Development Board.\n\nOfficially, all of Maui - with the exception of the burn zone in Lahaina - has been open for business since Nov. 1. But arrivals in the first half of 2024 were down roughly 25% year over year, with 1.1 million visitors, compared with nearly 1.5 million in the first half of 2023, according to the state's Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism. Spending was similarly down, from $3.47 billion in the first half of 2023 to $2.64 billion for the first half of 2024.\n\nBusinesses on the west side of the island have been hit particularly hard. Lahaina is the gateway to the area, including the iconic, cliff-lined resort town of Ka'anapali, but there's only one road to get to that. Technically the burn zone represented 3.4 square miles out of 727 square miles total on the island. But even if they're staying in the west coast resort towns untouched by catastrophe, many travelers don't want to drive past the destruction.\n\nA phased reopening also left many people confused about exactly what sections were acceptable to visit. Josh Hargrove, general manager at the Westin Maui Resort & Spa, Ka'anapali, notes occupancy is down 30% to 40% at his hotel and others on the west side, despite a $160 million glow-up to his property, which added a 10,000-square-foot arcade with TopGolf Swing Suites and a restaurant from chef Peter Merriman, a Hawaiian culinary pioneer.\n\n\"People still feel guilty coming to Maui to celebrate in front of workers who have lost everything,\" Hargrove says, despite the series of industry-centric pep rallies and pitch meetings he and his colleagues have held to remind travel agents and event planners how critical their business is to the island's recovery. \"That's where we're stuck right now.\"\n\nEven locals who were previously critical of the tourism industry now hope to see busier days. Take Martin Giroud, an industrial designer who lives in Haiku, a small town in upcountry Maui an hour's drive from Lahaina; for years he's lamented that the island felt overrun by tourists. \"Honestly, I don't know anyone complaining about tourism right now,\" he says. \"It feels so quiet, and with the cost of living we need business.\"\n\nGiroud believes that closing off the west side was the right decision so that the island could heal and clean up efforts could get underway, but it's time to move forward. \"I went to Lahaina recently and for the first time didn't cry,\" he says. \"Totally the opposite. I saw progress, and I felt excited for the people to come back and start rebuilding their homes and bring life there again.\"\n\nA great time to visit\n\nThe irony is that from a tourist's perspective, there hasn't been a better time to visit Maui in years. Beaches are quiet, the resorts on the island are pristine and businesses have never been more appreciative of tourists.\n\nFewer than 260 hotel rooms island-wide remain occupied by displaced families, says Ilihia Gionson, a public affairs officer with the Hawaii Tourism Authority, allaying a common traveler worry that a hotel booking, on any part of the island, takes housing away from fire victims. But state and federal programs to house the displaced in hotel rooms has ended, he adds, and the government is now concluding a process of moving any remaining families from hotels to longer-term housing. \"If one of Maui's 13,000 hotel rooms is listed available, then you are not kicking anyone out,\" Gionson says.\n\nAnd while hotels aren't discounting as a result of the fires - the average daily rate was $563 in June, more than $100 per night pricier than any other island in Hawaii - travelers can find a number of incentives, such as a third night free or resort credits.\n\nNearly a dozen hotels have used the post-fire lull to complete renovations and enhancements. A multimillion-dollar revamp of the Fairmont Kea Lani in Wailea, for example, includes refreshed suites and villas, an ocean-facing bar (the largest on Maui) and an immersive cultural center. And the Grand Wailea Maui, a Waldorf Astoria Resort, recently completed the final stage of its $300 million renovation, which included a 50,000-square-foot spa (the largest in Hawaii), an outpost of the Florida-based longevity clinic the Biostation, and open-air hydrothermal gardens that include a saltwater pool and waterfall showers.\n\nResorts are also highlighting opportunities to volunteer and hosting pop-up events to make it easier for guests to support local businesses affected by the fires. The Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa in Ka'anapali has been holding a monthly market in its lobby featuring 20 Lahaina small businesses that lost their brick-and-mortar locations. The next is scheduled for Aug. 30.\n\nKevin Schenk, the Hawaiian owner of ecotourism operator Seeding the Future, says interest in volunteering has been high. His company, which offers corporate groups the opportunity to help with reforestation efforts, has seen its bookings take off.\n\n\"People who are traveling to Maui want to give back,\" he says. On his outings, the focus is on transplanting the nursery-grown saplings of indigenous flora. These native plants, Schenk notes, are critical for mitigating fire risk in the future.\n\nChallenges remain\n\nIt's not just low demand that's crushing businesses: It's also a worker shortage, exacerbated by rising housing costs in the fire's aftermath that are forcing many locals off the island. For people who work as restaurant servers, taxi drivers and other tourism-adjacent jobs, moving to the mainland in search of steady work and affordable housing has sometimes proved easier than continuing to wait it out on Maui.\n\nAs I was returning from a reporting trip in early August, my ride-share driver Justin, who was born and raised on Maui, shared that business has been so ominously slow this summer, he's considering moving to Las Vegas, where work is guaranteed. \"Maui will always be home and I'll miss the beauty of the island, but I've given up hope that I'll be able to afford to buy a home here,\" he says. As of June, the price of a single-family home was $1.35 million, up 30.8% over the same month last year, according to the Realtors Association of Maui.\n\nFor Karen Christenson, owner of the popular Polynesian-themed restaurant Mama's Fish House on the north shore, that's made staffing a top concern. \"We have employees who are struggling to find housing in this new reality on Maui,\" she says. \"Housing on our entire island is a major ongoing issue, not just West Maui.\"\n\nNew legislature regulating short-term rentals may help, and Maui Mayor Richard Bissen has proposals to eliminate more than 7,000 vacation units - more than half the island's inventory - and make them available again for locals by January 2026.\n\n\"These changes will take time to impact locals, and a lot of people are throwing their hands up and moving off island,\" says Brett Sheerin, owner of Maui True North water sports company. \"I'm lucky to have regular clients, but the mood right now is pretty somber.\"\n\nMixed messaging\n\nThe biggest problem remains misinformation, and how it's preventing people from visiting at all.\n\n\"I recently had a group of Germans who told me that their friends think the entire island burned,\" says Donnie Arnoult, owner of Maui Cyclery, adding that his bike shop in the North Shore town of Paia is down nearly 50% in tour bookings compared with 2023. Before the fires, his bike tours were booked daily, typically with six people per tour. Now, he says, he's lucky to get one or two people booking a few days a week.\n\nSeeding the Future's Schenk agrees. He says bookings at his other company, Helewai Eco-Tours, are way down for the hikes his company leads on the west side, despite being entirely unaffected by the fires.\n\nSeeing an entire town engulfed in flame is a tough image to erase from tourists' pysches. And even as West Maui began a phased reopening on Oct. 8, official messaging about which areas were off-limits remained blurred.\n\n\"People assume all of Lahaina burned to the ground and are being told to keep away,\" says Gunars Valkirs, chief executive officer of Maui Ku'ia Estate Chocolate, who estimates his business revenue is down 60% year over year. \"The messaging needs to be more specific. We should be saying West Maui is ready to receive visitors.\"\n\nThe messaging, instead, was convoluted. In June, Hawaii Tourism Authority issued a statement saying Lahaina was closed to the public, overlooking that every address on the west side of the island shares a ZIP code with Lahaina, including hotels in Ka'anapali and Kapualua such as the Ritz-Carlton Maui, Kapalua and Montage Kapalua Bay. It updated the statement a week later to clarify - but not before stoking confusion that has been crushing west-side businesses.\n\n\"So far, summer season is feast or famine,\" says Riley Coons, director of sustainable tourism at Sail Trilogy, whose operation had to move from Lahaina Harbor to Maalea Harbor, closer to central Maui. \"Some days are busy, some are slow.\" Overall, he says, revenue is down more than 30% year to date, and the future is unclear.\n\nWhat is clear is that a lot has changed on the ground since the weeks following the disaster, when emotions ran high and tourists faced tough moral choices. But the messaging that travels farthest hasn't made the same progress.\n\nAs the Tourism Authority's Gionson puts it, \"The call to stay away always resounds exponentially louder than the call to return.\"\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

A young man with a white flower tucked behind his ear sat behind a desk near the door, smiling as he greeted visitors.

There are FEMA and Red Cross tables, but everything that happens here is led by locals. The staff themselves are Lahaina survivors, some of whom lost their own homes.\n\n\"We created this center as a way to culturally approach the disaster recovery,\" said Kuhio Lewis, the council's CEO. \"The concept here is come in, feel the spirit of aloha, see somebody that you're familiar with, so we can help you through the process.\"\n\nMore than 6,000 families have been helped at the center, but this is only one piece of CNHA's robust recovery project. It financially supports families who take in displaced loved ones, leases apartments for survivors, runs workforce development programs to train people for cleanup and construction jobs, and builds temporary housing for families.\n\nIts work has helped fill the gap between Maui residents and federal and nonprofit agencies from the continental United States who struggled to grasp Hawaii's landscape, culture, and the historical trauma its people already bore.\n\n\"We understand the needs of the community a lot better,\" said Lewis.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with Lewis a few weeks before the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 8, 2023 fires. He discussed what it was like to suddenly receive support from all over the world, how CNHA became one of the most crucial providers of housing for survivors, what he's most proud of, and what still worries him about Maui's long recovery.\n\nHis answers have been edited for clarity and length.\n\n_____\n\nQ: The flood of donations to Maui broke records. What was it like to receive such a sudden rush of support?\n\nA: We've had over 22,000 donors from all over the world. They were small -- as little as $5. There was a kid from another state who sent us a letter in the mail with $12 cash. He said he recycled cans and wanted to support. That's the stuff you don't forget. Maybe you got a $100,000 check earlier in the week, but that $12 meant a lot for that kid.\n\nThe in-kind donations must have been in the millions. All of the shipping costs for the building supplies. The stoves and microwaves and AC needed for the homes we're building. The warehouse space for donations. School supplies. Everybody is throwing in.\n\nBetween the money we've raised, the money that we've gotten from Hawaii Community Foundation, which has been very supportive of our work, and the money we've gotten from the government, it's over $40 million.\n\nIt's getting harder to raise money. We're still living off of what we raised in the first five months or so. But the money's going to run out at some point. Which is partly why we've pivoted to housing. It has a longer lifespan.\n\n_____\n\nQ: Some of CNHA's most innovative programs have centered on housing. How did you craft your strategy?\n\nA: When we first launched our resource center, the community was telling us, \"We need housing.\" There were 12,000 individuals that were displaced. That was around 9,000 families that needed someplace to go.\n\nMany survivors were already staying with friends and family. That's very normal in a Hawaii community, where you lean on your friends and family. So we came up with our first program, which was the Host Housing Support Program, where we provided financial help to those that were caretaking for survivors. That was unique.\n\nAs things started to progress, we started renting homes under our organization and subletting them to survivors to minimize the amount of back and forth that would have been required between survivors, who were already going through a lot, and landlords.\n\nOver longer periods of time, the rental market is just too much to sustain. We ultimately landed on, we just have to start building houses. We're building over 60 temporary two-bedroom units. These will serve as dwellings for at least five years.\n\nThe strong community sentiment was that they wanted to stay in West Maui, and they wanted to raise their kids in West Maui. It's all towards the end of helping them repopulate back in Lahaina. While you're going through the steps of rebuilding, at least you have someplace to live. But the idea here is to get them back to full normalcy.\n\n_____\n\nQ: CNHA wasn't founded as a disaster recovery organization. Have you worried about straying too far from the council's mission?\n\nA: Our mission is to advance -- culturally, politically, economically -- Native Hawaiians. And we are doing that, because Native Hawaiians are leading this recovery.\n\nIt hasn't taken us away from our mission, because at the end of the day, we're for a thriving Hawaii. In this moment, I see our organization as Hawaiians helping to uplift Hawaii. This is our homeland. If we're native to this place, we have a responsibility to take care of the people that live here, regardless of their ethnic background.\n\nSometimes we get too caught up in how to serve ourselves in our ethnic groups. That's not who we are as a people, as a culture. It's always been inclusive. And so this has returned us to that. We help everybody. It's the spirit of aloha.\n\n_____\n\nQ: In many ways, Maui is only at the beginning of its recovery. At this stage, what worries you most?\n\nA: One of the key things that I'm most concerned about is Hawaii's fabric.\n\nWhat makes Hawaii unique, compared to anywhere around the world, is the culture. And when you start to see mass exodus of the people, you start to change the fabric of Hawaii. That's what's at stake is the future of who Hawaii is as a people, as a place.\n\nWe've lost thousands already to this fire. They've moved off island, to other states. Even before the fire, we were seeing a mass exodus of families leaving for stability outside of Hawaii because the cost of living was just too high.\n\nWe need to address the housing situation on Maui. And in the end, what happened here has actually fast-tracked that conversation. Now you're starting to see the policies to shift that trajectory.\n\nA: It meant a lot to hand keys over to this young family that lost everything. I went up (to the 50-unit development being built in Kahului) the other day to check on the progress of the homes, and the kids were playing in the yard. They made their own little makeshift pool using a tarp, and they were just playing water.\n\nWe've been able to give keys to a number of families at this point, and we'll continue to give those keys.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Now you're starting to see the policies to shift that trajectory.\n\nA: It meant a lot to hand keys over to this young family that lost everything. I went up (to the 50-unit development being built in Kahului) the other day to check on the progress of the homes, and the kids were playing in the yard. They made their own little makeshift pool using a tarp, and they were just playing water.\n\nWe've been able to give keys to a number of families at this point, and we'll continue to give those keys.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The reason for the sign is understandable; the last thing Lahaina's residents and business owners need one year after the worst wildfire in modern U.S. history are inconsiderate tourists or anything disrupting the huge recovery effort underway since 102 people died and 6,200 families were upended on Aug. 8, 2023.\n\nBut for an economy that is 40% driven by tourism and where three of four private sector jobs are in hospitality, acceptance of visitors sharing publicly accessible areas with debris removers, construction crews and many others is vital to the comeback of a region plagued with two disasters within a four-year period. Helping give West Maui its grit are the combined essence of \"Lahaina Strong,\" a phrase that arose from the ashes, and the unceasing \"aloha spirit\" for which all of Hawaii is known.\n\n\"Communities and neighbors coming together to cry, hug and support each other emotionally, visitors joining in the efforts, contributing their help and expressing their love for the people and places here -- these acts of kindness and compassion have been constant reminders that 'Lahaina Strong' and 'aloha spirit' are not mere phrases, but a way of life deeply embedded in the hearts and minds of everyone in this resilient town and throughout Maui,\" said Ashley Davis, co-owner of Mala Ocean Tavern, the first restaurant to reopen in Lahaina after both the pandemic and fire.\n\nExcept for smoke damage, Mala (malatavern.com) weathered the firestorm like a champ. Being spared the same fate that destroyed most of the town, including nearly everything for blocks north of the oceanfront restaurant, made it possible to reopen within six months. Every day since, serving sumptuous avocado toast, poisson cru and signature seared ahi has been bittersweet for management and staff.\n\n\"With survivor's guilt comes the joy of being able to have something of Lahaina where people can feel a bit of normalcy,\" said Davis, noting that Mala has been a staple in the community since 2004. \"Seeing the heart-filled emotions and gratitude from locals, guests and workers is a blessing. Many of our staff lost their homes, everything, so knowing how lucky we were really motivated us to reopen.\"\n\nHeading south on Front Street, beyond manned barricades, the iconic Lahaina Banyan Tree is showing signs of life one year later. Arborists are optimistic that the beloved 151-year-old tree has an excellent chance to regenerate. Same with the town itself, though it may be later than sooner, according to a couple of self-described \"realistic\" Hawaii National Guard members stationed at a road closure behind the surviving Safeway.\n\nWhile a cohesive community picks up the pieces both figuratively and literally, compassionate visitors able to compartmentalize their emotions can absolutely enjoy a wonderful vacation in West Maui and throughout this resilient island.\n\nSince food is where the heart is, and we already visited Mala, let's not put down the knife and fork just yet.\n\nNew since the fire paused West Maui's tourism industry are two signature restaurants within major Ka'anapali resorts at varying stages of renovation.\n\nUlu Kitchen (ulukitchen.com) by acclaimed chef Peter Merriman is part of a multi-year, $160 million transformation of the Westin Maui Resort & Spa Ka'anapali (westinmaui.com), and how wonderful that this prime location adjacent to Whaler's Village has a winning concept after several tries of middling success. On the breakfast menu are the best pancakes in West Maui. It's Ulu's Monkeypod Mai Tai Flapjacks, topped with the same to-die-for lilikoi foam dolloped on mai tais across Merriman's yummy portfolio. Before we leave the Westin, a shoutout to the Wailele Luau for making upgrades since the fire, now becoming the big kahuna of resort luaus with an impressive gourmet buffet (including an adorable one just for kids), dazzling show and generous selection of top-shelf spirits at no extra charge.\n\nFurther up well-manicured Ka'anapali Beach Walk is the recently opened Maui Brewing Co. (mauibrewingco.com) at what is now the Outrigger Ka'anapali Beach Resort (outrigger.com). These properties are successful reincarnations of the former and meh Hui Hui restaurant at the former and meh Ka'anapali Beach Hotel, which changed hands only two weeks before the fire. The new owners of the 11-acre, 432-room resort are already winning points with plans to renovate the tired lobby and other areas that were neglected for decades.\n\nTwo of the tastiest ticketed attractions in Lahaina reopened before spring. Old Lahaina Luau (oldlahainaluau.com), which miraculously endured only minor damage on its grounds, has added gravitas to its nightly feast for the eyes and palate. A heartfelt tribute and moment of silence, led by the cast and crew, is as lovely as a portion of each evening's sales going to local causes. Same at Maui Kuia Estate Chocolate (www.mauichocolate.com), which is giving back 100% of its net profits from its daily tours and island-made confections to local nonprofits. The factory fared well during last year's disaster, but the 100-mph winds that fueled the fire defoliated all of the cacao trees at the nearby farm, resulting in a loss of Kuia's fall crop. Factory tours have since resumed for sweet-toothed visitors looking for something different to do, although ominous is the sight of where the fire cherry-picked its structural victims adjacent to the home of Maui's finest chocolate.\n\nFrom candy to fruit, Maui Gold Pineapple lost its Front Street store, warehouse and offices in Lahaina on that horrendous August day, but one of the island's best agricultural tours is still going strong like a potent pi\u00f1a colada. Maui Gold's \"Pineapple Pledge,\" launched three days after the fire, includes supplying food banks and those without access to resources with product that visitors can see in various growth stages three times daily. Further information is available at mauipineappletour.com.\n\nWorthy of a 10-minute detour between the airport and Lahaina, in the underappreciated Wailuku Historic District, is the island's largest outdoor sculpture exhibit at the Imua Discovery Garden (discoverimua.com). Gracing the sprawling grounds of a child-development nonprofit through December is \"Earth to Sky,\" an immersive and expansive display by Steve Tobin, who is perhaps best known for his 9/11 bronze memorial, \"Trinity Root,\" installed near Ground Zero in Manhattan.\n\nLahaina was the epicenter of last year's fatal tragedy, but other parts of Maui suffered, too, albeit economically, as tourism dropped 42% in October compared to the same time in 2022. Even the north side's revered Mama's Fish House (mamasfishhouse.com), where the wait list can be months long, was gladly taking walk-ins in the aftermath. A few weeks ago, however, the place was noticeably back to its hopping, post-COVID self with unparalleled atmosphere and fish-featuring fare, and no signs of what owner Karen Christenson has described as a \"super rough four years.\"\n\nShowing promise as the beefy equal to fishy Mama's in terms of impeccable quality and service, Wolfgang's Steakhouse opened in April at The Shops at Wailea. This rookie sensation is aesthetically stunning thanks to a $9-million renovation of a former Longhi's restaurant, and unapologetic for its prices -- the a la carte filet mignon is $121. Wolfgang's (wolfgangssteakhouse.net) also prides itself on having a bar menu of which half of the labels aren't found anywhere else on Maui. The joint even has seven different single malt Macallan whiskies. From the 13-ingredient Beverly Hills salad to the steaks dry-aged on premises, leaving room for a killer New York cheesecake that does the company's Big Apple roots proud, Wolfgang's, sticker shock and all, is one of the best non-Hawaiian restaurants in Hawaii.\n\nNew ways to splurge are also found at the Kilolani Spa at the Grand Wailea (spa.grandwailea.com). The services and staff are first-rate, similar to what's offered at other five-star resorts around the world, although few spas are this large; at 50,000 square feet and 40 treatment rooms, it's the largest in the state. Serious wow factor is found at the Hydrotherapy Gardens, a tropical sanctuary for soaking, steaming and general destressing. The spa sells two-hour Gardens passes for $125, but the best deal is a $49 add-on with another treatment.\n\nAn onsite spa is about the only thing missing from the otherwise paradisical Hotel Wailea, Maui's sole adults-only luxury resort. Massages and other treatments are done in-room by reservation, and that's totally workable because each of the cliffside property's 72 suites is spacious and serene. Set on a hill 300 feet above sea level, Hotel Wailea (hotelwailea.com) offers panoramic ocean views and a shuttle that takes guests to a nearby white sand beach or anywhere in town from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Since the fire, the resort opened an open-air lounge bar and restaurant featuring Japanese-influenced menu items. The Birdcage is appropriately named as feathered friends people watch from the rafters above. For those who've wondered what Disneyland's Enchanted Tiki Room would be like as a restaurant, here's the place.\n\nAlso on the 15 Zen-inspired acres are a retro, '60s-vibe pool with no frills other than a bar, cabanas and inflatable toys. The gorgeous grounds also have two romantic dining options. One is an intimate dining experience with a private chef who prepares a seven-course dinner under a canopy of mango and avocado trees. The other is the signature restaurant, simply called The Restaurant, where proactive, in-the-know patrons will request a table in The Garden, a magical alfresco setting.", "source": {"uri":

Green and Community...", "body": "LAHAINA, HAWAI\u02bbI -- On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the devastating historic Maui wildfires, Governor Josh Green, M.D., today visited the La'ik\u016b temporary housing project along Lahainaluna Road to highlight ongoing efforts to provide housing for community members who lost their homes on Aug. 8, 2023.\n\n\"We are continuing to focus on providing those impacted by the fires with longer-term housing for Maui wildfire survivors,\" said Governor Green. \"While La'ik\u016b is a relatively small project, every unit that we develop means one more family will have a more stable housing environment and a foundation to help rebuild their lives and continue healing.\"\n\nLa'ik\u016b, which means 'a calming space,' is being developed in partnership between Governor Green's Administration including the Hawai\u02bbi Department of Transportation (HDOT) and the Hawai\u02bbi Department of Education (DOE), as well as the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA) and the Hawai\u02bbi Community Foundation (HCF) Maui Strong Fund. La'ik\u016b will provide 16 two-bedroom, one-bath units at 560 sq. ft. each. The homes are being built on approximately two acres of land that was previously acquired by the HDOT as part of the Lahaina Bypass project.\n\nThe first two families began moving into La'ik\u016b on July 23 and two families are in the process of moving in. Four additional units will be completed on Aug. 9, and the remaining eight units will be delivered by September.\n\n\"La'ik\u016b symbolizes our promise to Lahaina,\" said K\u016bhi\u014d Lewis, CEO of CNHA. \"Welcoming families into new homes shows progress and resilience, thanks to strong partnerships and our K\u0101ko\u02bbo Maui team.\"\n\n\"This collaborative effort to provide safe and secure housing for Maui's fire survivors is a key priority for the Maui Strong Fund of the Hawai'i Community Foundation,\" said Micah K\u0101ne, HCF CEO and president. \"We will continue to work with government partners, nonprofits, and the community to find solutions that support Maui's journey toward recovery.\"\n\nMonthly rent for homes in La'ik\u016b is $1,750, which tenants can pay via personal funds, rental assistance from FEMA, or insurance proceeds. Water and sewer services, up to $75 per month as well as trash removal, are included for each unit. Family dogs and cats of up to 50 pounds are welcomed in the neighborhood.\n\nThere is no income limit for applicants, whose eligibility for tenancy will be verified as wildfire-impacted by the CNHA K\u0101ko\u02bbo Maui Resource Center. Families who may have temporarily relocated to other islands are also eligible to apply. Units must be occupied by a minimum of two, or up to a maximum of five people. Parking is limited to two vehicles per unit. Street parking is not allowed. Applications for La\u02bbik\u016b may be submitted online via helpingmaui.org or by visiting the CNHA K\u0101ko\u02bbo Maui Resource Center at Maui Mall during regular business hours.\n\nAbout CNHA\n\nThe Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA) is a member-based nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing the cultural, economic, political and community development of Native Hawaiians. CNHA supports and promotes activities that benefit the Native Hawaiian community and fosters the well-being of Native Hawaiians through various initiatives and partnerships.\n\nAbout the HCF Maui Strong Fund\n\nThe Maui Strong Fund of the Hawai'i Community Foundation is providing financial resources to support the immediate and long-term recovery needs for the people and places affected by the Maui wildfires.

A young man with a white flower tucked behind his ear sat behind a desk near the door, smiling as he greeted visitors. Hawaiian music played overhead, and a television screen looped images of colorful hibiscus and bright beaches. Two men were \"talking story\" in the waiting area, trading stories of what they each lost in the fire, as they waited their turn to receive the essential services offered here.\n\nThis converted storefront inside a Kahului strip mall is the hub of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, or CNHA, a 23-year-old organization that has become a crucial leader in Maui\u00b4s recovery from the devastating fires that killed at least 102 people and displaced 12,000.\n\nThe center is divided into stations that address various needs: housing, financial assistance and mental health support. There are FEMA and Red Cross tables, but everything that happens here is led by locals. The staff themselves are Lahaina survivors, some of whom lost their own homes.\n\n\"We created this center as a way to culturally approach the disaster recovery,\" said Kuhio Lewis, the council\u00b4s CEO. \"The concept here is come in, feel the spirit of aloha, see somebody that you\u00b4re familiar with, so we can help you through the process.\"\n\nMore than 6,000 families have been helped at the center, but this is only one piece of CNHA\u00b4s robust recovery project. It financially supports families who take in displaced loved ones, leases apartments for survivors, runs workforce development programs to train people for cleanup and construction jobs, and builds temporary housing for families.\n\nIts work has helped fill the gap between Maui residents and federal and nonprofit agencies from the continental United States who struggled to grasp Hawaii\u00b4s landscape, culture, and the historical trauma its people already bore.\n\n\"We understand the needs of the community a lot better,\" said Lewis.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with Lewis a few weeks before the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 8, 2023 fires. He discussed what it was like to suddenly receive support from all over the world, how CNHA became one of the most crucial providers of housing for survivors, what he\u00b4s most proud of, and what still worries him about Maui\u00b4s long recovery.\n\nHis answers have been edited for clarity and length.\n\n_____\n\nA: We\u00b4ve had over 22,000 donors from all over the world. They were small - as little as $5. There was a kid from another state who sent us a letter in the mail with $12 cash. He said he recycled cans and wanted to support. That\u00b4s the stuff you don\u00b4t forget. Maybe you got a $100,000 check earlier in the week, but that $12 meant a lot for that kid.\n\nThe in-kind donations must have been in the millions. All of the shipping costs for the building supplies. The stoves and microwaves and AC needed for the homes we\u00b4re building. The warehouse space for donations. School supplies. Everybody is throwing in.\n\nBetween the money we\u00b4ve raised, the money that we\u00b4ve gotten from Hawaii Community Foundation, which has been very supportive of our work, and the money we\u00b4ve gotten from the government, it\u00b4s over $40 million.\n\nIt\u00b4s getting harder to raise money. We\u00b4re still living off of what we raised in the first five months or so. But the money\u00b4s going to run out at some point. Which is partly why we\u00b4ve pivoted to housing. It has a longer lifespan.\n\n_____\n\nA: When we first launched our resource center, the community was telling us, \"We need housing.\" There were 12,000 individuals that were displaced. That was around 9,000 families that needed someplace to go.\n\nMany survivors were already staying with friends and family. That\u00b4s very normal in a Hawaii community, where you lean on your friends and family. So we came up with our first program, which was the Host Housing Support Program, where we provided financial help to those that were caretaking for survivors. That was unique.\n\nAs things started to progress, we started renting homes under our organization and subletting them to survivors to minimize the amount of back and forth that would have been required between survivors, who were already going through a lot, and landlords.\n\nOver longer periods of time, the rental market is just too much to sustain. We ultimately landed on, we just have to start building houses. We\u00b4re building over 60 temporary two-bedroom units. These will serve as dwellings for at least five years.\n\nThe strong community sentiment was that they wanted to stay in West Maui, and they wanted to raise their kids in West Maui. It\u00b4s all towards the end of helping them repopulate back in Lahaina. While you\u00b4re going through the steps of rebuilding, at least you have someplace to live. But the idea here is to get them back to full normalcy.\n\n_____\n\nA: Our mission is to advance - culturally, politically, economically - Native Hawaiians. And we are doing that, because Native Hawaiians are leading this recovery.\n\nIt hasn\u00b4t taken us away from our mission, because at the end of the day, we\u00b4re for a thriving Hawaii. In this moment, I see our organization as Hawaiians helping to uplift Hawaii. This is our homeland. If we\u00b4re native to this place, we have a responsibility to take care of the people that live here, regardless of their ethnic background.\n\nSometimes we get too caught up in how to serve ourselves in our ethnic groups. That\u00b4s not who we are as a people, as a culture. It\u00b4s always been inclusive. And so this has returned us to that. We help everybody. It\u00b4s the spirit of aloha.\n\n_____\n\nA: One of the key things that I\u00b4m most concerned about is Hawaii\u00b4s fabric.\n\nWhat makes Hawaii unique, compared to anywhere around the world, is the culture. And when you start to see mass exodus of the people, you start to change the fabric of Hawaii. That\u00b4s what\u00b4s at stake is the future of who Hawaii is as a people, as a place.\n\nWe\u00b4ve lost thousands already to this fire. They\u00b4ve moved off island, to other states. Even before the fire, we were seeing a mass exodus of families leaving for stability outside of Hawaii because the cost of living was just too high.\n\nWe need to address the housing situation on Maui. And in the end, what happened here has actually fast-tracked that conversation. Now you\u00b4re starting to see the policies to shift that trajectory.\n\nWe need people to stay home in Hawaii.\n\n_____\n\nA: It meant a lot to hand keys over to this young family that lost everything. I went up (to the 50-unit development being built in Kahului) the other day to check on the progress of the homes, and the kids were playing in the yard.

Log in now to continue reading.\n\nA year after a wildfire killed 102 people, destroyed Lahaina and left thousands without a home, the public has yet to learn what started the fire and where it began.\n\nThe Maui Department of Fire and Public Safety does not have a timetable for releasing its formal report on the origin and cause for Aug. 8 wildfires in Upcountry Maui and Lahaina, but said when the final report is ready a news conference will be called and the findings will be made public.\n\nIn more than 600 civil actions that are part of a proposed $4 billion dollar deal to settle all legal claims, plaintiffs have almost always blamed the fire on live power lines from Hawaiian Electric Co. that were downed by strong winds from a passing storm, the flames being fueled by dry vegetation on land owned by the state, Maui County, Kamehameha Schools and West Maui Land Co. Additionally, Spectrum Oceanic LLC and Hawaiian Telcom, which share infrastructure with Hawaiian Electric, are defendants in many cases.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has briefed the Maui fire department on its findings, but a finalized report has not yet been shared with the county in either electronic form or hard copy.\n\nMaui firefighters met with ATF the last week of June to review details of the ATF report on cause and origin, which is more than 400 pages long.\n\nThe methodical probe includes evidence gathered from hundreds of interviews and data pulled from images, radio traffic, private and public video feeds, and other sources.\n\nThe reams of data and physical evidence forced investigators to move carefully with great attention to detail.\n\nThe ATF's report will be attached as an addendum to the final origin and cause report that Maui county will release.\n\n\"ATF is assisting with this more complex, significant fire analysis. Once we receive the finalized ATF report, we look forward to incorporating it into our cause and origin report and releasing it publicly,\" County of Maui Fire and Public Safety Chief Bradford Ventura told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser in a statement. \"We understand the importance and urgency of getting this information to the public. Because of the gravity of these reports, federal and county officials are working diligently to ensure investigations are thorough, accurate and impartial, which can be time consuming.\"\n\nUnlike California, Hawaii has no state statutes creating criminal penalties for large wildfires that allow for prosecutions like the one Butte County District Attorney Michael Ramsey conducted following the 2018 Camp fire. That prosecution ended with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pleading guilty to 84 counts of manslaughter.\n\nIn April, Ventura released his department's after-\u00adaction report, which he commissioned from the Western Fire Chiefs Association to evaluate how firefighters handled the deadliest U.S. wildfire in at least a century.\n\nMaui firefighters were pushed \"to an unprecedented level of strain,\" according to the after-action report.\n\nIts 111 recommendations were broken into categories of preparation, mitigation and response. They included a call for coordinated evacuation plans, contingency plans, and firefighters and police operating out of the same command center.\n\nIt emphasized the long-standing need for more firefighters, fire stations, equipment and better technology and the need to set up official agreements to share emergency resources and personnel among fire departments statewide.\n\nState investigation\n\nThe state Department of the Attorney General hired the Fire Safety Research Institute shortly after the wildfires on Aug. 8 to conduct an investigation of government agency actions up to and during the first 24 to 72 hours of the Lahaina fire and its aftermath.\n\nFSRI's contract is currently capped at $4 million, a $2.5 million increase from the initial $1.5 million. The increase was approved March 19.\n\nThe state initially announced the probe would take 12 months, but difficulty coordinating interviews, completing document transfers and other logistical issues between the state, county and the many agencies involved in the fire response has delayed efforts.\n\nOne particular point of contention is the county's belief that a previous West Maui wildfire five years before the 2023 blazes and how government handled it is outside the scope of FSRI's contract to investigate.\n\nIn August 2018 a wildfire driven by 70 mph gusts from Hurricane Lane swept across the Lahaina hillsides, burning 2,000 acres, destroying 30 vehicles and 21 structures, most of them homes.\n\nCounty attorneys have tried to block efforts by the state to ask officials about the 2018 fires. County officials have refused to respond to Honolulu-Star-Advertiser questions about recommendations made in the aftermath of the 2018 West Maui fires.\n\nAn after-action report about the 2018 fires was only made public following a public records request related to the Aug. 8, 2023 fires.\n\nThe ongoing demands of complex civil litigation attached to more than 600 separate civil lawsuits has also helped slow the information flow.\n\n\"The Department of the Attorney General's Phase Two analysis is on track for release to the public by the end of the summer as planned. That report is an independent analysis of the events surrounding the fire and will assess the performance of state and county agencies in preparing for and responding to the Maui fires,\" said Toni Schwartz, public information officer for the state Department of the Attorney General. \"We don't have any further updates to provide. When a specific date is available, we will make it public.\"\n\nFSRI is a research institute dedicated to \"addressing the world's unresolved fire safety risks\" and emerging dangers, according to the state.\n\nThe second phase will be about six months of data analysis looking at how various fire protection systems functioned on Aug. 8, 2023.\n\nInvestigators will create a Incident Analysis Report that includes review of policies and actions of state and county agencies in preparing for and responding to the incident.\n\nThe final phase will result in a forward-looking report to answer the question, \"how do we prevent this from happening again?,\" the AG's Office said.\n\nMEMA report\n\nThe county is trying to find a contractor to review the actions of the Maui Emergency Management Agency, the agency tasked with managing and coordinating emergency response.\n\nMEMA came under heavy scrutiny in the aftermath of the devastating wildfires, with its former administrator Herman Andaya resigning Aug. 17 under criticism and international media attention after saying he did not regret the decision to not activate warning sirens during the catastrophe.\n\nThe county awarded a contract to a vendor after initial issues with the vendor's state compliance. But subsequently, the vendor revised its timeline to complete the work from 90 days to 16 weeks, prompting county officials to look for another group to do the MEMA review.\n\n\"The County is continuing the process to secure the next best, qualified vendor, and it is close to notifying a potential vendor of its selection,\" read a statement to the Star-Advertiser from county officials.",

In addition to continuing to assist the people of Maui in their greatest time of need - including nearly $3 billion in Federal support to response, recovery, and rebuilding efforts - the Administration is also working to build the long-term resilience of Hawai\u02bbi and making significant investments to prevent another tragedy like this from happening again.\n\nTo mark the one-year anniversary, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell and U.S. Fire Administrator Dr. Lori Moore Merrell traveled to Maui this week to join Chief Federal Response Coordinator Robert Fenton along with State, local, and community leaders to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the wildfires and observe ongoing recovery efforts.\n\nAs President Biden made clear during his visit to Maui last year, the Biden-Harris Administration will be with the people of Maui every step of the way, no matter how long it takes, to recover and rebuild from these unprecedented wildfires. Throughout this long-term recovery and rebuilding effort, the Administration will continue to incorporate the voices and knowledge of the Native Hawaiian Community in respecting and preserving sacred lands, culture, and traditions.\n\nOver the past year, the Administration has provided nearly $385 million dollars in assistance to individuals and households for response and recovery efforts, including nearly $300 million to provide safe housing to displaced survivors with damaged or destroyed homes. Additionally, the Administration has also provided more than $500 million to support debris removal, infrastructure rebuilding, and other emergency protective measures.

Local, state and federal agencies have been working to help Maui residents tackle the arduous process of rebuilding.\n\nA CBS News analysis of satellite imagery shows signs of recovery but widespread damage remains. The imagery shows cleared lots as debris removal progresses, greenery returning and construction of new temporary housing sites for displaced residents.\n\nSatellite images from April and August of 2024 show debris removal in Lahaina. These newer satellite images show cleared lots and visibly less ash and dust coating the town.\n\nSatellite imagery from April 18, 2024, shows greenery coming back in parts of Lahaina - including around the 151-year-old banyan tree that survived the fires.\n\nThe first truck full of residential debris left Lahaina in January and headed toward a temporary debris storage site in West Maui, according to Col. Eric Swenson, recovery field office commander with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Since then, 98 percent of debris from residential properties has been cleared.\n\nThe debris removal process gets residents one step closer to obtaining the crucial permits needed to rebuild their homes.\n\nAround 12,000 Maui residents were displaced by the wildfires, according to Hawaii officials. Thousands of people who lost their homes were put into short-term hotels through a Red Cross program, but more long-term options were needed, Maui County officials said.\n\n\"One of the big challenges is that West Maui in particular is a very close-knit community,\" Swenson said. \"And many of the residents here - this is where they grew up, this is where their services are, their doctors, their friends, their family. Many of them want to get back into their old lives here in West Maui.\"\n\nSatellite imagery shows ongoing construction of two new temporary housing projects in West Maui: the 169-unit Kilohana site and the 450-unit Ka La\u02bbi Ola site.\n\nKilohana, which is funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State of Hawaii, is slated for completion in late October, according to the USACE. Ka La\u02bbi Ola is being built by the State of Hawaii and is adjacent to Kilohana. The first residents are expected to move into Ka La\u02bbi Ola this month, according to Maui County.\n\nSwenson said he expects the construction to continue - although the process will have its challenges. Hawaii officials said the tourism-dependent island has taken a massive financial hit following the fires. Swenson said the urgent housing needs could outpace the number of available contractors.\n\nBut he said he thinks the rebuilding efforts are creating a \"sense of hope and encouragement.\"\n\n\"Whenever we get a lot cleared and I meet the resident out there, the dynamic has changed,\" Swenson said. \"The sorrow, the hopelessness, sometimes it fades away. And what they see on that vacant lot is, they see an opportunity. They see their future in front of them.\"\n\nLayla Ferris\n\nLayla Ferris is a verification producer with CBS News Confirmed.

A young man with a white flower tucked behind his ear sat behind a desk near the door, smiling as he greeted visitors. Hawaiian music played overhead, and a television screen looped images of colorful hibiscus and bright beaches. Two men were \"talking story\" in the waiting area, trading stories of what they each lost in the fire, as they waited their turn to receive the essential services offered here.\n\nThis converted storefront inside a Kahului strip mall is the hub of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, or CNHA, a 23-year-old organization that has become a crucial leader in Maui's recovery from the devastating fires that killed at least 102 people and displaced 12,000.\n\nThe center is divided into stations that address various needs: housing, financial assistance and mental health support. There are FEMA and Red Cross tables, but everything that happens here is led by locals. The staff themselves are Lahaina survivors, some of whom lost their own homes.\n\n\"We created this center as a way to culturally approach the disaster recovery,\" said Kuhio Lewis, the council's CEO. \"The concept here is come in, feel the spirit of aloha, see somebody that you're familiar with, so we can help you through the process.\"\n\nMore than 6,000 families have been helped at the center, but this is only one piece of CNHA's robust recovery project. It financially supports families who take in displaced loved ones, leases apartments for survivors, runs workforce development programs to train people for cleanup and construction jobs, and builds temporary housing for families.\n\nIts work has helped fill the gap between Maui residents and federal and nonprofit agencies from the continental United States who struggled to grasp Hawaii's landscape, culture, and the historical trauma its people already bore.\n\n\"We understand the needs of the community a lot better,\" said Lewis.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with Lewis a few weeks before the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 8, 2023 fires. He discussed what it was like to suddenly receive support from all over the world, how CNHA became one of the most crucial providers of housing for survivors, what he's most proud of, and what still worries him about Maui's long recovery.\n\nHis answers have been edited for clarity and length.\n\n_____\n\nA: We've had over 22,000 donors from all over the world. They were small -- as little as $5. There was a kid from another state who sent us a letter in the mail with $12 cash. He said he recycled cans and wanted to support. That's the stuff you don't forget. Maybe you got a $100,000 check earlier in the week, but that $12 meant a lot for that kid.\n\nThe in-kind donations must have been in the millions. All of the shipping costs for the building supplies. The stoves and microwaves and AC needed for the homes we're building. The warehouse space for donations. School supplies. Everybody is throwing in.\n\nBetween the money we've raised, the money that we've gotten from Hawaii Community Foundation, which has been very supportive of our work, and the money we've gotten from the government, it's over $40 million.\n\nIt's getting harder to raise money. We're still living off of what we raised in the first five months or so. But the money's going to run out at some point. Which is partly why we've pivoted to housing. It has a longer lifespan.\n\n_____\n\nA: When we first launched our resource center, the community was telling us, \"We need housing.\" There were 12,000 individuals that were displaced. That was around 9,000 families that needed someplace to go.\n\nMany survivors were already staying with friends and family. That's very normal in a Hawaii community, where you lean on your friends and family. So we came up with our first program, which was the Host Housing Support Program, where we provided financial help to those that were caretaking for survivors. That was unique.\n\nAs things started to progress, we started renting homes under our organization and subletting them to survivors to minimize the amount of back and forth that would have been required between survivors, who were already going through a lot, and landlords.\n\nOver longer periods of time, the rental market is just too much to sustain. We ultimately landed on, we just have to start building houses. We're building over 60 temporary two-bedroom units. These will serve as dwellings for at least five years.\n\nThe strong community sentiment was that they wanted to stay in West Maui, and they wanted to raise their kids in West Maui. It's all towards the end of helping them repopulate back in Lahaina. While you're going through the steps of rebuilding, at least you have someplace to live. But the idea here is to get them back to full normalcy.\n\n_____\n\nA: Our mission is to advance -- culturally, politically, economically -- Native Hawaiians. And we are doing that, because Native Hawaiians are leading this recovery.\n\nIt hasn't taken us away from our mission, because at the end of the day, we're for a thriving Hawaii. In this moment, I see our organization as Hawaiians helping to uplift Hawaii. This is our homeland. If we're native to this place, we have a responsibility to take care of the people that live here, regardless of their ethnic background.\n\nSometimes we get too caught up in how to serve ourselves in our ethnic groups. That's not who we are as a people, as a culture. It's always been inclusive. And so this has returned us to that. We help everybody. It's the spirit of aloha.\n\n_____\n\nA: One of the key things that I'm most concerned about is Hawaii's fabric.\n\nWhat makes Hawaii unique, compared to anywhere around the world, is the culture. And when you start to see mass exodus of the people, you start to change the fabric of Hawaii. That's what's at stake is the future of who Hawaii is as a people, as a place.\n\nWe've lost thousands already to this fire. They've moved off island, to other states. Even before the fire, we were seeing a mass exodus of families leaving for stability outside of Hawaii because the cost of living was just too high.\n\nWe need to address the housing situation on Maui. And in the end, what happened here has actually fast-tracked that conversation.

Local, state and federal agencies have been working to help Maui residents tackle the arduous process of rebuilding.\n\nA CBS News analysis of satellite imagery shows signs of recovery but widespread damage remains. The imagery shows cleared lots as debris removal progresses, greenery returning and construction of new temporary housing sites for displaced residents.\n\nSatellite images from April and August of 2024 show debris removal in Lahaina. These newer satellite images show cleared lots and visibly less ash and dust coating the town.\n\nSatellite imagery from April 18, 2024, shows greenery coming back in parts of Lahaina - including around the 151-year-old banyan tree that survived the fires.\n\nThe first truck full of residential debris left Lahaina in January and headed toward a temporary debris storage site in West Maui, according to Col. Eric Swenson, recovery field office commander with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Since then, 98 percent of debris from residential properties has been cleared.\n\nThe debris removal process gets residents one step closer to obtaining the crucial permits needed to rebuild their homes.\n\nAround 12,000 Maui residents were displaced by the wildfires, according to Hawaii officials. Thousands of people who lost their homes were put into short-term hotels through a Red Cross program, but more long-term options were needed, Maui County officials said.\n\n\"One of the big challenges is that West Maui in particular is a very close-knit community,\" Swenson said. \"And many of the residents here - this is where they grew up, this is where their services are, their doctors, their friends, their family. Many of them want to get back into their old lives here in West Maui.\"\n\nSatellite imagery shows ongoing construction of two new temporary housing projects in West Maui: the 169-unit Kilohana site and the 450-unit Ka La\u02bbi Ola site.\n\nKilohana, which is funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State of Hawaii, is slated for completion in late October, according to the USACE. Ka La\u02bbi Ola is being built by the State of Hawaii and is adjacent to Kilohana. The first residents are expected to move into Ka La\u02bbi Ola this month, according to Maui County.\n\nSwenson said he expects the construction to continue - although the process will have its challenges. Hawaii officials said the tourism-dependent island has taken a massive financial hit following the fires. Swenson said the urgent housing needs could outpace the number of available contractors.\n\nBut he said he thinks the rebuilding efforts are creating a \"sense of hope and encouragement.\"\n\n\"Whenever we get a lot cleared and I meet the resident out there, the dynamic has changed,\" Swenson said. \"The sorrow, the hopelessness, sometimes it fades away. And what they see on that vacant lot is, they see an opportunity. They see their future in front of them.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Maui_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Maui Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Corps of Engineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volcanic ash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Banyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui_County,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maui County, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maui County, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Urban_Exploration", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Urban Exploration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/08/26/0feab40e-38d8-4342-8206-cd39259959d1/thumbnail/1200x630/e4a4214d0ec80e230dc42a7f0deabef7/cbsn-fusion-maui-releases-list-of-names-of-those-missing-in-lahaina-fire-thumbnail-2239486-640x360.jpg?v=0a0c17d349635d55704afd4e16e28fc6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798881", "eventUri": "eng-9798881", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-04-", "textStart": 952, "textEnd": 960}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Billions of dollars in damage was done.\n\nBut the wildfire took much more than a count of structures or tally of insurance claims can measure. Its sudden and unrelenting surge through Lahaina traumatized survivors, leaving thousands with no home to return to, stealing away stability and leaving in its wake an overwhelming feeling of loss.\n\nThe mourning has been widespread. All of Hawaii share in the sorrow for the lives lost, futures upended and landmarks, homes and businesses destroyed by the fires of Aug. 8.\n\nAs we know now, however, Lahaina's survivors and those connected to them did not give up hope. The outpouring of care, and of determined, coordinated effort to meet survivors' needs, has been incredible, beginning with the extraordinary efforts of the police and firefighters who confronted the fire, evacuating and rescuing survivors. From uncounted individuals who made donations and volunteered their time to help, to the elected officials, including Hawaii's governor and the U.S. president, who pledged and marshalled public support for Lahaina and survivor's needs, the response has been focused and dedicated.\n\nIn the year that's passed, much has been accomplished.\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency workers have cleared nearly 320,000 tons of debris from the burn zone, including almost 34 tons of asbestos and other hazardous substances left behind. Water systems have been restored to a portion of the affected area, and unsafe water advisories have ended. Work continues, and in many cases proceeds ahead of schedule.\n\nSheltering the displaced has loomed above all the many needs. This required the conversion to temporary housing units of thousands of hotel rooms, then procurement of longterm rentals, under pressure, as survivors decide whether to remain in Lahaina or on Maui for the time required to rebuild. This process has involved its own frustrations, with bureaucratic confusion, uncertainty over the extent of aid to be provided and statewide worries about how Hawaii would foot its share of the bill.\n\nThroughout, Hawaii has continued to treat secure housing for Lahaina's displaced as a mandate, and has acted boldly, prevailing on sources both public and private to contribute. Formerly unsheltered Lahaina families and undocumented workers have been helped despite a dearth of federal funding, and steps have been taken to reduce the count of short-term rentals in West Maui so that homes can be made available. More than 1,200 transitional homes are currently under construction, and just Tuesday, Gov. Josh Green announced a $5 million partnership with Matson to transport housing materials to Maui. The extent and success of this effort must be recognized.\n\n\"The wildfires happened on Maui, but affected all of us across the state very deeply. It was clear from the very beginning that we would need all who are able to help to do so,\" Green stated. Hawaii has responded to this call. Now, all throughout the state must stand by Lahaina, prepared to provide the aid and care needed to see recovery through.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu_Star-Advertiser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asbestos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dangerous goods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Green_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Green (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Maui_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Maui Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matson,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matson, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_CTY-lahaina-banyan-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798881", "eventUri": "eng-9798881", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 1190, "textEnd": 1196}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

But it was pleasant and peaceful, and a long way from the cartel violence of Mexico that his family escaped nearly three decades ago.\n\nHe became a chef, serving the flow of tourists that propelled the local economy, and found a home a short walk from the shimmering waters of the Pacific Ocean in the historic town of Lahaina. He got married, had four daughters, got divorced and found love again.\n\nThen last year, the fires came, consuming his home and claiming his job, and he was confronted with a choice: Stay or go? His mother invited him to return to Mexico, but he said he would never raise his daughters amid the violence of the drug trade that overshadows his homeland.\n\nEventually, he was drawn to Las Vegas, a place that has attracted so many Hawaiians in recent years that it has been called the Ninth Island. These days, he works as a cook at the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel & Casino, dreaming of his lost paradise and worrying about the toll on his family.\n\n\"I lived a block from the beach in Lahaina,\" Mr. Perez, 42, said. \"My daughters would go to the beach, they would go shopping by themselves. I didn't have to worry. Here, there's a lot of danger for my girls.\"\n\nOne year after a wildfire incinerated Lahaina, killing 102 people in the deadliest fire in the United States in more than a century, residents on the island of Maui are struggling to find work and housing. Some are still living in hotels, while others cannot find apartments they can afford.\n\nThousands of other people, like Mr. Perez, have picked up and left in search of better economic opportunities. But they have discovered new hardships and not escaped their trauma.\n\nMr. Perez's four daughters are all in therapy in Las Vegas, processing both the psychological wounds of witnessing the town they loved being wiped away and leaving their little piece of paradise, while also trying to fit in at new schools.\n\nOne of his daughters, Nicole Perez, 15, said she missed everything about Lahaina -- the beaches, the trees, the food, the quiet roads. She is getting ready to start 10th grade in Las Vegas and going through culture shock.\n\n\"It looks miserable, it looks depressing,\" she said of her new city. \"Nothing looks healthy at all.\"\n\nShe said she appreciated the diversity of the people in Las Vegas, but otherwise felt unsafe. \"All the cars drive too fast and animals get run over many, many times,\" she said \"In Lahaina, you could just walk on the road and nobody would hit you.\"\n\nThe Lahaina diaspora, numbering in the thousands, now stretches from the Philippines to Honduras and through the continental United States, especially along the West Coast.\n\nFamilies that were tight knit on the islands are now scattered about, with some people staying on Maui and others moving to the mainland, leaving sadness and loneliness in their wake.\n\nThe diaspora involves more than the residents who lost their homes. Other Maui residents whose seaside livelihoods were tied to Lahaina or who grew worried about the next possible disaster in an era of climate change have also joined the exodus.\n\nRon Proctor, 71, lived in Lahaina for 13 years, working in restaurants for a few years before retiring -- at least from that line of work. Mr. Proctor has a long white beard down to his chest, and for years was the community's Santa Claus at restaurants and strip malls and on boat cruises.\n\n\"Basically, the whole west side,\" he said. \"Anyone who needed a Santa Claus.\"\n\nOn the day of the fire, he barely escaped with his life, he said, and saw the charred body of someone who had tried to flee on a bicycle. For months afterward, he lived in a luxury resort paid for by the government and kept looking for permanent housing, a pursuit he came to believe was \"useless.\"\n\nA few months ago, he packed up and moved to Napa, Calif., near his daughter and grandchildren, and found a cheap apartment through the Veterans Affairs Department. His few belongings that survived the fire fit in one backpack, and he has been scouring garage sales to stock his new apartment.\n\n\"It had been a good run and I just saw no way to sustain what I had,\" he said.\n\nWhile the aftermath of the fire has affected residents of every background, including immigrants like Mr. Perez and people who grew up on the mainland and came to Maui to surf and ended up staying, the tragedy has been especially painful for Native Hawaiians.\n\nKuhio Lewis, the chief executive for the Council For Native Hawaiian Advancement, said the fires had exacerbated a longtime exodus of Native Hawaiians because of economic hardship. In recent decades, as tourism overtook agriculture as the state's dominant industry, rampant development and an influx of wealthy people from the mainland drove up the cost of living, forcing Native Hawaiians to seek economic opportunities and more affordable housing elsewhere.\n\nCensus data from 2020 showed that for the first time, a higher share of Native Hawaiians, about 53 percent, were living on the mainland rather than in Hawaii.\n\n\"We were taught that chasing the American dream and moving away from Hawaii was 'a better life,' as if living in paradise and living in our homeland and being Hawaiian was not good enough,\" said Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, a Hawaiian cultural teacher and community leader on Oahu. \"We are a minor minority in our own homeland.\"\n\nJosh Green, the governor of Hawaii, said in an interview that data he had seen from the Federal Emergency Management Agency showed that about 10 percent of Lahaina's population of 12,000 residents had left the island.\n\nThe University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization estimates that Maui has lost 3,000 to 4,000 people over the last year, a number that includes people who were not displaced by the fire but left anyway and undocumented residents affected by the fire who wouldn't necessarily show up in official data because they did not seek out government aid. Carl Bonham, the organization's executive director, said he considered the estimate to be conservative.\n\nMr. Green said that while the exodus of people was concerning, many were immigrants who were there seasonally and left to find work elsewhere.\n\n\"When their jobs went away or their rent went through the roof, many people went and found a different place to live,\" he said. \"Most of the people who are Hawaiian or longtime Hawaii residents are staying.\"\n\nBrett Moore, who has Native Hawaiian ancestry, decided to stay on Maui, where he grew up. But he recently helped his parents move to South Carolina, near Mr. Moore's brother.\n\nThey had lived on Maui for 49 years, moving there in the early 1970s during a renaissance of Hawaiian culture that drew many families back to the island. But they saw the chance to sell their house at an inflated value because home prices soared after the fire. And they worried about the chance of another disaster, and what the future of Maui would bring -- a sense, Mr. Moore said, \"that this place that has been so familiar for so long is no longer familiar.\"\n\nHis parents sold their house for nearly $1 million, bought a new one in South Carolina for about $300,000 and paid off all of their debts.\n\n\"Now they are living in a place they don't want to be living at, in a state they don't want to be in,\" he said, \"but they love family and they love finally being out of debt.\"\n\nMany people who left are hoping to return once the rebuilding process begins and Lahaina regains its economic footing.\n\nMariana Pantoja, 37, had lived in Lahaina for only a few months before the fire, but it was enough time for her to fall in love with the place. Many of her relatives from Mexico were already living in Lahaina, and she found work as a maid at a hotel. \"I used to say, 'This is work?' she said. \"Cleaning hotel rooms with a beautiful view of the ocean, for me, is not work.\"\n\nShe never wanted to leave, but her boyfriend, deeply traumatized by the devastation of the wildfire, convinced her that they should move to Chicago, where she has family. Ever since, she said, she has been arguing with her boyfriend about whether to return.\n\n\"He said to stop talking about going back, but it's been a year and I will not spend another winter here,\" she said.\n\nIn recent days, she quit her job at a food factory in Chicago, where she worked an overnight shift moving boxes of hot sauce and cooking oils onto pallets. She flew back to Maui last week to look for work and housing. \"We lived there for a short time but the time we lived there was the best and we were very happy,\" she said.\n\nAngus McKelvey, a state senator who represents Maui, said the state government hadn't done enough to keep people in Lahaina. He said he believed there should be a large assistance program, modeled on the federal government's pandemic response, to stem the flight of people from Maui.\n\nA year after the fire, leaders like Mr. McKelvey are concerned that even more people will leave, pointing to a recent survey by the Hawaii State Rural Health Association that showed that nearly half of the fire survivors still on the island were thinking about moving away.\n\nHe worried, too, that the exodus would permanently alter the character of his community.\n\n\"Local people leave, wealthy people from all over the world come in,\" Mr. McKelvey said. \"That is the palpable fear.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui",

A young man with a white flower behind his ear sat at a desk near the door, smiling as he greeted visitors. Hawaiian music played and a television screen showed images of colorful hibiscus and bright beaches. Two men \"talked stories\" in the waiting room, swapping tales of what they both lost in the fire as they waited their turn to receive the essential services offered here.\n\nThis converted store in a Kahului shopping center is the centerpiece of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, or CNHA, a 23-year-old organization that has grown into a crucial leader in Maui's recovery of the devastating fires that killed at least 102 people and displaced 12,000.\n\nThe center is divided into stations that address different needs: housing, financial aid, and mental health. There are FEMA and Red Cross tables, but everything that happens here is run by locals. The staff themselves are Lahaina survivors, some of whom lost their own homes.\n\n\"We created this center as a way to approach disaster relief culturally,\" said Kuhio Lewis, the council's CEO. \"The concept here is: Come in, feel the spirit of aloha, meet someone you know, and we can help you through the process.\"\n\nMore than 6,000 families have been helped at the center, but this is just one part of CNHA's robust recovery effort. It provides financial support to families taking in displaced loved ones, rents apartments for survivors, runs workforce development programs to train people for cleanup and construction jobs, and builds temporary housing for families.\n\nHer work has bridged the gap between Maui residents and federal and non-profit organizations on the mainland United States who have struggled to understand the landscape, culture and historical trauma of Hawaii's people.\n\n\"We understand the needs of the community much better,\" Lewis said.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with Lewis a few weeks before the first anniversary of the fires on Aug. 8, 2023. He discussed what it was like to suddenly receive support from around the world, how CNHA became a major provider of housing for survivors, what he's most proud of and what still worries him about Maui's long recovery.\n\nHis answers have been edited for clarity and length.\n\n_____\n\nA: We've had over 22,000 donors from all over the world. They were small -- as little as $5. We had a kid from out of state who sent us a letter with $12 in cash. He said he recycled cans and wanted to support. That's the stuff you don't forget. You may have gotten a check for $100,000 earlier in the week, but that $12 meant a lot to that kid.\n\nThe in-kind donations must have been in the millions. All the shipping costs for the building materials. The stoves and microwaves and air conditioning that go into the houses we build. The storage space for donations. School supplies. Everybody pitches in.\n\nIf we take the money we raised, the money we got from the Hawaii Community Foundation, which has been a tremendous supporter of our work, and the money we got from the government, the total is over $40 million.\n\nIt's getting harder and harder to raise money. We're still living off what we raised in the first five months or so. But the money runs out at some point. That's partly why we've moved to housing. It has a longer lifespan.\n\n_____\n\nA: When we first launched our resource center, the community told us, \"We need housing.\" There were 12,000 individuals who were displaced. That was about 9,000 families who needed somewhere to go.\n\nMany survivors were already staying with friends and family. That's a very common thing in a community in Hawaii, where you lean on your friends and family. So we came up with our first program, the Host Housing Support Program, where we provided financial assistance to those who were caring for survivors. That was unique.\n\nAs things progressed, we began renting homes through our organization and subletting them to survivors, in order to minimize the amount of back and forth emails between survivors, who were already struggling, and landlords.\n\nLong term, the rental market is just too big to sustain. We finally came to the conclusion, we just have to start building houses. We are building over 60 temporary two-bedroom units. These will serve as homes for at least five years.\n\nThe strong sense of the community was that they wanted to stay in West Maui and raise their children in West Maui. It's all towards the end of helping them get back to Lahaina. While you're going through the steps of rebuilding, at least you have a place to live. But the idea here is to get them back to normal.\n\n_____\n\nA: Our mission is to advance Native Hawaiians -- culturally, politically, economically. And we do that because Native Hawaiians are leading this recovery.\n\nIt hasn't taken us away from our mission, because ultimately we are for a thriving Hawaii. Right now, I see our organization as Hawaiians helping to lift Hawaii up. This is our homeland. If we were born here, we have a responsibility to take care of the people who live here, regardless of their ethnic background.\n\nSometimes we get too caught up in how to serve ourselves in our ethnic groups. That's not who we are as a people, as a culture. It's always been inclusive. And so this has brought us back to that. We help everyone. It's the spirit of aloha.\n\n_____\n\nA: One of the main things I'm most concerned about is the fabric of Hawaii.\n\nWhat makes Hawaii unique, compared to anywhere else in the world, is the culture. And when you start to see mass exodus of people, you start to change the fabric of Hawaii. That's what's at stake: the future of who Hawaii is as a people, as a place.\n\nWe have already lost thousands of people to this fire. They have moved off the island to other states. Even before the fire, we were seeing a mass exodus of families moving to stability outside of Hawaii because the cost of living was just too high.\n\nWe need to address the housing situation on Maui. And ultimately what happened here accelerated that conversation. Now you're starting to see the policies that are going to change that trajectory.\n\nA: It meant a lot to turn over the keys to this young family that had lost everything. I went to (the 50-unit development in Kahului) recently to check on the progress of the homes, and the kids were playing in the yard. They had made their own little makeshift pool with a tarp, and they were just playing with water.\n\nWe have now been able to hand out keys to a number of families and we will continue to do so.\n\n_____\n\nThe Associated Press's coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through AP's partnership with The Conversation US, with funding from the Lilly Endowment Inc.

PC: JD Pells / Maui Now\n\nOn the eve of the anniversary of the 2023 wildfires that destroyed 3,071 homes, two more families from Lahaina received keys to temporary homes at the La'ik\u016b housing site.\n\n\"This was number six,\" said Carol Lee Ah Puck, referring to the number of times she has moved since the wildfire. She anticipates this being her final tenancy. \"I have everything I need, for now, at least until we start rebuilding.\"\n\nLa'ik\u016b, which means 'a calming place,' is a public-private funded temporary housing project located along Lahainaluna Road, consisting of 16 two-bedroom, one-bath units, each measuring 560 square feet. The first two families began moving in on July 23.\n\n\"While La'ik\u016b is a relatively small project, every unit that we develop means one more family will have a more stable housing environment and a foundation to help rebuild their lives and continue healing,\" said Governor Josh Green, M.D.\n\nThe $3.9 million development is a partnership between the Hawai\u02bbi Department of Transportation (HDOT), the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA), the Hawai\u02bbi Community Foundation (HCF) Maui Strong Fund and the Hawai\u02bbi Department of Education (DOE).\n\nThe homes are being built on approximately two acres of land that was previously acquired by the HDOT as part of the Lahaina Bypass project. According to HDOT Director Ed Sniffen, who spoke at a press conference on the property on Wednesday, once tenants move out and into longterm housing, the land will convert to teacher housing for the DOE.\n\nThe identical, modular homes were constructed assembly-style by HPM Building Supply on Hawai\u02bbi Island and come with standing seam, metal roofs. According to HPM, four homes are being shipped every two weeks to the development. Four additional units will be completed on Aug. 9, and the remaining eight units will be delivered by September.\n\nMonthly rent for homes in La'ik\u016b is $1,750, which tenants can pay via personal funds, rental assistance from FEMA, or insurance proceeds. Water and sewer services, up to $75 per month as well as trash removal, are included for each unit. Family dogs and cats of up to 50 pounds are welcomed in the neighborhood.\n\nThere is no income limit for applicants, whose eligibility for tenancy will be verified as wildfire-impacted by the CNHA K\u0101ko\u02bbo Maui Resource Center. Families who may have temporarily relocated to other islands are also eligible to apply. Units must be occupied by a minimum of two, or up to a maximum of five people. Parking is limited to two vehicles per unit. Street parking is not allowed. Applications for La\u02bbik\u016b may be submitted online via helpingmaui.org or by visiting the CNHA K\u0101ko\u02bbo Maui Resource Center at Maui Mall during regular business hours.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen also outlined the current status of permits in the impact zone.\n\nPer his summary, 20 families are rebuilding their homes in the impact zone now, another 48 permits have been approved, and 130 others are in the queue.", "source": {"uri": "mauinow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maui Now | Hawaii News  |  Local Maui News and Information | Hawaii News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahainaluna_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lahainaluna High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sniffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ed Sniffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_State_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii State Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Green_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Green (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(island)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii (island)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii (island)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Native Hawaiians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bissen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Bissen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://media.mauinow.com/file/mauinow/2024/08/laiku-housing-lahaina-governor-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798881", "eventUri": "eng-9798881", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 769, "textEnd": 776}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1897, "textEnd": 1903}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

On Monday, Gov. Josh Green added more details in a television interview with KHON, indicating the state would contribute \"close to 20%\" of the settlement amount, or about $800 million.\n\nThe proposed settlement would resolve more than 600 lawsuits filed on behalf of victims of the fires, which destroyed much of Lahaina and killed 102 people a year ago Thursday. The agreement is contingent on resolving claims of insurance companies that are seeking reimbursement for billions of dollars in claims for property loss.\n\nA hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in Maui court to address that issue.\n\nAlthough the amount paid by each party under the tentative settlement is confidential under a mediation order, some parties have begun to reveal how much they will pay.\n\nThese contributions total approximately $3.7 billion, or about 90% of the total, leaving the relatively small sum of about $337 million to be picked up by other defendants participating in the global settlement. They include Maui County, Spectrum Oceanic, Charter Communications, Cincinnati Bell, Hawaiian Telcom and several entities affiliated with West Maui Land Co. and Launiupoko Water Co.\n\nNone of these entities have said how much they will pay toward the proposed global settlement, and a settlement term sheet filed in Maui state court does not say how much each will pay.\n\nA critical question for Maui taxpayers is how much the county will have to pay.\n\nMaui County previously pledged to pay $10 million into the state-sponsored One Ohana settlement fund for personal injury victims and families of people killed in the fires. And according to people familiar with the settlement, the cash-strapped county won't be required to fork out any more.\n\nIn exchange, the county will drop a lawsuit it brought against HECO just weeks after the Lahaina fire arguing that the utility was to blame.\n\nTo pay to rebuild infrastructure, the county will pursue federal disaster relief fund grant money instead of damages from HECO, sources said.\n\nA cause and origin report being produced by the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms has still not been made public.\n\nEven if that report were to show Maui bore significant blame for the fires, it wouldn't necessarily follow that the county should have to pay a proportionally large contribution to the settlement fund, Green said. If a particular party doesn't have the resources, it simply can't pay more, the governor said.\n\n\"People love the idea that the report will show who is 'guilty,' and therefore they will pay a fortune. That's not how the world works,\" Green told Civil Beat on Wednesday. \"The report can show what happened, but the resources are still finite.\"\n\n\"No one that we were working with was trying to avoid responsibility, which was extraordinary,\" Green added. \"Just people said they didn't have enough money.\"\n\nCounty officials declined to comment on Wednesday, citing confidentiality provisions of the mediation that led to the settlement.\n\n\"The County is subject to the confidentiality and privilege provisions of the parties' Mediation Agreement,\" according to a statement sent to Civil Beat Wednesday attributed to the Maui Corporation Counsel's office. \"The County will not disclose information protected by those provisions at this time, including but not limited to the parties' respective contributions or credits to the Aggregate Settlement Amount.\"\n\nAlso unclear is precisely where the state's contribution will come from.\n\nGreen's office declined to provide details, saying it plans to brief the Legislature next week.\n\nHowever, on Monday, the governor told KHON that the state plans to draw from insurance proceeds, as well as proceeds of a settlement worth more than $900 million paid by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and three U.S.-based subsidiaries of French pharmaceutical company Sanofi related to the drug Plavix.\n\nGreen said the state's contribution would be close to 20% of the total, which would be about $807 million. However, it was unclear whether that was in addition to $65 million the state has pledged to the One Ohana fund. If so, that would bring the state's total contribution to $872 million, the same as what Kamehameha Schools has pledged.\n\nGreen alluded to the two parties putting up the same amount during Monday's television interview saying KS's settlement pledge made it an \"equal partner to the state.\"\n\nThe Hawaiian Electric companies' $1.99 billion includes $75 million previously pledged to the One Ohana fund, the company said when announcing its decision. Precisely where this money will come from is not clear.\n\nHEI's market value was $1.69 billion on Wednesday, according to Yahoo Finance. And while the company has been able to raise cash at fair rates by borrowing against accounts receivable, a battered bond rating has made issuing traditional corporate debt a costly proposition.\n\n\"HEI and Hawaiian Electric are working closely with their financial advisors to develop a financing plan for their settlement contribution and intend to finance the settlement payments through a mix of debt, common equity, equity-linked securities, or other potential options, although there can be no assurance at this time as to the availability or terms of any such financing,\" the company said when announcing the proposed settlement.\n\nThe company is expected to share more details during its second quarter earnings call on Friday.\n\nKamehameha Schools' contribution is contingent on an agreement being crafted between Kamehameha, which is the state's largest private landowner, and the state of Hawaii and Maui County. In an email message on Wednesday, Jack Wong, the chief executive of the organization, said that KS is asking the state and county to \"support laws to protect communities from wildfire and other natural disasters, including establishing clear, defensible standards of care for property owners.\"\n\nKS owns more than 1,000 acres near Lahaina that could be used to rebuild homes and businesses and provide Native Hawaiian cultural resources. A question is whether the state and county will promise to provide the infrastructure and regulatory entitlements and permits needed to develop the property. KS wants government promises memorialized in a \"memorandum of agreement.\"\n\n\"An essential condition for KS entering this settlement is the assurance by the State and County that they remain committed to Lahaina's restoration,\" Wong wrote. \"The MOA will affirm this and seek their commitment to adopt culture-based, community-driven plans; restore cultural and historical places (e.g., Mokuhinia and Moku\u02bbula); build infrastructure (e.g., R-1 water line); create community gathering places; establish a learning center (with a kaiapuni preschool and K-12 kula kaiapuni facilities); and financially support KS' restorative development projects so they can become financially viable.\"\n\nIn addition, Wong wrote, KS' settlement payment will have to be approved by the Hawaii probate court and the Hawaii attorney general. As a charitable trust established by Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop for the benefit of Native Hawaiian children, organization expenditures for purposes outside of its core mission must be approved by the court and by the attorney general as the legal protector of the public interest.\n\nCivil Beat reporters Marcel Honore and Kevin Dayton contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri":

It added up quickly.\n\nMicah Kane, president and CEO of the Hawaii Community Foundation, revealed nearly $200 million was raised for Lahaina.\n\nThe Hawaii Community Foundation instantly teed up existing island-specific fundraising that started back in 2018.\n\n\"We started strong funds in each of the counties,\" said Kane. \"A lot of our resources are going towards shelter and lodging. Over $50 million just in housing alone. Direct financial assistance, which really helps with filling gaps allowing families to put the resources where needed, over $25 million there.\"\n\nOnce the fires hit, the Maui Strong Fund we know today was already set up to coordinate donation intake and grant output to help the community.\n\nJust over half of the money raised was distributed -- $110 million through 200 community organizations.\n\nThe Council for Native Hawaiian vancement is one of Maui Strong Fund's biggest nonprofit recipients, plus received thousands of direct donations as well.\n\n\"CNHA has raised around $40 million. We've spent just over $15 million on building homes, and we've probably spent another five or six [million] on rental programs to help families stabilize,\" said Kuhio Lewis, Council for Native Hawaiian vancement.\n\n\"And we even have our workforce programs, our resource centers. We're managing the distribution of all the large-scale things that have come in, like furniture,\" Kane added.\n\nAmerican Red Cross, another major recipient of heartfelt donations, saw more than $90 million in monetary, goods and services, donations pour in.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Hawaiians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Gifts_in_Kind", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Gifts in Kind", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Free_Donations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Free Donations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Philanthropy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Millions-of-dollars-raised-for-Lahaina-but-where-did-the.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798881", "eventUri": "eng-9798881", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Log in now to continue reading.\n\nLAHAINA >> Shelley Dahilig takes two ti leaves, ties a square knot and slips it around her toes -- she needs an anchor as she joins Malu i Ka 'Ulu in making a 600-foot lei to remember her Auntie Melvamay \"Honey Girl\" Benjamin and all the other lives lost in Maui wildfires a year ago.\n\nDahilig twists the pieces away and then pulls them close to make a rope. When she comes to the end, she will look away and add another piece. If it breaks, Dahilig will add it back in, and it will be made stronger by its attachment to the other pieces.\n\nThe town of Lahaina was like that too. It had many parts, and each was needed to make a whole. The loss of at least 102 lives in the nation's deadliest fire in a century frayed the tightly woven community, whose rallying cry has always been \"We Are Lahaina.\"\n\nHow can Lahaina still be Lahaina if even one soul is missing?\n\nDalana Kaneakua, who works as a crisis counselor for Malu i Ka 'Ulu, the organizer of the lei-making effort, said all of the formal events and more intimate gatherings planned for today show that those lost are not forgotten, and the memory of those who died is creating a lasting legacy.\n\nMalu i Ka 'Ulu today will place a lei on each of the 102 white crosses rooted into the hillside above the still-scarred Lahaina Wildfire Impact Zone. The organization, which is dedicated to promoting mental health and self-healing for Maui residents, will then connect all the crosses with the long lei that Dahilig and others made. The act symbolizes the unity of those who died and of the Lahaina survivors who carry on in their absence.\n\nKaneakua, whose longtime rental burned down in the fire, has had to temporarily move out of Lahaina, but she hopes to return one day to the small town with tremendous mana.\n\n\"I knew the fire victims as 'everyday faces.' A lot of them worked in Lahaina town and I would see them and talk story,\" she said. \"You don't put a value on those kinds of little moments until they are gone and then it all comes back.\"\n\nEach of the 102 played a role in the diverse community, which was once the seat of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and attracted people from all over the world who came to work in the sugar and pineapple plantations. More commonly, Lahaina residents now work in the visitor industry or in jobs aimed at helping their home recover from one of Hawaii's worst natural disasters.\n\nThey took a chance on Maui\n\nMany of the fire victims were born and raised on Maui, but some like Laurie Allen, 65, chose the town. Perry Allen, her husband and well-known artist, said the couple moved to Lahaina in 2010 -- a goal that they worked toward for two years.\n\n\"We were still basically newlyweds. We were married about a little over a year before the fire, but we had known each other for 20 years,\" he said. \"'La La,' that was what I called her, got me to travel. After visiting the different islands of Hawaii several times, we both decided to take a chance and move to Maui, the island we were most drawn to. We loved island living and could not imagine living any other lifestyle or anywhere else.\"\n\nLaurie Perry, who worked at Imua Physical Therapy, was at home during the fire, while Perry Allen was working 15 miles away. He said he called to tell her to evacuate, but she delayed to help their elderly landlord and the woman's son.\n\n\"They were in shock and having a difficult time leaving the property. She waited far too long to evacuate,\" he said.\"She was a hero without a doubt.\"\n\nWhen a fallen tree blocked Laurie Allen's exit, she tried to get to safety by running 100 yards through a wall of flames. She was rescued, but died Sept. 29 at Oahu's Straub Medical Center.\n\nPerry Allen has not left Oahu, where he is finishing up a mountain of paperwork and other fire-related tasks. He said he doesn't know if or when he will return to Maui as he dreads seeing it in its present state and the lack of housing is daunting. But he has faith in Lahaina's people.\n\n\"Their love for the land and each other -- that's not going to falter. They are amazing people,\" he said. \"We loved it. It was our home. We lost almost a dozen people just in our neighborhood. I didn't lose just my wife.\"\n\nDiversity of the victims\n\nMany of the fallen were Asians of Filipino ancestry, as was much of the 12,702-person community.\n\nAlmost 61% of the victims were seniors over the age of 65. Seven of the victims came from the Hale Mahaolu Eono independent-living apartment complex on Lahainaluna Road, including Buddy Jantoc, 79, a well-known musician who was one of the first Lahaina fire victims identified.\n\nJantoc's granddaughter Keshia Alakai still remembers his last visit to Oahu for her daughter Ipo's keiki luau.\n\n\"I had the baby luau July 29 (2023). He literally went home on Aug. 4,\" she said tearfully. \"I was trying to keep him here longer because it was so hectic and I only got to spend a few days with him. He was my papa and we were close. But he had shows to do.\"\n\nDuring that trip Jantoc, who in his heyday as a bass guitarist had played alongside Carlos Santana and George Benson, gave Keshia's husband Kaipo Alakai a Washburn guitar. It's finish is worn from spending a lot of time in capable hands.\n\n\"He had plenty musical instruments. He could play anything.\" Kaipo Alakai said. \"This is the only instrument left of his. It's a little hard to play yet. It will stay in the family. So much memories, a lot of it was good memories.\"\n\nThe average age of the fire victims was 65. Some 36% of them were between 25 and 64 years old; there were three children who died, ages 7, 11, and 14.\n\nSome couples died together as did some families. The youngest wildfire victim, Tony Takafua, 7, died with his mother Salote Tone, 39, and grandparents Fa'aoso Tone, 70, and Malui'fonua Tone, 73, as the Tongan family fled the flames.\n\nHolly Tone, the youngest child of Malui'fonua and Fa'aoso Tone, said in an email that her nephew Takafua was an only child, but did not lack for cousins.\n\n\"He was kind, gentle, and like any other 7 year old -- loud. His laugh was infectious,\" Tone said. \"You could hear him playing from way down the street, you could hear him singing from the next room, and his favorite word to yell was 'Mom.' He filled our home with laughter and love and we miss him every day.\"\n\nShe said \"(our sister) knew how to show up for us and was there for every birthday, every celebration, every graduation, even if it was from kindergarten. We will always remember her love for us.\"\n\nTone recalls that her mother and father were inseparable. \"They moved to Hawaii together, they ate together, they took their medication at the same time, they farmed together, they watched their grandchildren together, our parent did everything together.\n\n\"We were so loved by them and so fortunate to grow up with a mom and dad who cared so deeply and were there for us so consistently,\" she said. \"All we hope to do is carry their legacy of love.\"\n\nA piece of artwork with four intertwining circles has been erected at the crosses to pay homage to the Tone family and to the strong family bonds that give Lahaina an edge over other small towns.\n\nMill Camp hit hard\n\nMany of the victims were longtime community members, including Donna Gomes, 71, whose ties to Lahaina go back some seven generations. She was living in her grandmother's house in Kuhua Camp, also known as Mill Camp because it initially housed Pioneer Mill Co. sugar workers. The neighborhood, which was more than a century old and had narrow, overcrowded streets, lost 43 residents, the most of any community in Lahaina.\n\nGomes' brother Shayne Kahahane recalls that Gomes was the kind of big sister that would \"defend me all the time. She was rough and tough. We all grew up with big hearts and caring and stuff like that, but we were also proud and pretty defensive.\" Kahahane said Gomes, who retired from the MPD public safety aide at the Lahaina Police Station in 2014, had been planning to visit Las Vegas to celebrate her 72nd birthday.\n\nHe lives near the crosses and often visits to pay his respects to Gomes and others he knew. Kahahane estimates he knew 75% of those who perished and considers about nine of them ohana even if \"we weren't blood-related.\"\n\n\"It's a special community. It's so small that everyone knows each other,\" he said. \"We party together. We celebrate together. We rejoice together. We mourn together.\"\n\nBut he said he isn't planning on visiting the crosses today.\n\n\"I don't want to be crying with everyone,\" he said. \"I'd rather go to the boat ramp. The Molokai people who brought in supplies when the town was locked down are going to be there. What they did meant a lot to this community, and I want to thank them.\"\n\n'So tragic'\n\nDahilig, who lives in Wailuku, said she hasn't felt strong enough to visit Lahaina since the fires. She hopes the mana that she wove into the long ti-leaf lei will carry her love to Benjamin, who also was her godmother, and acted like a surrogate mother. Born on Molokai, Benjamin had worked for Hawaiian Telcom until retiring to Lahaina with her partner, Edward Sato, 76, who also died in the fire.\n\n\"She was such a nice local lady -- never leave the house without telling each other that you love them and always giving everyone a honi and a hug,\" Dahilig said tearfully. \"It's not that I have things left that I didn't say; it's just that she was such a big part of my life. There's a really big hole in my heart. Stupid fire. So tragic.\"\n\nDahilig, who is an ICU nurse and was working at Maui Memorial last year on Aug. 8, still remembers bracing for the hospital to fill up.\n\n\"The amount of people that we did not see come in, it was very sad,\" she said. \"I kind of likened it to 9/11 when I was a baby nurse. I remember turning on the TV and seeing all those physicians and all the personnel waiting for people and all the ambulances to come. Then there's that empty feeling that you want to help, and you couldn't help. We found out about auntie a couple of weeks after the fire.\"\n\nNine events are planned on Maui to mark the first anniversary of the Aug. 8 wildfires:\n\n>> Paddle Out from 8 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Thursday at Hanakaoo Beach Park, Lahaina\n\n>> Upcountry Aloha Luncheon from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursday at the Mayor Hannibal Tavares Community Center, Pukalani\n\n>> Lahaina memorial from 5 to 9 p.m. Thursday at the Lahaina Civic Center\n\n>> \"Aloha for Kupuna\" gathering from 9 a.m. to noon Friday at the Lahaina Civic Center\n\n>> Puana Aloha no Lahaina \"Concert for Lahaina\" from 6 to 9 p.m. Friday at the Lahaina Civic Center\n\n>> \"Ka Malu 'Ulu o Lele,\" a performance on the history of Lahaina by Kamehameha Schools Kapalama fifth graders at H.P.

He got married, had four daughters, got divorced and found love again.\n\nThen last year, the fires came, consuming his home and claiming his job, and he was confronted with a choice: Stay or go? His mother invited him to return to Mexico, but he said he would never raise his daughters amid the violence of the drug trade that overshadows his homeland.\n\nEventually, he was drawn to Las Vegas, a place that has attracted so many Hawaiians in recent years that it has been called the Ninth Island. These days, he works as a cook at the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel & Casino, dreaming of his lost paradise and worrying about the toll on his family.\n\n\"I lived a block from the beach in Lahaina,\" Mr. Perez, 42, said. \"My daughters would go to the beach, they would go shopping by themselves.

A young man with a white flower tucked behind his ear sat behind a desk near the door, smiling as he greeted visitors. Hawaiian music played overhead, and a television screen looped images of colorful hibiscus and bright beaches. Two men were \"talking story\" in the waiting area, trading stories of what they each lost in the fire, as they waited their turn to receive the essential services offered here.\n\nThis converted storefront inside a Kahului strip mall is the hub of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, or CNHA, a 23-year-old organization that has become a crucial leader in Maui's recovery from the devastating fires that killed at least 102 people and displaced 12,000.\n\nThe center is divided into stations that address various needs: housing, financial assistance and mental health support. There are FEMA and Red Cross tables, but everything that happens here is led by locals. The staff themselves are Lahaina survivors, some of whom lost their own homes.\n\n\"We created this center as a way to culturally approach the disaster recovery,\" said Kuhio Lewis, the council's CEO. \"The concept here is come in, feel the spirit of aloha, see somebody that you're familiar with, so we can help you through the process.\"\n\nMore than 6,000 families have been helped at the center, but this is only one piece of CNHA's robust recovery project. It financially supports families who take in displaced loved ones, leases apartments for survivors, runs workforce development programs to train people for cleanup and construction jobs, and builds temporary housing for families.\n\nIts work has helped fill the gap between Maui residents and federal and nonprofit agencies from the continental United States who struggled to grasp Hawaii's landscape, culture, and the historical trauma its people already bore.\n\n\"We understand the needs of the community a lot better,\" said Lewis.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with Lewis a few weeks before the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 8, 2023 fires. He discussed what it was like to suddenly receive support from all over the world, how CNHA became one of the most crucial providers of housing for survivors, what he's most proud of, and what still worries him about Maui's long recovery.\n\nHis answers have been edited for clarity and length.\n\n_____\n\nA: We've had over 22,000 donors from all over the world. They were small -- as little as $5. There was a kid from another state who sent us a letter in the mail with $12 cash. He said he recycled cans and wanted to support. That's the stuff you don't forget. Maybe you got a $100,000 check earlier in the week, but that $12 meant a lot for that kid.\n\nThe in-kind donations must have been in the millions. All of the shipping costs for the building supplies. The stoves and microwaves and AC needed for the homes we're building. The warehouse space for donations. School supplies. Everybody is throwing in.\n\nBetween the money we've raised, the money that we've gotten from Hawaii Community Foundation, which has been very supportive of our work, and the money we've gotten from the government, it's over $40 million.\n\nIt's getting harder to raise money. We're still living off of what we raised in the first five months or so. But the money's going to run out at some point. Which is partly why we've pivoted to housing. It has a longer lifespan.\n\n_____\n\nA: When we first launched our resource center, the community was telling us, \"We need housing.\" There were 12,000 individuals that were displaced. That was around 9,000 families that needed someplace to go.\n\nMany survivors were already staying with friends and family. That's very normal in a Hawaii community, where you lean on your friends and family. So we came up with our first program, which was the Host Housing Support Program, where we provided financial help to those that were caretaking for survivors. That was unique.\n\nAs things started to progress, we started renting homes under our organization and subletting them to survivors to minimize the amount of back and forth that would have been required between survivors, who were already going through a lot, and landlords.\n\nOver longer periods of time, the rental market is just too much to sustain. We ultimately landed on, we just have to start building houses. We're building over 60 temporary two-bedroom units. These will serve as dwellings for at least five years.\n\nThe strong community sentiment was that they wanted to stay in West Maui, and they wanted to raise their kids in West Maui. It's all towards the end of helping them repopulate back in Lahaina. While you're going through the steps of rebuilding, at least you have someplace to live. But the idea here is to get them back to full normalcy.\n\n_____\n\nA: Our mission is to advance -- culturally, politically, economically -- Native Hawaiians. And we are doing that, because Native Hawaiians are leading this recovery.\n\nIt hasn't taken us away from our mission, because at the end of the day, we're for a thriving Hawaii. In this moment, I see our organization as Hawaiians helping to uplift Hawaii. This is our homeland. If we're native to this place, we have a responsibility to take care of the people that live here, regardless of their ethnic background.\n\nSometimes we get too caught up in how to serve ourselves in our ethnic groups. That's not who we are as a people, as a culture. It's always been inclusive. And so this has returned us to that. We help everybody. It's the spirit of aloha.\n\n_____\n\nA: One of the key things that I'm most concerned about is Hawaii's fabric.\n\nWhat makes Hawaii unique, compared to anywhere around the world, is the culture. And when you start to see mass exodus of the people, you start to change the fabric of Hawaii. That's what's at stake is the future of who Hawaii is as a people, as a place.\n\nWe've lost thousands already to this fire. They've moved off island, to other states. Even before the fire, we were seeing a mass exodus of families leaving for stability outside of Hawaii because the cost of living was just too high.\n\nWe need to address the housing situation on Maui. And in the end, what happened here has actually fast-tracked that conversation. Now you're starting to see the policies to shift that trajectory.\n\nA: It meant a lot to hand keys over to this young family that lost everything. I went up (to the 50-unit development being built in Kahului) the other day to check on the progress of the homes, and the kids were playing in the yard. They made their own little makeshift pool using a tarp, and they were just playing water.\n\nWe've been able to give keys to a number of families at this point, and we'll continue to give those keys.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

HSTA leadership coordinated efforts, and those with permits to enter the burn zone picked up supplies from us to deliver to Lahaina,\" she recalled.\n\nMike Landes, president of HSTA's Maui Chapter and a social studies teacher at Lahainaluna High School, reflected on how educators supported each other and the community.\n\n\"In the first days after the fire, HSTA was like \u02bbohana,\" Landes said.\n\n\"We joke about it now. We've hugged more over the past year and especially in that first week or so, than ever in our lives,\" he added.\n\nLandes, the elected president of roughly 1,400 public and charter school teachers on Maui, said countless colleagues told him, \"The first people that I got contacted from checking to see if I was OK were my fellow teachers, my fellow members, my coworkers, my friends, my fellow HSTA members.\n\n\"The first help that I got was from our union, was from HSTA,\" Landes shared, quoting his fellow educators.\n\nLisa Thompson, the student activities coordinator at Maui's K\u016blanih\u0101ko\u02bbi High School and HSTA secretary-treasurer at the time of the fires, recalled, \"I happen to live very near to the (Kahului) airport. So when our HSTA staff from O\u02bbahu organized and got over as soon as they could, my dining room table was a tactical station for a couple of days, because we were trying to go through where our members were, creating maps, an overlay with what the fire impact area was so that we could reach out to them, trying to help them out because as they couldn't get through one side of the mountain, they could come around the other side, and making sure that we met up with them in order to give supplies.\"\n\nAshley Olson, a teacher at Lahainaluna High who works with multilingual students, said the union worked swiftly to provide financial, legal, and emotional support.\n\n\"In the immediate aftermath, our (HSTA) executive director and deputy executive director came (to Maui) and they brought with them attorneys who were doing pro bono work to just help people sift through their new reality. And it's meant a lot. And I feel that whatever I've ever given to HSTA, and my colleagues in time or dues, my community has gotten back a thousandfold,\" said Olson, who is a member of HSTA's Board of Directors.\n\nMore than 100 public school teachers and retirees lost their homes in the fires while educators lost their classrooms at King Kamehameha III Elementary School to the flames in Lahaina.\n\nThe National Education Association, HSTA's national affiliate union, \"pledged significant funds to support teachers who lost their homes or classrooms. HSTA promoted GoFundMe pages and other financial aids,\" Olson said.\n\nNEA President Becky Pringle told the HSTA Board of Directors in November, \"Know that we will be there with you throughout as you rebuild, as you heal, as you grieve, as you inspire each other.\"\n\nHSTA President Osa Tui, Jr. said, \"Our heartfelt thanks to more than 300 people and organizations from around the nation and across the state who have donated more than $434,000 for HSTA's fire relief efforts, especially the NEA and NEA Member Benefits.\"\n\nIn its first round of relief, the HSTA provided $1,000 checks to members who were displaced from their homes because their primary residence was damaged by the fires and $500 checks to members whose classrooms or workspaces were destroyed in the disaster. In late fall, the HSTA sent a second and final round of $2,665 relief checks to 92 members and HSTA-retired members whose homes remained unlivable or were destroyed.\n\nSeveral Maui educators also spoke with President Joe Biden and the first lady, Dr. Jill Biden, a fellow educator and NEA member herself, when the couple visited Maui last August. Dr. Jill Biden subsequently met with HSTA educators over Zoom to get recovery updates and share her support.\n\nDespite these efforts, Olson acknowledges that challenges persist, particularly concerning housing and mental health.\n\n\"Many teachers are still struggling with housing issues and the ongoing emotional impact of the fires,\" she added.\n\nEvelyn Ibonia, a fifth grade teacher at Kihei Elementary School, described the immediate aftermath of the fires as a period of intense adjustment.\n\n\"We had students from Lahaina displaced and brought into our schools. Our priority was to support these students and the teachers who were relocated,\" Ibonia said.\n\nIbonia noted that HSTA was instrumental in providing resources and emotional support during this challenging time. \"It has made us feel like more of a family,\" she said. \"That is why I feel so good to be part of this union.\"\n\nThompson, the student activities coordinator at K\u016blanih\u0101ko\u02bbi High and a longtime HSTA governance leader, noted the broader implications of the fires on education.\n\n\"The influx of students from Lahaina has put a strain on schools that were already facing challenges,\" Thompson said.\n\nThompson also pointed to continued difficulties in finding affordable housing and the exacerbation of pre-existing teacher shortages.\n\n\"We already had a housing shortage that affected teachers before the fires. Now it is even more difficult, so people who would love to stay cannot,\" she said.\n\n\"There was a very valuable teacher at the elementary on the west side, who had to move to O\u02bbahu in order to find housing, because they lived in an area where the landlord could get so much more money that they were kicked out. That's a teacher who wanted to stay, who was willing to stay, despite all the challenges, but could not get housing,\" Thompson added.\n\nWith the one-year mark of the fires this week, teachers and their communities continue to navigate the wildfires' aftermath.\n\n\"People are still dealing with the trauma, and it's crucial that we continue to support one another,\" Thompson said.\n\nOverall, HSTA leaders said the resilience demonstrated by teachers and the support provided by HSTA have been pivotal in helping the community recover.\n\n\"We've seen how powerful our union can be,\" said Landes, the president of HSTA's Maui Chapter.\n\nLandes recalled that in the immediate aftermath of the fires, people who lost their homes had a long list of things to do, such as \"checking their properties, clearing their land, meeting with FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), insurance companies, everything, and it has exhausted the leave that many people have banked up over the years.\"\n\nClassroom teachers in the islands receive just six personal leave days that they can take during the school year before they have to start taking leave without pay or sick leave.\n\nIn the weeks after the fires, the HSTA asked the Hawai\u02bbi State Department of Education to allow educators statewide to donate some of their leave and create a leave bank similar to what educators do now if someone has a terminal illness.\n\n\"The Department of Education's response was 'no.' In fact, I believe it was, 'We are not willing to consider that,'\" Landes said.\n\n\"As a result, a group of our members said we're going to go to the Board of Education and say we need to do this. And we pressured the Board of Education, and the Board of Education members overwhelmingly supported us. And thanks to those efforts, we got a memo from the superintendent saying they now will create the leave bank,\" Landes said.\n\nHIDOE employees must complete leave share paperwork to receive or donate Maui fires leave by Sept. 13.\n\nThompson concluded, \"It's definitely been a year of resilience, and we have seen that people have soldiered on and gone back to the classroom, and really tried to be there for students, as well as other colleagues while they're suffering.\n\n\"But it's been a year where I think that from the outside, we're expected to be all better a little bit too soon,\" Thompson said.", "source": {"uri": "mauinow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maui Now | Hawaii News  |  Local Maui News and Information | Hawaii News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maui"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Education_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Education Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahaina, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landes_(department)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landes (department)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahainaluna_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lahainaluna High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maui High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Costco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charter school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oahu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oahu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahului,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kahului, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kahului, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_S._Pringle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca S.

The Surrey Police Service (SPS) will become the city's official police service on Nov. 29.\n\n\"Surrey council has accepted the provincial funding for the police transition,\" Surrey Mayor Brenda Locke said in a news release. \"As we go through this process, council will be constantly working in the best interests of Surrey taxpayers.\"\n\nLocke was not present at the news conference announcing the deal.\n\nAmy Jugpal, communications and media relations lead for the City of Surrey's mayor's office, said Locke would not be immediately available for comment.\n\nThe provincial funding is divided into two parts. Each year until 2029, B.C. will give Surrey $30 million to assist with the cost of transitioning from the Surrey RCMP to the new police service.\n\nBetween 2029 and 2034, the province will also offer up to $20 million per year to pay the difference in salary between SPS officers and RCMP officers if Surrey police officers have a higher salary.\n\nSurrey residents will not be charged a police tax, and the agreement requires the city to provide space, funding and payroll for the new police service.\n\nThe transition has been fraught with controversy since former mayor Doug McCallum announced his plan to build a new Surrey Police Service about eight years ago.\n\nSince 2021, Surrey police officers have been deployed to the RCMP detachment. In 2022, under Locke's leadership, the City of Surrey announced it wanted to reverse course and transition back to the RCMP.\n\nIn May, the conflict went to the Supreme Court, which decided that B.C. has the right to order Surrey to transition to its own policing service.\n\nCurrently, the new police service has 431 sworn officers and support staff, according to the Public Safety Ministry. By the end of 2024, the Surrey police board has budgeted to hire 526 police officers.\n\nThe RCMP has agreed to continue supporting the Surrey Police Service with integrated policing units, such as its Integrated Homicide Investigation Team.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Locke", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brenda Locke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_municipalities_in_Canada_by_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Farnworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Farnworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_Serbia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Party of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ontario", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Ontario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_McCallum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug McCallum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7034432.1700522227!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/surrey-police-20230719.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722755", "eventUri": "eng-9722755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-29", "textStart": 598, "textEnd": 605}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 458348750, "relevance": 2}

The disturbance is not yet a tropical storm, but could develop into one in the next 48 hours, which would make it Tropical Storm Alberto and mark the start of the 2024 hurricane season. Parts of the Texas and Mexico coasts are under a tropical storm watch as the NHC expects a storm surge to bring one to four feet worth of rising ocean waters to dry areas in Galveston Bay, Sargent, Sabine Pass and the mouth of the Rio Grande. Louisiana will be under a risk of increased rainfall on Tuesday, CNN reported, which noted soil and area rivers in the western part of the state are still holding on to a significant amount of water after a wet spring. The storm system is not expected to make landfall in the U.S. according to its current track, but the NHC says flooding and rain could extend well beyond its center.

The federal agency forecasts between 17 and 25 named storms\u2014including tropical storms and hurricanes\u2014for 2024, citing abnormally warm sea surface temperatures and La Ni\u00f1a, a weather phenomenon that brings cooler temperatures to the Pacific and limits winds that could cancel out the formation of hurricanes.

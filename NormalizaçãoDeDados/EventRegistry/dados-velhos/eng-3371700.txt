The government is not even providing help to the victims,\" Yadav said.\n\nThe death toll in the BRD hospital since 7 August till Thursday was 71 due to various causes including encephalitis. Some of the deaths were alleged to have been caused by shortage of oxygen supply, a claim dismissed by the Uttar Pradesh government.\n\nDescribing Adityanath as \"the digital chief minister of a new India\", the former chief minister said he (Adityanath) was unaware of the reality and was instead embroiled in issues like namaz on the roads and Janmashtami functions in police stations. \"The BJP has given a digital chief minister to Uttar Pradesh ... Just as things digital are not on the ground, he too is oblivious of the real things,\" Yadav said, referring to Adityanath's statement that he has no right to stop Janmashtami celebrations in the police stations as he cannot stop offering of Eid prayers on the roads. \"The chief minister says the SP did not allow Janmashtami functions in the thanas...I ask as to when in the past 100 years the festival was not celebrated in the thanas... On the roads issue, ours is a great nation where people organise feasts also on the roads... \"The new India will not be created by talking about Eid prayers and Janmashtami in the thanas,\" he stressed.\n\nThe former chief minister said that if elected, his party's government will give Rs 5 lakh to each of the thanas for celebrating Holi, Diwali, Janmashtami, Eid and all other festivals. On the floods in several parts of the state, he alleged that the government was not extending enough help to the victims.\n\nHe also spoke on his detention while moving toward Auraiya on Thursday, saying that the BJP which had won 325 of the 403 Assembly seats in the elections earlier this year was not comfortable in facing the people for the panchayat chairman's post and, therefore, was harassing the MLAs with the help of the police.\n\nHe said that his party, if required, will launch an agitation over the issue.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 18, 2017 06:25 pm | Updated Date: Aug 18, 2017 06:25 pm\n\nTags :#Akhilesh yadav#Brd medical college#Cbi#Deaths#Gorakhpur#Hospital#India#Lucknow#Newstracker#Oxygen#Samajwadi party", "id": "9898996", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Gorakhpur hospital tragedy: Akhilesh Yadav wants CBI probe, says his party will launch agitation if required", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AkhileshYadav1_AFP1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 895, "date": "2017-08-07", "amb": false, "textEnd": 903}, {"textStart": 2781, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2793}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "53310", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Gorakhpur"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "54342", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorakhpur", "label": {"eng": "Gorakhpur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}, "id": "305750", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lakh"}, "id": "306100", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}, "id": "309647", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eid prayers"}, "id": "314542", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_prayers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Salah"}, "id": "317101", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diwali"}, "id": "328626", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali"}, {"label": {"eng": "Krishna Janmashtami"}, "id": "328631", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Janmashtami"}, {"label": {"eng": "Holika Dahan"}, "id": "339027", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eid al-Fitr"}, "id": "342608", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "366737", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "Government of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Panchayati raj"}, "id": "367576", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchayati_raj"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}, "id": "376166", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yogi Adityanath"}, "id": "574878", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adityanath_Yogi"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 369, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building Types", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building_Types"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 370, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas"}], "time": "13:06:00"}

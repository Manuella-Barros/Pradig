The body was found under the rubble of a three-story apartment building constructed in 1988 in the Kucukcekmece district of the city. After the building collapsed, one person emerged from the rubble on his own, informing the rescue teams about those trapped inside. Istanbul Governor Davut Gul said two injured people are in serious condition. One of the two seriously injured people in the hospital is identified as a 6-month-old girl. The district municipality teams evacuated three buildings surrounding the collapsed one as a precaution. While the cause was not immediately known, the judicial and administrative processes related to the incident are underway. \u201cDuring the first on-site inspections, sea sand was used in its construction, and interventions were made to disrupt the statics of the building in later stages,\u201d said Mehmet Ozhaseki, the minister of environment, urbanisation and climate change, on X. The owner of the building, H.M.G., was arrested after the incident.

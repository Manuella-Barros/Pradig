Trafigura and its employees have denied knowing about any such fraud.\n\n\"In light of the Gupta fraud, Hyphen's reasonable suspicion is that the goods... were not in fact nickel... but were in fact worthless rubble,\" Hyphen said in a previous court document.\n\nTrafigura has said in previous court documents that it sold a small number of the Gupta cargoes to third parties, including to U.S. company Argentem Trade Services.\n\nHyphen said that in July 2022 it agreed to buy nickel from Argentem, which was due to be shipped by Trafigura from Taiwan to Rotterdam.\n\nHyphen said on LinkedIn that it is part of the Reuben Brothers Group, and UK Companies House records show Hyphen Trading as a wholly-owned subsidiary of RB International UK.\n\n(Reporting by Eric Onstad; additional reporting by Julian Luk; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyphen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafigura", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trafigura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nickel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ship breaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Companies House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/214e59d/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F25%2Fcfdc18d21a5c4e2d446c592dc15a3e%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK540JH%3A12024-06-05T122736Z_1_LYNXMPEK540JH_RTROPTP_3_TRAFIGURA-EXECUTIVE.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626848", "eventUri": "eng-9626848", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 774, "textEnd": 780}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

That's not unusual for the commodity trading giant, which sells hundreds of billions of dollars worth of oil, gas and metals every year.\n\nBut this time a much larger proportion of them were late paying. Trafigura said that 15.8% of its receivables were more than 60 days overdue, nearly three times the level at the end of September. That implies that Trafigura had $1.66 billion of receivables more than 60 days overdue, up from $594 million six months earlier.\n\nEven more unusual: Trafigura took a significant loss in relation to those receivables. It recognised expected credit losses of $330.2 million, up one hundred-fold from just $3.3 million at the end of September.\n\nIn more than a decade of Trafigura accounts that are public, the company's expected credit loss on its receivables has never been higher than $6 million. In its 2015 annual report the company even boasted that a historical analysis from 2000 to 2015 showed that Trafigura \"has demonstrated that there is no significant expected credit risk arising from its trade receivable portfolio and therefore no expected credit loss.\"\n\nStephan Jansma, Trafigura's incoming chief financial officer, explained the situation earlier on a company video accompanying the results: \"If you look at commodity prices where they are today they're not the lowest, so that means that importing countries from time to time will have issues in their payment profile, as well as higher interest rates of course has an effect on some of our customers as well,\" he said. \"And hence it's logical that we have more overdues.\"\n\nOne part of the explanation may lie in Mongolia. Bloomberg reported in February that Trafigura was facing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses related to its oil activities in Mongolia, and the company said at the time that it had recently agreed repayment schedules with oil products customers in the country.\n\nThe size of the potential losses is large relative to Mongolia's tiny oil market. Mongolia's annual oil consumption amounted to just 35,000 barrels a day in 2022, according to the US Energy Information Administration, worth about $1 billion a year at current prices.\n\nOn Thursday, a Trafigura spokesperson said the overdue receivables were \"spread geographically and over a relatively large number of counterparts.\"\n\n\"We work with a large number of customers in emerging markets, facing higher commodity prices combined with high interest rates, and we have a good track record of recovering outstanding balances .\"\n\nWith assistance from Archie Hunter.\n\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Trafigura said that 15.8% of its receivables were more than 60 days overdue, nearly three times the level at the end of September. That implies that Trafigura had $1.66 billion of receivables more than 60 days overdue, up from $594 million six months earlier.\n\nEven more unusual: Trafigura took a significant loss in relation to those receivables. It recognised expected credit losses of $330.2 million, up one hundred-fold from just $3.3 million at the end of September.\n\nIn more than a decade of Trafigura accounts that are public, the company's expected credit loss on its receivables has never been higher than $6 million. In its 2015 annual report the company even boasted that a historical analysis from 2000 to 2015 showed that Trafigura \"has demonstrated that there is no significant expected credit risk arising from its trade receivable portfolio and therefore no expected credit loss.\"\n\nStephan Jansma, Trafigura's incoming chief financial officer, explained the situation earlier on a company video accompanying the results: \"If you look at commodity prices where they are today they're not the lowest, so that means that importing countries from time to time will have issues in their payment profile, as well as higher interest rates of course has an effect on some of our customers as well,\" he said. \"And hence it's logical that we have more overdues.\"\n\nOne part of the explanation may lie in Mongolia. Bloomberg reported in February that Trafigura was facing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses related to its oil activities in Mongolia, and the company said at the time that it had recently agreed repayment schedules with oil products customers in the country.\n\nThe size of the potential losses is large relative to Mongolia's tiny oil market. Mongolia's annual oil consumption amounted to just 35,000 barrels a day in 2022, according to the US Energy Information Administration, worth about $1 billion a year at current prices.\n\nOn Thursday, a Trafigura spokesperson said the overdue receivables were \"spread geographically and over a relatively large number of counterparts.\"\n\n\"We work with a large number of customers in emerging markets, facing higher commodity prices combined with high interest rates, and we have a good track record of recovering outstanding balances (both trade receivables and prepayments).\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafigura", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trafigura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commodity market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mongolia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mongolia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emerging market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Credit_and_Collection", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Credit and Collection", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2082110!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626848", "eventUri": "eng-9626848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Its financial year ends in September.\n\nThe drop follows a period of record earnings for the world's biggest traders, who all profited from the disruption in commodity markets triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nFounded by its former French chief executive Claude Dauphin in 1993, Trafigura has evolved from a scrappy, secretive trader into one of the world's most important commodity companies, with business in 150 countries and assets ranging from mines and ports to energy infrastructure.\n\nChief financial officer Christophe Salmon said \"more normalised market conditions\" had returned but stressed that it still ranked as Trafigura's fourth-highest first-half profit.\n\n\"In the frame of our 31-year history, we can qualify this semester as very strong,\" he said.\n\nAlthough turnover fell to $124.2bn from $131.3bn in the first half of 2023, due to lower commodity prices, Trafigura traded 15 per cent more oil and gas year-on-year, mainly by suppling more crude to European refineries, it said.\n\nRecord profits have helped more than double Trafigura's total group equity since 2019 and it rose again in the past six months to $17.3bn at the end of March from $16.5bn in September.\n\nSalmon, who has served as finance chief for almost 10 years, will retire in June and be replaced by the company's CFO for Asia, Stephan Jansma.\n\nThe prolonged period of elevated commodity prices has led to payment problems with some customers. The proportion of invoices more than 60 days overdue has risen from 5 per cent at end of September to almost 16 per cent at the end of March.\n\n\"If you look at commodity prices where they are today, they are not the lowest so that means that importing countries from time to time will have issues in their payment profile\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and hence it is logical that we have more overdue,\" Jansma said.\n\nSalmon's exit coincides with a wider changing of the guard at the top of the trading house. Trafigura reshuffled its senior team last year and executive director Jose Maria Larocca, who has helped run the business since 2007, is also leaving in September.\n\nChief executive Jeremy Weir has no immediate plans to retire but in April told the Financial Times that his successor would need to have a broad set of skills and would not be picked based on which trader was making the most money for the business.\n\nTrafigura also confirmed it had settled a case with billionaire property magnates the Reuben brothers, which was linked to an alleged $600mn nickel fraud that rocked the commodity trader last year.\n\nThe British pair had made claims for $8.4mn.

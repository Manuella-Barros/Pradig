Addressing journalists in Ado-Ekiti ahead of the Festival billed for August 6-10,2024 , the Commissioner disclosed that the hosting of this year\u2019s event was at the instance of the State governor, Biodun Oyebanji. The Professor of Dramatic and Performing Arts revealed that his ministry had to prove its mettle in uplifting the culture of the state since its establishment and adjudged amongst the best performing ministries by the Ekiti State House of Assembly at its first anniversary. He said the governor mandated his ministry to ensure a superlative outing that will place Ekiti on an enviable cultural heights. The Commissioner who acknowledged the role of the media in projecting and promoting the activities of the ministry,also solicited the sustenance of the relationship,. He stressed that the media Professionals are partners in progress in ensuring a robust and successful. Prof. Bakare hinted that EKIFEST began with a view to creating a platform for local governments to bring whatever they have from their environments to the centre for exposure, exhibitions, marketing, developments and all that the world can help them with these products. Prof. Bakare stressed that the festival is a forum for people to exhibit products of their culture, products of their talents, products of their creative energies. \u201cYou have thousands of talented youths in those villages and towns across the state that can sing better songs than some musicians. You have visual artists, painters, sculptors, weavers, graphic designers. You have them. They abound in those towns and villages. But they don\u2019t have the opportunity of recognition. Nobody recognizes them because nobody knows what they\u2019re doing. \u201cIt is for people like that that EKIFEST was established as a platform so that the local government authorities and the Local Council Development Areas, LCDAs can fish for such talents and bring them to this five day festival to showcase their talents, to exhibit their talents so that they can get recognition across the globe\u201d. \u201cPeople who are coming to Ekiti state with different products, such people, he remarked, are not just coming as tourists to stay here and spend their money. What we also want them to do is to see what our people are capable of producing with their talents so that they can invest in these products, so that they can help us take these products beyond the borders of Ekiti state and beyond the borders of Nigeria. That\u2019s why we are organizing EKIFEST\u201d. \u201d But that all the events, either competitive or not, are exhibitional for people to see what the people that have the capacity and the creativity are doing. Some of the competitive events are performing art, the visual arts, the fashion art, traditional sports, that\u2019s, traditional wrestling and others. The non-competitive events will include opening and closing ceremony, where each chairman of a Local government or LCDA will take his/her contingent on a procession at the venue. There also a festival hall where the people are bringing locally-made materials to sell for those number of days.\u201d The Commissioner said . He underscored that the future of festival of this nature is actually in the hands of the private sector. Ekiti State Festival of Arts and Culture began in 2012, and held every year, but in 2020 it was held in the closet because of COVID-19. And it could not hold in 2023 because of transition from outing administration to incoming government.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"220\" height=\"145\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0022.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" /></div>The State Commissioner for Culture, Arts and Creative Economy, Prof. Rasak Ojo Bakare has said that the year&#8217;s edition of the&#160; Ekiti Cultural Festival (EKIFEST) would be a platform to showcase Ekiti culture, products of their talents and&#160; creative energies.

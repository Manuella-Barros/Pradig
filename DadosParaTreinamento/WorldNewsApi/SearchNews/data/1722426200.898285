Heavenly Desserts will fill part of the old Pizza Express unit, which closed in 2020 when the chain axed 73 restaurants, including five in the West Midlands. Pictures released ahead of its July 6 opening showed plush interiors and a bright marble-look dining area for sweet-toothed customers. The restaurant is owned by Haroon Liaquat and his brothers and will be their second Heavenly Desserts franchise in Birmingham, following their launch on Soho Road. The menu will include the brand\u2019s signature cheesecakes, cookie doughs and croffles, and there will be options for vegan, halal and gluten-free diners. News of the opening was met with hundreds of comments on Solihull Updates Facebook group, with dessert enthusiasts hailing the shop as \"amazing\" and one the \"kids will love.\" READ MORE: Diner asks 'can I give it 10 stars?' after new Italian restaurant moves into Solihull For more stories from across Solihull including BHX, breaking news, politics and what's on, sign up to our MySolihull newsletter Heavenly Desserts will include velvet seating booths as well as takeaway options. Haroon said the idea was to stop Solihull residents having to travel to Birmingham for dessert, and he believed it had \"huge potential.\" He said: \u201cHeavenly Desserts has always had a special place in my heart as it\u2019s the place my wife and I would meet before we got married, so when the opportunity to franchise with the business came around, it felt like the perfect opportunity for us. After seeing huge success at Handsworth, it felt like the right time to branch out to another area that has demand. \u201cMy family and I live near Shirley, and we\u2019ve seen a huge increase in new restaurants popping up, as well as a younger demographic moving in. Despite this, there are still not many local options for a good dessert without having to venture further into Birmingham, so Shirley has huge potential. \u201cNot only is the location ideal for footfall, but we\u2019re also committed to supporting the local area, which is why we\u2019ve recruited 20 staff locally, offering younger people a chance to learn about the hospitality industry. \u201cThere\u2019s no other dessert restaurant quite as innovative and ahead of the curve as Heavenly Desserts, and I\u2019m excited for the people of Shirley to experience the great menu and customer service that the brand is known for.\u201d Last month we told how Lasan Group-owned Fatto a Napoli Cafeteria and Pizzeria had moved into the old Prezzo unit, also at Parkgate. The new Italian restaurant was flooded with four and five star reviews within days of opening. Read what diners had to say in our story, here. Heavenly Desserts Shirley will be open from 10am to 11pm daily, Monday to Sunday. The restaurant is located at Parkgate Shopping Centre, Stratford Road, Shirley, B90 3GG.

Anders, William *17.10.1933-Astronaut USAPortrait im Raumanzug mit Helm- 1968 (Photo by ullstein bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images) ullstein bild via Getty Images I write a regular column for The Explorers Journal, the quarterly publication of The Explorers Club, called \u201cWhat Were Thinking?\u201dIt\u2019s a clever title, but it\u2019s about exactly what you might expect: What explorers were thinking at the time they did the thing they were most known for. I get some interesting answers to my interview questions, not necessarily what one might expect. The great Sir Edmund Hillary, in 1953 first to climb the mess that has lately become Mt. Everest, for example, told me, \u201cI looked around for any remnants of [George] Mallory, in case he had made the top [in 1924], and, of course, found none. But I also remember looking out at the great peak Makalu, working out a route about how it might be climbed, then thinking that it wasn\u2019t over for me by any means. I was already thinking about my next adventure.\u201d Then there was there was Apollo 11\u2019s Buzz Aldrin, second man to walk on the moon, in 1969: \u201cCan you give me a multiple-choice list of answers about how I should have felt? As far as I was concerned, we were proceeding with the checklist.\u201d But maybe the most unexpected answer was that of Bill Anders, who yesterday at 90 sadly passed away. On Christmas Eve of 1968, he was part of the crew of Apollo 8. Earthrise - Apollo 8, December 24, 1968. This view of the rising Earth greeted the Apollo 8 ... [+] astronauts as they came from behind the Moon after the fourth nearside orbit. The photo, by astronaut William Anders, is displayed here in its original orientation, though it is more commonly viewed with the lunar surface at the bottom of the photo. Earth is about five degrees left of the horizon in the photo. The unnamed surface features on the left are near the eastern limb of the Moon as viewed from Earth. The lunar horizon is approximately 780 kilometers from the spacecraft. Height of the photographed area at the lunar horizon is about 175 kilometers. Artist William A Anders.

As part of their flight, the team captured awe-inspiring photos, some looking back at Earth.

His photo was selected by NASA to represent the mission, and later became perhaps the most iconic of the Twentieth Century. When I asked him what he was thinking at the time he snapped it, he said, surprisingly, that he felt a little guilty. \u201cWe were saving film,\u201d he said. \u201cOur objective was not to take pictures of the Earth. There were lots of lunar craters I was supposed to shoot, and approaches to future landing sites, but here I was, off mission, taking unauthorized pictures! \u201cLater, I'm getting Emmys and being made a member of the photographer's union, all the while thinking this is a little phony. \"Earthrise\" isn't that good of a picture if you really look at it. It\u2019s not quite in focus. Photographers are probably jealous it was picked as one of the top pictures of the Twentieth Century, but right place, right time!\u201d My full Forbes interview with Anders, which was quoted in his New York Times obituary, is available at the link below. But suffice it to say that our great heroes are quickly thinning in numbers. Look at the few courageous D-Day soldiers left who participateed in this week\u2019s D-Day ceremony in Normandy, France.

(Photo by J.B. Spector/Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago/Getty Images) Getty Images Only four of the 12 men who walked on the moon are still with us: Aldrin, now 94; Dave Scott, 92 (Apollo 15); Charlie Duke, 88 (Apollo 16); and Harrison Schmitt, 88 (Apollo 17). Let\u2019s celebrate these guys while we still have them. They are the real deals, people who rdid something meaningful to contribute to science and mankind\u2019s collective knowledge, unlike today\u2019s adventure tourists who use social media to claim they are more than they really are.

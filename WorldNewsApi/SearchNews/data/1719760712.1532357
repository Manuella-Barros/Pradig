The length of time for a cooling off period can vary depending on what the intended use of the vehicle is, but it can be days or weeks. Although it doesn\u2019t work for all car owners, the cooling off period makes it possible for some to track down their vehicles and get them back. That was the case for a woman living in Ottawa who put a tracking device in her Jeep in December 2022. She alerted police and they recovered the vehicle together only a few kilometres away from her home, CBC News reported. What can vehicle owners do? The Toronto Police Service offers advice on how to prevent vehicle theft by taking several precautions. When parking at home, they recommend installing a motion sensor light and always setting the emergency break. They also said drivers should never leave anything on display in a vehicle, including \u201cpurses left in the front seat when pumping gas and power chords to run and charge devices as these may attract thieves to your vehicle.\u201d A car alarm can be installed as a deterrent, although it\u2019s not a guarantee of keeping thieves away, they said.

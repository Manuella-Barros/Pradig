announcement was made through a press release issued by the Office of the President, highlighting Tebogo's remarkable achievement at the global stage.\n\nPresident Masisi noted that Tebogo's victory is a milestone not only for Botswana but for the entire African continent, making it a moment worthy of national celebration.\n\n\"The decision has been duly made to recognise and honour Letsile Tebogo as the first Motswana and first African to win a Gold Medal for 200m in the history of the Olympics.\n\n\"Furthermore, the president underscores, recognises, and acknowledges Letsile's performance and achievement as markedly outstanding, and deserving of the nation to pause and celebrate him in a most unique, appropriate and responsible manner, that will be etched in the annals of the history of the Republic,\" read the statement.\n\nIn his address to the nation, President Masisi expressed his immense pride and gratitude on behalf of all the citizens of Botswana.\n\nHe applauded Tebogo for his dedication and perseverance, while also giving thanks to Tebogo's late mother, acknowledging her role in shaping the athlete's journey.\n\nTebogo delivered a remarkable performance finishing with a time of 19.46 seconds, which is not only an African record but also positions him fifth on the all-time world list for the event.\n\nIn a thrilling final, Tebogo outpaced his competitors, including the reigning 100m Olympic champion Noah Lyles and silver medalist Kenny Bednarek from the USA.\n\nBednarek secured the silver with a time of 19.62 seconds, while Lyles took bronze in 19.70 seconds, the fastest time ever recorded for a third-place finisher in the 200m final.\n\nThis race saw Lyles, who had a winning streak dating back to the Tokyo Olympics, experience his first loss in 26 races, having been defeated by Tebogo in the semifinals as well.\n\nTebogo's victory was particularly emotional as he dedicated his win to his late mother, Seratiwa, who passed away

Letsile Tebogo is from Botswana in southern Africa, a continent with a rich history of producing world-class runners.\n\nParis, Aug 9 (AP) Letsile Tebogo is from Botswana in southern Africa, a continent with a rich history of producing world-class runners.\n\nJust not like the kind Tebogo does for a living. He's hoping 20 seconds of greatness -- check 19.46 seconds of greatness -- might change that.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan Ahead of India on Paris Olympics 2024 Medals Tally Despite Having Won Just One Medal, Here Is Why.\n\nThe 21-year-old pulled off a stunner (sort of) in the men's 200 meters at the Paris Olympics on Thursday night, producing the first-ever Olympic gold by an African runner in the distance.\n\nAmerican Kenneth Bednarek got out to an early lead, but Tebosgo said he was confident he had more than enough to track him down.\n\nAlso Read | Neeraj Chopra's Mother Calls Arshad Nadeem 'Hamara Ladka' While Praising Her Son For Silver Medal Win in Men's Javelin Throw At Paris Olympics 2024 (Watch Video).\n\nBy the middle of the stretch, Tebogo was in front and waited for a challenge from American star Noah Lyles that never came -- perhaps in part because Lyles is dealing with COVID-19 -- to win going away.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So, that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nOne who is also a three-time world champion. Lost amid the chaos of Lyles collapsing briefly on the track in the aftermath and his revelation that he tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday was this: Tebogo's time was the fastest by anyone in the world this year. Lyles included.\n\nHeady territory for an athlete who gets himself amped up before a race by playing traditional songs he learned growing up in Kanye, Botswana, not far from the landlocked nation's border with South Africa.\n\nThe ritual allows Tebogo to relax, drawing a stark contrast between him and the relentlessly amped Lyles.\n\nWhile Lyles roared onto the purple track at Stade de France preening, Tebogo was one lane to Lyles' right mentally preparing for the race of his life.\n\nAnd when Tebogo ran it, he draped the blue, white and black flag of his country over his shoulders, hung his orange cleats around his neck presented his right shoe to a nearby camera to reveal a tribute to his mother, Elizabeth Seratiwa, who died in May.\n\n\"She always dreamed of making it to here,\" Tebogo said.\n\nSo did his younger sister, who was somewhere in the sea of seats that roared during the race, a roar that grew louder when it became obvious Lyles wasn't going to track Tebogo down the way he had to just about everyone since Tokyo in his signature event.\n\nNot this time. While there may not be an official rivalry between Tebogo and Lyles, the seeds may have been planted somewhere between Lyles' preening and Tebogo's decisive victory.\n\nAsked afterwards if he envisions himself becoming one of the standard bearers in sprinting, Tebogo threw a dash of shade in his answer.\n\n\"I can't be the face of athletics because I'm not an arrogant or a loud person like Noah (Lyles),\" he said.\n\nMaybe. Tebogo's biography in the official Olympics media program quotes him as saying he wants \"to be remembered as one of the best athletes who ever lived.\"\n\nHe's probably already there back home, a largely rural country of 2.63 million roughly the size of France that serves as a popular destination for tourists going on African safaris.\n\nThe pace of life in Kanye isn't typically hectic. Maybe that makes Tebogo's triumph of a young man in a hurry ironic in a way.\n\nTebogo fought off a balky hamstring to win bronze in the 200 behind Lyles and his US teammate Erriyon Knighton in the 2023 athletics world championship.\n\nHe finished ahead of Lyles in their 200 semifinal on Wednesday. Lyles' camp said he Lyles was fine afterwards, indicating he was saving himself for the final.\n\nPerhaps he was. Yet when Tebogo took off, Lyles saw only the bib on the back of Tebogo's race shirt. Lyles never saw the bib on the front.\n\nNot until the end anyway, when Tebogo unpinned it, grabbed each end and presented it for all the world to see. The people of Africa most of all.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody,\" he said. \"The country, the continent and my family at large.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news",

Tebogo dedicated his victory to his late mother, imbuing his performance with personal significance and emotional depth. At 21, Tebogo became the youngest men's 200m gold medalist since 1956, showcasing his elite talent and resilience.\n\nIn a surprise result, Botswana's Letsile Tebogo is the new men's 200m Olympic champion. Tebogo bested a field that included the pre-race favourite, American Noah Lyles, to win in a time of 19.46 seconds to claim his country's third-ever Olympic medal of any colour, and first ever gold.\n\nWith this gold medal, the young Botswanan Tebogo has elevated himself to the elite level of his sport. His time of 19.46 seconds sets an African record in the 200m. At 21, he becomes the youngest gold medalist in the men's 200m since American Bobby Joe Morrow in 1956.\n\nTough Year for Letsile Tebogo\n\nTebogo's victory comes hot off the heels of a difficult year away from the track. He lost his mother, Seratiwa, in May. As he prepared for the Olympics, he engraved his nails with her initials and dedicated his gold medal to her.\n\nTebogo, World Championship runner-up to Lyles last year, was keen to state the role that his mother played in his career. He ran in a special pair of running shoes, adorned with her date of birth, which he showed to the cameras after the final.\n\n\"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take,\" Tebego told reporters. \"Me, to take her, it gives me a lot of motivation.\n\n\"I didn't want to put the date of her death, because I'll get emotional. I took about a month without doing anything. It wasn't really clicking for me that she's really gone. For me, I have to find the reason why I started my athletics journey and why I should continue going on. (If she were here) I believe she could be one of the happiest people on the planet because she believed in me when I doubted myself. She's watching up there. And she's really, really happy.\"\n\nTebogo also revealed the words his coach said to him before the final.\n\n\"My coach has told me just now, 'now it's your race, you can do whatever you want. It's either a medal or not, I don't care - you made it through after all you have been through, making it to the final, I'm the happiest coach ever',\" Tebogo told Eurosport. \"So, for me, this is a really amazing moment for myself.\n\n\"Before the race, when I was walking to the call room, he just told me 'I think it's now best we just do what we did in London when we ran the African record',\" Tebogo added. \"When the gun went, I knew Kenny (Bednarek, who took the silver medal in second place) was going to run away so make sure, just close him down, because I have that top-end speed that will allow me to be in the race without getting tired.\n\n\"So that's what I did, and when I saw [Bednarek] fade, I knew Noah was far away behind us. So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It really means a lot to my late mum because she always dreamt of making it here. I think my little sister is in the stands. I don't know where she's sitting, but I believe she's happy, she's representing her while she's here. So it means a lot for everybody - the country, the continent, and my family at large.\"\n\nRelated Fan Footage Shows Noah Lyles' Actions Before 200m Final\n\nOlympic sprinter Noah Lyles was loving the fans' reception before the 200m final, but should he have been behaving in that way with COVID?", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mixcollage-09-aug-2024-09-01-am-2521.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803710", "eventUri": "eng-9803710", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

He's hoping 20 seconds of greatness - check 19.46 seconds of greatness - might change that.\n\nThe 21-year-old pulled off a stunner (sort of) in the men's 200 meters at the Paris Olympics on Thursday night, producing the first-ever Olympic gold by an African runner in the distance.\n\nAmerican Kenneth Bednarek got out to an early lead, but Tebosgo said he was confident that he had more than enough to track him down. By the middle of the stretch, Tebogo was in front and waited for a challenge from American star Noah Lyles that never came - perhaps in part because Lyles is dealing with COVID-19 - to win going away.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I\u00b4m the Olympic champion.\"\n\nOne who is also a three-time world champion.\n\nLetsile Tebogo, of Botswana, celebrates after winning the men's 200-meter final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Thursday, Aug. 8, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader)\n\nLost amid the chaos of Lyles collapsing briefly on the track in the aftermath and his revelation that he tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday was this: Tebogo's time was the fastest by anyone in the world this year.\n\nLyles included.\n\nHeady territory for an athlete who gets himself amped up before a race by playing traditional songs he learned growing up in Kanye, Botswana, not far from the landlocked nation's border with South Africa.\n\nThe ritual allows Tebogo to relax, drawing a stark contrast between him and the relentlessly amped Lyles. While Lyles roared onto the purple track at Stade de France preening, Tebogo was one lane to Lyles' right mentally preparing for the race of his life.\n\nAnd when Tebogo ran it, he draped the blue, white and black flag of his country over his shoulders, hung his orange cleats around his neck presented his right shoe to a nearby camera to reveal a tribute to his mother, Elizabeth Seratiwa, who died in May.\n\n\"She always dreamed of making it to here,\" Tebogo said.\n\nSo did his younger sister, who was somewhere in the sea of seats that roared during the race, a roar that grew louder when it became obvious Lyles wasn't going to track Tebogo down the way he had to just about everyone since Tokyo in his signature event.\n\nNot this time. While there may not be an official rivalry between Tebogo and Lyles, the seeds may have been planted somewhere between Lyles' preening and Tebogo's decisive victory.\n\nAsked afterward if he envisions himself as becoming one of the standard bearers in sprinting, Tebogo threw a dash of shade in his answer.\n\n\"I can\u00b4t be the face of athletics because I\u00b4m not an arrogant or a loud person like Noah (Lyles),\" he said.\n\nMaybe. Tebogo's biography in the official Olympics media program quotes him as saying he wants \"to be remembered as one of the best athletes who ever lived.\"\n\nHe's probably already there back home, a largely rural country of 2.63 million roughly the size of France that serves as a popular destination for tourists going on African safaris. The pace of life in Kanye isn't typically hectic. Maybe that makes Tebogo's triumph of a young man in a hurry ironic in a way.\n\nTebogo fought off a balky hamstring to win bronze in the 200 behind Lyles and his U.S. teammate Erriyon Knighton in the 2023 athletics world championship. He actually finished ahead of Lyles in their 200 semifinal on Wednesday. Lyles' camp said he Lyles was fine afterward, indicating he was simply saving himself for the final.\n\nPerhaps he was. Yet when Tebogo took off, Lyles saw only the bib on the back of Tebogo's race shirt. Lyles never saw the bib on the front.\n\nNot until the end anyway, when Tebogo unpinned it, grabbed each end and presented it for all world to see. The people of Africa most of all.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody,\" he said. \"The country, the continent and my family at large.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Dampf contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nLetsile Tebogo, of Botswana, celebrates after winning the men's 200-meter final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Thursday, Aug. 8, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

He's hoping 20 seconds of greatness -- check 19.46 seconds of greatness -- might change that.\n\nThe 21-year-old pulled off a stunner (sort of) in the men's 200 meters at the Paris Olympics on Thursday night, producing the first-ever Olympic gold by an African runner in the distance.\n\nAmerican Kenneth Bednarek got out to an early lead, but Tebosgo said he was confident that he had more than enough to track him down. By the middle of the stretch, Tebogo was in front and waited for a challenge from American star Noah Lyles that never came -- perhaps in part because Lyles is dealing with COVID-19 -- to win going away.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nOne who is also a three-time world champion.\n\nLost amid the chaos of Lyles collapsing briefly on the track in the aftermath and his revelation that he tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday was this: Tebogo's time was the fastest by anyone in the world this year.\n\nLyles included.\n\nHeady territory for an athlete who gets himself amped up before a race by playing traditional songs he learned growing up in Kanye, Botswana, not far from the landlocked nation's border with South Africa.\n\nThe ritual allows Tebogo to relax, drawing a stark contrast between him and the relentlessly amped Lyles. While Lyles roared onto the purple track at Stade de France preening, Tebogo was one lane to Lyles' right mentally preparing for the race of his life.\n\nAnd when Tebogo ran it, he draped the blue, white and black flag of his country over his shoulders, hung his orange cleats around his neck presented his right shoe to a nearby camera to reveal a tribute to his mother, Elizabeth Seratiwa, who died in May.\n\n\"She always dreamed of making it to here,\" Tebogo said.\n\nSo did his younger sister, who was somewhere in the sea of seats that roared during the race, a roar that grew louder when it became obvious Lyles wasn't going to track Tebogo down the way he had to just about everyone since Tokyo in his signature event.\n\nNot this time. While there may not be an official rivalry between Tebogo and Lyles, the seeds may have been planted somewhere between Lyles' preening and Tebogo's decisive victory.\n\nAsked afterward if he envisions himself as becoming one of the standard bearers in sprinting, Tebogo threw a dash of shade in his answer.\n\n\"I can't be the face of athletics because I'm not an arrogant or a loud person like Noah (Lyles),\" he said.\n\nMaybe. Tebogo's biography in the official Olympics media program quotes him as saying he wants \"to be remembered as one of the best athletes who ever lived.\"\n\nHe's probably already there back home, a largely rural country of 2.63 million roughly the size of France that serves as a popular destination for tourists going on African safaris. The pace of life in Kanye isn't typically hectic. Maybe that makes Tebogo's triumph of a young man in a hurry ironic in a way.\n\nTebogo fought off a balky hamstring to win bronze in the 200 behind Lyles and his U.S. teammate Erriyon Knighton in the 2023 athletics world championship. He actually finished ahead of Lyles in their 200 semifinal on Wednesday. Lyles' camp said he Lyles was fine afterward, indicating he was simply saving himself for the final.\n\nPerhaps he was. Yet when Tebogo took off, Lyles saw only the bib on the back of Tebogo's race shirt. Lyles never saw the bib on the front.\n\nNot until the end anyway, when Tebogo unpinned it, grabbed each end and presented it for all world to see. The people of Africa most of all.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody,\" he said. \"The country, the continent and my family at large.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Dampf contributed to this

Tebogo would say it was like he was carrying her with each stride he took and it gave him the motivation to win.\n\nTebogo said that she would have been very happy for him and his achievement.\n\n\"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take,\" Tebego told reporters. \"Me, to take her, it gives me a lot of motivation.\n\n\"I didn't want to put the date of her death, because I'll get emotional.\n\n\"I took about a month without doing anything. It wasn't really clicking for me that she's really gone.

He's hoping 20 seconds of greatness -- check 19.46 seconds of greatness -- might change that.\n\nThe 21-year-old pulled off a stunner (sort of) in the men's 200 meters at the Paris Olympics on Thursday night, producing the first-ever Olympic gold by an African runner in the distance.\n\nAmerican Kenneth Bednarek got out to an early lead, but Tebosgo said he was confident that he had more than enough to track him down. By the middle of the stretch, Tebogo was in front and waited for a challenge from American star Noah Lyles that never came -- perhaps in part because Lyles is dealing with COVID-19 -- to win going away.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nOne who is also a three-time world champion.\n\nLost amid the chaos of Lyles collapsing briefly on the track in the aftermath and his revelation that he tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday was this: Tebogo's time was the fastest by anyone in the world this year.\n\nLyles included.\n\nHeady territory for an athlete who gets himself amped up before a race by playing traditional songs he learned growing up in Kanye, Botswana, not far from the landlocked nation's border with South Africa.\n\nThe ritual allows Tebogo to relax, drawing a stark contrast between him and the relentlessly amped Lyles. While Lyles roared onto the purple track at Stade de France preening, Tebogo was one lane to Lyles' right mentally preparing for the race of his life.\n\nAnd when Tebogo ran it, he draped the blue, white and black flag of his country over his shoulders, hung his orange cleats around his neck presented his right shoe to a nearby camera to reveal a tribute to his mother, Elizabeth Seratiwa, who died in May.\n\n\"She always dreamed of making it to here,\" Tebogo said.\n\nSo did his younger sister, who was somewhere in the sea of seats that roared during the race, a roar that grew louder when it became obvious Lyles wasn't going to track Tebogo down the way he had to just about everyone since Tokyo in his signature event.\n\nNot this time. While there may not be an official rivalry between Tebogo and Lyles, the seeds may have been planted somewhere between Lyles' preening and Tebogo's decisive victory.\n\nAsked afterward if he envisions himself as becoming one of the standard bearers in sprinting, Tebogo threw a dash of shade in his answer.\n\n\"I can't be the face of athletics because I'm not an arrogant or a loud person like Noah (Lyles),\" he said.\n\nMaybe. Tebogo's biography in the official Olympics media program quotes him as saying he wants \"to be remembered as one of the best athletes who ever lived.\"\n\nHe's probably already there back home, a largely rural country of 2.63 million roughly the size of France that serves as a popular destination for tourists going on African safaris. The pace of life in Kanye isn't typically hectic. Maybe that makes Tebogo's triumph of a young man in a hurry ironic in a way.\n\nTebogo fought off a balky hamstring to win bronze in the 200 behind Lyles and his U.S. teammate Erriyon Knighton in the 2023 athletics world championship. He actually finished ahead of Lyles in their 200 semifinal on Wednesday. Lyles' camp said he Lyles was fine afterward, indicating he was simply saving himself for the final.\n\nPerhaps he was. Yet when Tebogo took off, Lyles saw only the bib on the back of Tebogo's race shirt. Lyles never saw the bib on the front.\n\nNot until the end anyway, when Tebogo unpinned it, grabbed each end and presented it for all world to see. The people of Africa most of all.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody,\" he said. \"The country, the continent and my family at large.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Dampf contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

We just wanted the experience. But the medal is a bonus because it's something we didn't anticipate and see from the start of our training, and I never mentioned any medal because I didn't want to put any pressure on myself. So, I just had to step up to ensure that everything is perfect from the start of the race to the end,\" said Letsile Tebogo pointing that it will be during the 2028 Olympics that he will start showing the world what he really is capable of.\n\nThis further makes him a millionaire courtesy of Choppies Enterprises' Olympic incentives.\n\nFor his gold medal exploits he will pocket P1 million and a further P25 000 for reaching the 100m finals whilst a house awaits him from the government as an added incentive.\n\nOn sunday Tebogo set a new national record of 9.86 seconds when finishing sixth in 100m final.\n\nThis Olympic gold adds to the already decorated cabinet which comprises two world medals - 100m silver and 200m bronze which he claimed in Budapest last year and another gold which he clinched with the men's 4x400m relay team this year in May at the World Relay Championships.\n\nHis success in the senior ranks follows the four medals he gained at the past two editions of the World U20 Championships, where he claimed 100m gold and 200m silver in both 2021 and 2022 editions that were held in Kenya and Colombia respectively.\n\n\"It means a lot to me, Africa and everyone who has been rallying behind me when I lost my mother. I'm grateful to them because personally I thought my career was over, but the team made sure we came here with a healthier mind. My coach predicted the Africa record because when we got to the warmup area, he told me to run the final like I did at the London Diamond League last year,\" added Tebogo.", "source": {"uri": "thevoicebw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheVoiceBW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "baitshepi_sekgweng@thevoicebw.com", "name": "Baitshepi Sekgweng", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokgweetsi_Masisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mokgweetsi Masisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohan_Blake", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yohan Blake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniversary_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anniversary Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Relays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Relays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_IAAF_World_U20_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 IAAF World U20 Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Militaria", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://thevoicebw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Letsile-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803710", "eventUri": "eng-9803710", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The 21-year-old, who finished sixth in the men's 100m final earlier in the week, beat Kenny Bednarek in second and Noah Lyles in third.\n\nLyles of the US, the pre-race favourite who won gold in the 100m, was taken to the medical tent after the race suffering from laboured breathing, and told broadcaster NBC that he raced with Covid.\n\nSpeaking to the press after his victory in Paris, Tebogo paid tribute to his late mother, Seratiwa Tebogo, who died in May and whose birth date is etched into his running shoes. \"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take,\" he said.\n\nAsked if his victory, his country's first ever gold and only its third ever Olympic medal, made him a global standard-bearer for the sport, Tebogo raised eyebrows by saying: \"I can't be the face of athletics as I'm not a loud or arrogant person like Noah.\"\n\nHis victory prompted celebrations in the capital Gaborone, with President Mokgweetsi Masisi declaring a public holiday on Friday afternoon to allow the country to honour \"Botswana's sensation\" in a \"most unique, appropriate and responsible manner\".\n\nBotswana is better known for its diamond mining, which contributes about a third of its GDP and made it Africa's fifth-richest nation per capita, according to the World Bank. Only Russia produces more of the precious stones.\n\nArno Malherbe, a former South African 400-metre champion and renowned track analyst, said Tebogo's victory was the culmination of two decades of development in the landlocked country.\n\n\"Botswana has actually been delivering very good sprinters for the last 20-years, which is a consequence of the focus it has put on this. But even within that, Tebogo is a once-in-a-generation talent,\" he said.\n\nMalherbe said the creation of a number of sports science institutes in the southern African region had paid dividends, with a number of sub-Saharan countries achieving their best Olympic sprinting results.\n\nZimbabwe's Tapiwanashe Makarawu came sixth in the 200m final won by Tebogo, while Makanakaishe Charamba was eighth. South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk, who won the 400m event at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and Shaun Maswangayi, also competed in the event, but did not make the medal race. South Africa's Akani Simbine finished fourth in the 100m final.\n\nTheir achievements raise the prospect of southern African countries emulating the likes of Jamaica, which have long been a force in sprinting, and Kenya, which dominates longer-distance races.\n\n\"Olympic golds aren't easy to get, and African countries have less money to spend on sports development than a country like Italy, for example, as this money needs to go to other socio-economic priorities,\" said Malherbe.\n\nNonetheless, he welcomed the fact that African nations were placing more importance on sports development.\n\n\"Success begets success. I was the first South African 400m runner to run under 45-seconds but almost immediately after I did it, a bunch of other guys did it too,\" he said.\n\n\"In future, you can expect many others from the region to follow Tebogo.\"\n\nTebogo's gold medal puts Botswana 53rd in this year's Olympic medal table, ahead of a host of larger countries including Mexico, Turkey and India.", "source": {"uri":

His victory at the Paris 2024 Olympics marks a significant milestone not only for Botswana but also for the entire African continent.\n\nIn a thrilling race, Tebogo surged past American sprinters Kenny Bednarek and Noah Lyles to secure Botswana's first Olympic gold medal. Tebogo's time of 19.46 seconds, the fifth-fastest in history, sealed his place in the record books.\n\nTebogo's victory is a monumental achievement for Africa, a continent more commonly known for its dominance in middle and long-distance running. His win represents a new era in African sprinting, as this was the first time in Olympic history that four African sprinters competed in the final.\n\nSpeaking after the race, the 21-year-old Tebogo expressed his disbelief and joy. \"I'm the Olympic champion. It's something I never imagined. This is an amazing moment for me, my country, and my continent,\" he said.\n\nTebogo's victory is more than just a personal triumph; it is a significant leap forward for African athletics. While three of the African finalists finished in the last three places, Tebogo's gold medal has opened the door for future generations of African sprinters to excel on the world stage.\n\nThe race was not without its challenges, particularly for Noah Lyles, who was battling COVID-19. Despite this, Lyles managed to secure bronze, though his hopes of becoming the first American to achieve the 100m-200m double since Carl Lewis were dashed. His participation in the upcoming sprint relay final is now in doubt.\n\nTebogo's historic win has set a new benchmark for African sprinting, and his name will be remembered as a trailblazer for generations to come.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long-distance running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BU-2024-08-09T005435.610-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803710", "eventUri": "eng-9803710", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

I tested positive around 5:00 am on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"I woke up in the middle of the night feeling chills, aching, sore throat.\n\n\"I knew it was more than just being sore from the 100. We woke up the doctors and we tested and unfortunately, it came up that I was positive for Covid.\"\n\nCovid woes aside, the night belonged to the ground-breaking Tebogo.\n\nThe sole African previously to have won a short sprint title at an Olympic Games is South African Reggie Walker, over 100m at the 1908 Games in London.\n\nTebogo's time saw him leapfrog American Erriyon Knighton to go fifth fastest in the all-time list.

Whether it's a medal or not, just finish the race healthy'.\n\n\"That's all I could've wished for. I'm happy I finished the race healthier than before.\"\n\nTebogo's gold is even more impressive given that he lost his mother Seratiwa in May. His running shoes bear his late mother's date of birth.\n\n\"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take inside the field,\" said the sprinter, who took a month off training and competition after her death.\n\n\"It gives me a lot of motivation. She's watching up there, and she's really, really happy.

On Thursday, August 8, the town became known in the space of just 19.46 seconds, over just 200 meters - a lightning rise to fame. It can now aspire to join the ranks of Usain Bolt's home parish of Trelawny, Jamaica, or Carl Lewis's native Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nKanye will be known as the birthplace, on June 7, 2003, of Botswana's first Olympic gold medallist and Africa's first 200m Olympic champion: Letsile Tebogo. A 21-year-old speedster who has - perhaps - made his mark on world sprinting for years to come. What pointed to Kanye as the birthplace of the track's chosen one? God, as Tebogo believes, or chance? The mystery is unsolvable in less than 20 seconds.\n\nThis Olympic 200m was a tremendous tussle in the hustle and bustle of the Stade de France. One of the densest and fastest in history, with four runners clocking times under the 20-second barrier: Tebogo and three Americans, Kenneth Bednarek (19.62), Noah Lyles (19.70) and Erriyon Knighton (19.99). The event was as unprecedented as the 100m race held four days earlier, in which all competitors finished under 10 seconds. It's as if the purple track at the Stade de France were a carpet of burning coals that had to be crossed quickly.\n\nOn Thursday, when Tebogo came around the bend on the same line as the Americans, the matter was still undecided, with victory hanging in the balance. There was even suspense in the air. Yet the Botswanan put his power to good use and pulled away irresistibly. He even took the liberty of beating his chest, where his heart sits, just before crossing the line. He had won, beating his personal record, which was also the African record.\n\nLess than 20 seconds earlier, Lyles was still the favorite. Winner of the 100m by 0.005s, he had been hoping to claim his second gold medal on Thursday evening, out of the four he was aiming for in these Olympic Games, the other two being for the 4\u00d7100m and 4\u00d7400m relays. The aim was to repeat the feats performed by Lewis in Los Angeles and Jesse Owens in Munich. In American athletics, victory isn't enough - it's too commonplace. Something even more outstanding is needed to make history. The son of two sprinters, Lyles knows his sport inside and out.\n\nA tribute to his mother\n\nThe lad likes to show off. On Thursday, his exuberant arrival on the track already resembled a triumph. He had legitimate reasons for showing off: He hadn't been beaten in the 200m since August 2021, after a disappointing bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType":

When Letsile Tebogo of Kanye crossed the finish line first in the men's 200 metres, that medal turned out to be gold.\n\nTebogo had a winning time of 19.46 seconds, which was an African record time, and the fastest time in the world in 2024. Kenneth Bednarek of Tulsa, Oklahoma won the silver medal with a time of 19.62 seconds and Noah Lyles won a very controversial bronze medal with 19.7 seconds. Tebogo reached the podium by 0.53 seconds. Erriyon Knighton of the United States finished in fourth place with a time of 19.99 seconds.\n\nBotswana has a population of 2.4 million. Known for its desert topography, the country borders South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\nThe African nation has had notable success in the past at the International Association of Athletics Federations Track and Field Championships. In 2013, Amantle Montsho won the gold medal in the men's 200 metres with a time of 49.56 seconds.\n\nAt the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Tebogo won the silver medal in the men's 100 metres and the bronze medal in the men's 200 metres. The only sprinter faster than Tebogo in the men's 100 metres was Lyles. Tebogo had a time of 9.88 seconds, and Lyles had a time of 9.83 seconds.\n\nAs mentioned, there was massive controversy in the men's 200 metres, and it was surrounding the eligibility and ethics of Lyles. According to CBC Sports, it was reported that Lyles participated in the men's 200 metres following a coronavirus diagnosis. There are questions what the proper coronavirus protocols at the Olympic Games are, if the proper procedures were followed, how many people knew that Lyles had coronavirus, were athletes who raced in the men's 200 metres put at risk, and if anyone should be disciplined for the loose coronavirus protocols at the Olympic Games.

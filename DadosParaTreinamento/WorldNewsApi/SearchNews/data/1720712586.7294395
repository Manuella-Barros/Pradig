{"id": 232047968, "title": "White House acknowledges \u2018innocent\u2019 Palestinians killed in Israeli hostage rescue mission", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed reports that civilians appeared to have been killed during Israel\u2019s mission to rescue four hostages held by Hamas over the weekend but said that the US was not in a position to verify an exact or estimated death toll from the operation. Sullivan appeared across the Sunday show circuit as the Biden administration appeared to be taking something of a victory lap on the development. He had, a day earlier, congratulated Israel\u2019s government and military for the successful rescue in a statement which did not mention civilian casualties, even as initial reports across Saturday indicated that dozens of civilians had been killed in the operation. Palestinian health officials have said that more than 270 civilians were killed during the attack; IDF commanders have put their estimation at less than 100. \u201cWe the United States are not in a position today to make a definitive statement about that,\u201d said the president\u2019s national security adviser on Sunday. \u201cBut we do know this, Dana, innocent people were tragically killed in this operation. The exact number we don\u2019t know, but innocent people were killed.\u201d While acknowledging that Palestinian civilians living in Gaza were going through \u201chell\u201d, Sullivan stuck to the Biden administration\u2019s refrain: that the blame lies solely with Hamas for operating in areas tightly-packed with civilians. \u201cEvery day that we see more innocent people lost is another horrible, awful, tragic day,\u201d said Sullivan. Israeli forces separately issued a statement denying reports that emerged on social media claiming the attack was carried out by Israeli forces concealed within aid trucks brought into Gaza by the floating pier set up by the US military to facilitate humanitarian aid shipments. On Saturday, as news of the rescue operation broke, the White House issued a statement congratulating the Israeli government. It also called on Hamas to accept a ceasefire deal with Israel, even as both governments have stated that a dissolution of the militant group is necessary as part of a path forward in Gaza. \u201cToday, Israeli security forces conducted a successful operation to rescue four hostages from the grips of Hamas in Gaza. All four were taken from the Nova Music Festival on October 7, and Hamas filmed the horrific abduction of Ms Argamani for the world to see. Now they are safe and reunited with their families. We commend the work of the Israeli security services that conducted this daring operation,\u201d Sullivan said on Saturday. \u201cThe United States is supporting all efforts to secure the release of hostages still held by Hamas, including American citizens. This includes through ongoing negotiations or other means. The hostage release and ceasefire deal that is now on the table would secure the release of all the remaining hostages together with security assurances for Israel and relief for the innocent civilians in Gaza.\u201d Sullivan said on Sunday that Hamas has not yet responded to the latest ceasefire offer brokered in part by the United States; US officials have repeated that assertion for several days while simultaneously deflecting concerns that Israel\u2019s government \u2014 or at the very least important parts of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s ruling coalition \u2014 are not on board. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to climb and aid agencies warn that the entire region is under severe risk of famine. Shocking images of carnage continue to spread across social media and demonstrations carry on in major cities around the globe calling for the war to end. On Saturday, one of those demonstrations took place in Washington, DC as activists formed a \u201cred line\u201d which encircled the White House with the aim of calling on President Biden to enforce his so-called red line in Rafah. The US president has said he will cut off some military assistance to Israel if a major operation takes place in the southern Gaza city.", "summary": "<p>Initial White House statement on Israeli operation did not mention civilian death toll </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jake-sullivan-israel-hostage-mission-b2559461.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/13/21/AP24134684655337.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6dGIGjYC-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:39:39", "author": "John Bowden", "authors": ["John Bowden"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.267}

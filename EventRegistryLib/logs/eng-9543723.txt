However, this season, they are battling to finish sixth.\n\nSo far this season, Ten Hag and his boys have recorded 12 defeats, 6 draws, and 16 wins in the Premier League. This performance left them in the 6th spot, a point above 7th-placed Newcastle United, and 6 points below 5th-placed Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nEven though Erik ten Hag won a Carabao Cup last season, and he is on the verge of winning the FA Cup for the club this season, most critics believe that the Dutchman is not good enough for the Red Devils.\n\nHence, there have been a series of speculations that Manchester United's new part-owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, is considering appointing a new manager at the end of this season.\n\nNote that Ratcliffe is in charge of the club's sporting business like transfers and appointment of coaches.\n\nAmid the uncertainty in his future at Manchester United, Erik ten Hag told ViaPlay NL that quitting the Red Devils is not in his plans.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_ogunsile@naijanews.com", "name": "Richard Ogunsile", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pogba", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pogba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Pogba-acting.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543723", "eventUri": "eng-9543723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-29", "textStart": 300, "textEnd": 311}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

But team owner Steve Cohen is trying to keep a rosy outlook on the situation, and believes the fans are as well. \"They over here because they love the Mets and care about the Mets. They are in good spirits,\" he told reporters regarding the team's fans. \"I was hanging out with them in the pub, we were having a blast. They're excited about being here and being at the games. The fans have been through worse. We're trying to break that history. They're great and certainly are going to be here for the team.\" He probably won't endear many New Yorkers with his take on the food in London, however. \"I love London. I think the food here is fantastic,\" he told reporters. \"I think it's better than [the food in] New York.\" That's the sort of quote that could potentially get a New York owner in a lot more trouble than a second consecutive losing season.", "summary": "The New York Mets are mired in another difficult season, heading into Sunday's matchup against the Philadelphia Phillies in London at just 27-36 on the\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10124131-steve-cohen-says-mets-fans-have-been-through-worse-amid-2024-struggles", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1717946673/aipsnjewihevbvngepyr.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:25:46", "author": "Timothy Rapp", "authors": ["Timothy Rapp"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.173}

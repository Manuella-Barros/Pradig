According to the Associated Press, the woman named Lizzette Zambrano, 35, filed the lawsuit against vacation rental provider Casago International and travel company High Desert Travel, both based in Arizona. The lawsuit holds them responsible for faulty electrical wiring in the Puerto Pe\u00f1asco hot tub that caused the electrocution and death of Jorge Guill\u00e9n, 43, and electrocution of Zambrano, which resulted in serious injury. The Arizona-based travel operators did not respond to a request for comment from the AP. Zambrano\u2019s claim says that the tragedy began when her husband Guill\u00e9n and several other family members arrived at the Sonoran Sea Resort, a complex of high-rise condos in Puerto Pe\u00f1asco. Zambrano and Guill\u00e9n headed to the jacuzzi to watch the sunset over the sea. When Guill\u00e9n dipped his foot inside the hot tub, he was electrocuted. The shock knocked him down and he fell into the tub, quickly becoming trapped underwater. As reported by the AP, the Mexican-American couple didn\u2019t know an electric current was rippling through the hot tub water. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying,\u201d Tej Paranjpe, an attorney at the Houston-based firm PMR Law, told the AP on Saturday. Zambrano jumped in to rescue her drowning husband, but was jolted by the current and sucked in, too. Cellphone footage from the incident shows hysterical hotel guests gathering around the jacuzzi unable to help as they discover the invisible danger of the water. The lawsuit says that the resort managers not only failed to prevent and warn guests about the hazards of the hot tub, but also failed to react quickly enough to the emergency. Ten minutes passed until hotel employees responded to the guests\u2019 cries for help, Zambrano\u2019s lawyers said. \u201cThere was not a single staff member that did anything while Jorge was getting continuously shocked again and again underwater,\u201d Paranjpe said. According to the lawsuit, a guest dragged Zambrano out of the water. However, efforts to retrieve Guill\u00e9n with poles and various metal tools only unleashed electric shocks on more people. When the manager eventually retrieved Guill\u00e9n from the bottom of the jacuzzi, it was too late. Zambrano was medevacked to Phoenix by helicopter and was discharged from the hospital on Friday. The accident, which occurred on June 11 at around 8:30 pm, is currently being investigated by the Attorney General\u2019s Office of Sonora. Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, also known as Rocky Point, is located on the Gulf of California, and is a popular beach destination among U.S. tourists due to its proximity to the Arizona border.

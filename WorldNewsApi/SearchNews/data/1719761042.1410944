Rolling Stone published a bombshell report on Combs Tuesday night, with the magazine claiming they spoke to more than 50 people in his social and professional orbit, covering his time in the music industry and stretching back to his college days. The report, six months in the making, details that Combs has an alleged history of using violence and intimidation, particularly towards women, and provides graphic descriptions about a series of harrowing incidents. Several sources told Rolling Stone that Combs showed flashes of violent and controlling behavior during his time at Howard University. In one incident, some of Combs\u2019 college contemporaries describe how outside Howard\u2019s Harriet Tubman Quadrangle dorm, a \u201cbelligerent\u201d Combs started screaming for his girlfriend to come outside. The student source says that several female students in the dorm were aware that Combs, known then by his nickname \u201cPuff,\u201d was allegedly attacking his girlfriend outside the building and began raising the alarm in the dorm. \u201cPuff is out here acting crazy. He\u2019s beating her,\u201d the fellow students said, according to the first witness. A second Howard student who witnessed the alleged attack told Rolling Stone that Combs used what appeared to be a belt to hit the woman \u201call over the place.\u201d The second witness said Combs appeared \u201csuper angry\u201d and was \u201cscreaming at the top of his lungs.\u201d The witness says Combs \u201cwhupped her butt \u2014 like really whupped her butt\u201d and that the woman was \u201ctrying to defend herself a little bit. She was crying. And we were telling him, \u2018Get off of her.\u2019 We were screaming for her.\u201d The woman that Combs\u2019 is alleged to have attacked at Howard declined to comment, but Rolling Stone says that a third source also recalled the incident. In another incident, Kirk Burrowes, Bad Boy\u2019s co-founding partner and president, claims he saw Combs\u2019 attack a woman inside the record label\u2019s office in 1994. Burrowes, who was fired from Bad Boy in 1997, and another ex-employee claim they had to separate Combs from the woman after they heard screams and the sound of glass shattering. In separate account, Bad Boy employee Felicia Newsome alleges she once had to hold Combs back when he was about to \u201cbeat this girl\u2019s ass\u201d after a fight broke out between two women. \u201cI\u2019m holding him by his waist, saying, \u2018You need to calm down. This is not your fight,\u2019\u201d Newsome recalled. The Rolling Stone report alleges that Combs was a controlling figure, unwilling to let the women in his life move on after the end of a relationship. Combs is accused of assaulting late music executive Shakir Stewart at a wedding in Italy, after Stewart had begun a relationship with Combs\u2019 on-and-off partner Kim Porter. During the alleged incident, which occurred in 2000 at music mogul L.A. Reid\u2019s wedding, Combs is accused of seeking out Stewart in his hotel room and assaulting him. Stewart\u2019s mother, Portia Labrie, as well as two of his close friends, said that Combs broke a chair over Stewart\u2019s head. \u201cHe left him bleeding on a hotel floor in Italy,\u201d Labrie says. \u201cHe had to have stitches and then [Combs] threatened him \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you\u2019 \u2026 That\u2019s when I said, \u2018You need to get out of this business. This man is crazy.'\u201d Ever since his former girlfriend Cassandra Ventura, the singer known as Cassie, filed a lawsuit in November 2023 alleging sexual and physical abuse over nearly a decade, Combs\u2019 legal problems have continued to mount. After settling his suit with Cassie, Combs faced three more suits from women alleging sexual assault. In March, Combs\u2019 homes in Los Angeles, New York and Miami were raided by federal agents amid a sex trafficking investigation. Despite settling the suit with Cassie, Combs has denied assaulting her and also denied the claims in the other sexual assault suits. But he faced further intense scrutiny earlier this month after a 2016 surveillance video that showed him violently assaulting Cassie in a hotel was obtained and released by CNN. Notably in the Rolling Stone report, three of the women who have accused Combs of sexual assault in recent lawsuits have spoken publicly for the first time and reveal that once they learned of Combs\u2019 alleged pattern of abuse, they came forward in hopes of holding the mogul accountable for his actions. Joi Dickerson-Neal, Crystal McKinney and an anonymous \u201cJane Doe\u201d spoke about their individual experiences. Dickerson-Neal, who sued Combs for sexual assault in November 2023, said that her decision to come forward \u201cisn\u2019t about money. It\u2019s about making sure the world sees that this man who rose to the level of an \u2018icon\u2019 is actually sick and has left so many victims in [the wake of his] unpunished disgusting behavior for years.\u201d Rolling Stone notes in the report that the magazine sent Combs a detailed list of questions about the new and pending allegations, but that he did not specifically address them. \u201cMr. Combs cannot comment on settled litigation, will not comment on pending litigation, and cannot address every allegation picked up by the press from any source, no matter how unreliable,\u201d said his lawyer, Jonathan Davis, in the piece. \u201cWe are aware that the proper authorities are conducting a thorough investigation and therefore have confidence any important issues will be addressed in the proper forum, where the rules distinguish facts from fiction.\u201d The Hollywood Reporter has also reached out to lawyers for Combs.", "summary": "Amid a blizzard of legal trouble, a new in-depth report has raised troubling claims of historical abuse against Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs, and allegations from former friends, Bad Boy Records employees and artists claiming the scandal-plagued music mogul was a violent figure behind the scenes.

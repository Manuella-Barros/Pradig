{"id": 231943960, "title": "Best VPN for Streaming in 2024", "text": "Proton VPN If you want a VPN that\u2019s free and still able to stream the US Netflix library, then Proton VPN is the ideal choice. Proton VPN is currently the only free VPN the CNET recommends, because it\u2019s secure, safe to use and doesn\u2019t put any limits on speed or usage. Technically, Proton VPN\u2019s free servers aren\u2019t optimized for streaming, but we still achieved sufficient speeds and were able to smoothly stream Netflix content through the VPN\u2019s free US servers. With Proton VPN\u2019s premium service, which includes servers in 91 countries (as opposed to five with the free plan), we were able to access content from several Netflix regional libraries as well as content on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus. The only hiccup we ran into was that we were unable to stream Disney Plus on MacOS through Proton\u2019s US servers, although it worked fine on other platforms. Proton's paid tier sets you back $10 monthly, $60 annually or $108 total for two years' worth of service (the one- and two-year plans jump to $80 per year after your initial term). Read our Proton VPN review. Private Internet Access The wallet-friendly Private Internet Access, or PIA, is an open-source VPN provider focused on security. PIA costs just $12 monthly, $40 annually or $79 total for a three-year subscription. Unlike most other VPN providers, PIA doesn't have price hikes, so your plan should renew at the same rate. Although PIA worked well enough for Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon Prime Video US and UK libraries. You'll also enjoy apps for nearly any platform, including Windows, MacOS, Linux (with a GUI), web browsers, iOS/iPadOS, Android/Android TV and Apple TV. Despite its affordability compared with many VPN rivals, PIA is tough to recommend for streaming because of its middle-of-the-road internet speed loss. In our testing, we clocked an underwhelming 49% average internet download speed loss. Folks with fast (50Mbps or more) internet speeds should be fine, but slower or more unreliable internet connections like satellite internet might not work as well. (For reference, Netflix recommends a minimum 15Mbps download speed for a single 4K UHD video stream.) Ultimately, PIA is a fantastic VPN with strong privacy features, but its streaming shortcomings make it suitable only for casual entertainment needs. Read our PIA review. IPVanish IPVanish is a decent VPN for streaming if you\u2019re new to VPNs and want a solution that\u2019s simple to use and can help you watch content on various streaming platforms. During our testing, we were able to access Netflix libraries from a handful of regions, along with content on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus. Although some VPNs may struggle to deliver across platforms, we were able to access each of the streaming services we tested on each of the devices we tested them on with IPVanish. The main area where IPVanish struggles is its speed. The inconsistency of IPVanish\u2019s speeds -- we clocked a high 44% average internet speed loss in our 2024 tests -- may put a damper on your streaming experience, especially while watching 4K ultra-high-definition videos. With IPVanish, you\u2019ll have access to servers in 56 countries, which is quite a bit less than other options like NordVPN (111 countries), ExpressVPN (105 countries), Surfshark (100 countries), Proton VPN (91 countries) and PIA (91 countries), so if you\u2019re looking to stream content from a particular region, you\u2019ll want to check IPVanish\u2019s server page to ensure the provider has servers in those locations before purchasing a subscription. A monthly subscription to IPVanish costs $13 per month, which is on par with most of the other top VPNs, but its annual plan starts off cheaper than both NordVPN and ExpressVPN at $48 for the first year (then jumps to $90 annually for any additional year). IPVanish offers a two-year plan that costs $72 for the first two years combined, then $90 per year afterward. Considering its slow internet speeds, small server network and mid-pack prices, IPVanish isn't ideal for streaming enthusiasts.

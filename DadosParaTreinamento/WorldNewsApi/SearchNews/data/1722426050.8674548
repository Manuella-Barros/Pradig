{"id": 243278390, "title": "CHIVIDO24: A Teachable Moment - Joe Igbokwe", "text": "The Special Adviser for Drainage and Water Resources to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Engineer Joe Ig-bokwe has highlighted a key teachable moment in the wed-ding between Nigerian su-perstar, Davido and his wife, Chioma Rowland, otherwise known as Chef Chi. According to the politi-cian, Davido\u2019s traditional wedding to Chioma, Dubbed Chivido24, offers a teachable moment to understand the difference between wealth and celebrity. \u201cWhy did the wedding shut down Nigeria and break the Internet? I don\u2019t want to of-fend people, but celebrities have been getting married before today, and we have never seen such an effect. The key difference this time around is wealth. When you have celebrity status, you will be celebrated but not neces-sarily elevated. \u201cBut when you have celeb-rity and wealth, you will be celebrated and elevated. So the moral of the story is this: Focus on making money, not just on being a celebrity. Be-cause, when you have serious money, you are automatical-ly a celebrity, but you do not automatically have serious money just because you are a celebrity,\u201d he wrote. Meanwhile, Governor Ademola Adeleke, Davi-do\u2019s uncle, on behalf of the Adeleke family, has expressed his appreciation to families, friends and associates for gracing the wedding. In a statement on his X handle, the governor thanked friends and associates from far and near for the love they showered on the Adeleke family through their enthusiastic presence and messages to the new cou-ple on their memorable and historic wedding. \u201cOn behalf of my big brother, the father of the bridegroom; Dr Deji Adeleke; my sister, Chief (Mrs) Modupe Adeleke-Sanni, and the entire Adeleke family, we extend our best wishes to all those who honour the wed-ding of our son, Davido and his lovely wife, Chioma. We pray that sounds and thrills of joy and happiness shall be our portion all the time of our lives,\u201d he wrote.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"956\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/10-6.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/10-6.jpg 1080w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/10-6-300x266.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/10-6-1024x906.jpg 1024w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/10-6-768x680.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /></div>&#160;The Special Adviser for Drainage and Water Resources to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Engineer Joe Ig\u00adbokwe has highlighted a key teachable moment in the wed\u00adding between Nigerian su\u00adperstar, Davido and his wife, Chioma Rowland, otherwise known as Chef Chi.

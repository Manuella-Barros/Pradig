Once booze filled sun holidays were the go to vacation packages for many Britons, but now spa breaks and luxury retreats are the hottest destinations. One glamorous getaway that people are flocking to is hidden away in a forest in Ballymena, Co Antrim in Northern Ireland. Whether you\u2019re looking for a romantic getaway, a girly weekend, or want to take trip with your family, Galgorm caters for all - even your four-legged friends. READ MORE: Destination a \u00a315 flight from Manchester makes a perfect city, beach or country escape While I travelled by car from my native county of Galway during a family visit home, travelling to the north of Ireland could not be easier - or cheaper - from Manchester Airport. With frequent flights, you can easily bag yourself flights for a round trip to Belfast for under \u00a330. In terms of getting to Galgorm, it\u2019s half an hour from Belfast. The transport in the surrounding area is quite well-connected and the popular spa even offers complimentary transfers to and from Cullybackey Train Station, on request. There is a massive choice of accommodation to choose from, including deluxe rooms, suites and lodges. The Resort has a range of Log Cabins, Cottage Suites, Shepherds Huts, Forest Dens and Residences set in the grounds, ideal for groups, families, or couples seeking a premium glamping experience. We selected the Shepherds Huts - a blend of luxury living with a rustic feel. Nestled in Galgorm Wood with the cascading River Maine running alongside, the dog-friendly Shepherd's Huts are kitted out with everything you would need for a self-catering visit. Some of the facilities include a mini kitchen with facilities including hob, microwave, fridge and small freezer, coffee machine, kettle and toaster. No expense was spared when it came to finishing touches, with premium gins awaiting us on arrival, snacks, and most impressively - a Dyson hairdryer in the bedside locker! The interior bathroom includes a shower room, however the stand-out feature has to be the outdoor bath on the terrace. Of course, it comes with a curtain should you like some privacy, but there\u2019s something fairytale-like bathing outdoors while the birds chirp early in the morning, or running the bath as the sun goes down beside the fire pit. With this accommodation choice, you get full access to the state of the art Thermal Village, just metres away from your hut. The famed Thermal Spa claims to be \u201cthe first of its kind in Ireland\u201d and is aptly described as \u201cthe jewel in the crown of Galgorm.\u201d Burrowed in the most beautiful landscape of manicured lawns, woodlands and waterways, you will find an absolute haven of relaxation and serenity. A smorgasbord of heated and cool spa experiences await including saunas, steam rooms, hot tubs, indoor and outdoor pools, snail shower, heated loungers, relaxing cabanas and Beltane Experience. The facilities can be accessed from 8am to 10pm and throughout our stay we found there was plenty of room for residents to enjoy each amenity without it getting overcrowded. It would be remiss of me not to mention the views you soak in while relaxing in areas such as the vitality pool. When the sun comes out, you'd swear you were transported to a tropical destination - not the rainy Emerald Isle. Though we had the sun most of our stay, it did rain momentarily one morning and I was curious to see what the Thermal Village would be like with not so fabulous weather. Needless to say, it did not matter that the weather was dull and grey because the scenery remained anything but. We would spend all day lounging in the cabanas taking a much needed digital detox in between swims in heated pools, sipping on refreshing cocktails and indulging in lunch at the Elements Spa Caf\u00e9. There\u2019s a great selection of food available at the resort including Afternoon Tea in the Conservatory, Italian cuisine at Fratelli Ristorante, filling feasts at Gillies Grill and an eclectic mix at the Castle Kitchen + Bar. With a breakfast buffet like no other and a delectable three-course dining experience, Gillies Grill came out on top for us. A highlight here for me had to be the sticky toffee pudding - the best I\u2019ve ever tasted, handcrafted by a French pastry chef. There\u2019s a reason Galgorm is one of the most sought after spa destinations on the isle of Ireland. Boasting the best of the best when it comes to dining experiences, spa treatments, luxurious living and impeccable service, it is guaranteed you will be leaving Galgorm in a state of intense relaxation and longing to wear your fabulous brown robe one more time.

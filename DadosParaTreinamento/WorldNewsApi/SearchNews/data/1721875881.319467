{"id": 239759312, "title": "Mbaoma eyes NPFL Golden Boot, friends rally Alimi", "text": "Enyimba striker Chijioke Mbaoma is confident of adding to his current 16 goals on the final day of the 2023-24 Nigeria Premier Football League on Sunday (today), hoping to emerge as the highest goal scorer ahead of his closest challenger, Sikiru Alimi of Remo Stars who has 15 goals, PUNCH Sports Extra reports. The NPFL Golden Boot Award is sponsored by chemical and oil and gas engineering solutions company, Eunisell with each goal scored by the winner valued at N200,000. Mbaoma and Alimi have been in a neck-and-neck race for the NPFL Golden Boot with just one strike separating them in the goal chart as the season ends today. Their clubs, Enyimba and Remo Stars are also separated by two points in the table and both need to win to be sure of their places on the continent next season. Enyimba in third with 60 points will face fourth-placed Plateau United in their final game of the season in Aba, just as second-placed Remo Stars with 62 points host Katsina United in Ikenne. As much as their teams\u2019 places in CAF\u2019s inter-club competitions next season are at stake, Mbaoma believes his goals will fuel Enyimba\u2019s ambition. \u201cFirst of all, it is the last game of the season and it\u2019s like a final for us. Thankfully, we are playing a home game and I am confident that I will seal it the NPFL Golden Boot,\u201d Mbaoma told PUNCH Sports Extra. \u201cThe target of goals I set was far more than this but I appreciate the ones I have and I believe it will be wrapped up on Sunday (today),\u201d the striker added. Meanwhile, Mbaoma\u2019s challenger, Alimi has been backed by some current and former players in the NPFL to clinch the award. In a video circulated via X on Saturday, former Kano Pillars defender Jamiu Alimi, for Sunshine Stars and Nasarawa United striker Silas Nwakwo, ex-Akwa United midfielder Ifeanyi Ifeanyi and others send messages of support to the Remo Stars striker. The eventual winner of the award will be rewarded with an imposing Eunisell Golden Boot plaque as well as the total amount of money with each goal at N200,000. In the case that both players finish with the same number of goals, they will be joint winners and get their financial rewards separately as it was the case of Silas Nwakwo and Charles Atshimene in 2021.", "summary": "<p>Enyimba striker Chijioke Mbaoma is confident of adding to his current 16 goals on the final day of the 2023-24 Nigeria Premier Football League on Sunday (today), hoping to emerge as the highest goal scorer ahead of his closest challenger, Sikiru Alimi of Remo Stars who has 15 goals, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.

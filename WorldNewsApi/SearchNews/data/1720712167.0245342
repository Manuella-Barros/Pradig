Carter told Southern Living his grandfather seems to be in good spirits, but is facing a new phase of life without his wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, by her side. She died in November. \u201cAfter 77 years of marriage\u2026 I just think none of us really understand what it\u2019s like for him right now,\u201d Jason Carter told the magazine. \u201cWe have to embrace that fact, that there\u2019s things about the spirit that you just can\u2019t understand.\u201d In the interview, published Friday, he recounted a recent conversation in which he asked the former president what to say about how he is doing. \u201cAnd he kind of smiled and he said \u2018I don\u2019t know, myself,\u2019\u201d Jason Carter remembered. The former president\u2019s grandson added that the fact that Carter is receiving hospice care in his beloved hometown of Plains, Georgia, must be a comfort. \u201cI think the fact that he and my grandmother both came from that small town\u2014it\u2019s a 600 person village, really\u2014and it\u2019s not near any interstate and it is truly out in the country and it is a fundamental part of who he is and who he has been for his whole life,\u201d he said \u201cThere is no other place in the world that he would be at peace other than Plains.\u201d In November, Jimmy Carter appeared for the first time in public since entering hospice care, when he attended Rosalynn Carter\u2019s funeral. At almost 100 Jimmy Carter is the oldest living former US president. Since the funeral, family members have been giving positive updates about the former president\u2019s condition. \u201c(My grandfather) is doing OK,\u201d Jason Carter told an audience at the Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy last month. \u201cHe has been in hospice, as you know, for almost a year and a half now, and he really is, I think, coming to the end that, as I\u2019ve said before, there\u2019s a part of this faith journey that is so important to him, and there\u2019s a part of that faith journey that you only can live at the very end and I think he has been there in that space.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The 39th president of the United States has been in hospice care since 2023 </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jimmy-carter-hospice-health-condition-b2559290.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/16/22/GettyImages-938216978.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/GBnWmHDX-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:38:55", "author": "Josh Marcus", "authors": ["Josh Marcus"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.114}

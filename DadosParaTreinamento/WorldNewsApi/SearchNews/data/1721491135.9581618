{"id": 237091608, "title": "Three adults including suspected shooter are dead at office space near daycare center in Toronto", "text": "A man and woman were shot to death and a male suspected as the attacker also died Monday at a north Toronto office space near a daycare center and a school, authorities said. The shooting prompted a lockdown of both the daycare facility and the Catholic all-boys elementary school, and parents rushed to the area to pick up their children. Detective Sgt. Al Bartlett said the man and woman who were killed worked together in what he described as financial transaction business. \u201cIt's our belief at this point that the altercation that took place is in relation to that business,\u201d Bartlett. \u201cThe person that we believe to be responsible is among the deceased,\u201d he added. He withheld the identities of the victims and the shooter, saying officials first had to notify their families. Bartlett declined to comment on whether the suspect killed himself or died some other way, saying it was still under investigation. Relieved parents hugged their children tight after they were reunited just outside the police tape at the daycare center. Bartlett said no child was injured. He said there was no access within the building between the daycare center and the business.", "summary": "Toronto police say a man and woman are dead and the suspected shooter is also deceased after a mid-day shooting in a north Toronto office space", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-toronto-catholic-b2564310.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/18/02/Canada_Shooting_11507.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:05:47", "author": "Rob Gillies", "authors": ["Rob Gillies"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.697}

I know it's a challenge. There's adversity going to hit. ... I'm here to help another 20 families, I'm here to help in the state and make people feel good, create hope.\n\n\"If I do the right thing, these kids will come together like my other teams and we'll compete for national titles.\"\n\nSo far, Calipari has the commitments of seven players -- transfers Zvonimir Ivisic (Kentucky), Jonas Aidoo (Tennessee), Johnell Davis (Florida Atlantic) and Adou Thiero (Kentucky), and freshmen Karter Knox, Johnuel 'Boogie' Fland and Billy Richmond -- for the upcoming season. He also has three staff members signed and announced: Kenny Payne, Chin Coleman and Chuck Martin.\n\nThe University of Arkansas staff directory also indicates several unannounced off-court staff members are following Calipari from Kentucky -- Kevin Butty, James \"Bruiser\" Flint, Kevin Gallagher and Chris Woolard. Those members and their official positions have not been announced.\n\nCalipari said Tyler Ulis, the former Wildcats point guard who has served as a student assistant at Kentucky for the previous two seasons, was joining him in Fayetteville.\n\nThe past two episodes of Robinson's podcast include updates from Calipari on the roster and schedule. Here's what he had to say on those topics.\n\nRoster\n\nCalipari told Robinson, \"You may think I'm crazy.\"\n\nThe Naismith Hall of Famer then said he told his staff that he really only wants \"eight or nine guys.\" NCAA rules allow for men's basketball rosters to include up to 13 scholarship players. Robinson responded by saying he doesn't think Calipari is crazy.\n\n\"In this day and age,\" Robinson said, \"you can't keep enough guys happy.\"\n\n\"Yeah, they're leaving anyway,\" Calipari responded. \"And why would I develop a kid for someone else?\"\n\nCalipari went into detail on why he felt that way. He said he coached six players while he was at Massachusetts. Injuries and other occurences could bring a theoretical Razorbacks roster with eight or nine players down to a similar-sized rotation.\n\nHe also spoke of his hopes for having graduate assistants who have either played professionally in Europe or recently finished their collegiate careers so they can participate in practices. Calipari pointed to women's teams using managers as practice players and said he may want a similar setup.\n\n\"Maybe we do it that way,\" he said. \"We have some walk-ons, we have some GAs, we have eight or nine guys and that's it. And there is a 10th guy, he knows he's the 10th guy.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean Arkansas' roster will definitely have that number of players, but that it's at least being considered.\n\nCalipari said name, image and likeness and the NCAA transfer portal has changed how they are approaching roster building. He pointed to last season's Kentucky team and its youth and how that presented challenges throughout the season.\n\nHe said he's looking to build a team that blends youth with experience, as evidenced by the players who have already committed. Arkansas is also reportedly hosting Kentucky transfer DJ Wagner on a visit this weekend.\n\nSchedule\n\nCalipari didn't go into detail on where a schedule for next season stands, but he gave a glimpse into what he wants.\n\n\"I want to have a schedule together that promotes this program nationally,\" he said. \"I want some neutral-site games.\"\n\nCalipari said he wants to put together a four-team multi-team event on campus and maybe a neutral site, but conceded that it may take a year to get that put together. Then there's the fact that home games -- guarantee games against mid- and low-major competition or perhaps home-and-home deals with high-major programs -- are needed.\n\nMemphis coach Penny Hardaway recently said he felt that he and Calipari could bring the Arkansas-Memphis home-and-home series back, but there hasn't been any public comment from Calipari or the Razorbacks. Calipari ended the Arkansas-Memphis series two decades ago when he was the Tigers' head coach.\n\nArkansas has two games finalized on the 2024-25 schedule. The Razorbacks will be joined by Purdue, Notre Dame and BYU at the Rady Children's Invitational in San Diego on Nov. 28-29. A schedule of games in San Diego has not been announced.", "source": {"uri": "wholehogsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WholeHogSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

From losing in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to announcing he would return for another season, and then eventually leaving Kentucky for the Arkansas job. Big Blue Nation has voiced their opinion on Calipari and not too many are thrilled with him.\n\nCalipari looks at it from a different view, though. He believes some of the fans were happy to see him leave Lexington. After the Oakland loss, there were outcries for Calipari to be fired anyway. A part of the Kentucky fan base might be happy a new era is upon the program.\n\n\"I think some people were happy,\" Calipari said via CBS Sports. \"[Some were saying], 'We've had this guy 15 years and we've only won 500 games.' [Actually 410] We only won one national title and four Final Fours and eight Elite Eights? What the hell is going on here?'\"\n\nOf course, there was some sarcasm at the end of Calipari's comment but in the beginning of his comments, he was telling the truth.\n\nYou cannot deny the success Calipari had while at Kentucky. His lone national championship came in 2012 with a stacked roster headlined by Anthony Davis. Plenty of other Wildcat legends performed well during their time with deep NCAA Tournament runs.\n\nAdd in recruiting the country's best high school prospects only to see them continually be selected in the NBA Draft lottery, there was not much to complain about.\n\nHowever, the last few seasons were rough for Calipari. The 2020-2021 campaign resulted in Kentucky's first losing record since 1989, finishing 9-16 overall and 8-9 against SEC opponents.\n\nGetting back in the NCAA Tournament for the next three years did not help as Calipari crashed out in the first round twice and another in the second round. Those kinds of results do not play at Kentucky, no matter the prior history.\n\nIf/when Calipari returns to Rupp Arena with Arkansas, it will be one of the most hostile environments in all of college basketball. Big Blue Nation will likely not give him the warmest of welcomes and boos will be coming from courtside to the top of the arena.\n\nSome extra juice will be squeezed into that game -- from both sides. Kentucky will be hoping to prove they are better off without Calipari, while the new Arkansas head coach wants to prove the people who wanted him out wrong.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_mcveigh@on3.com", "name": "Griffin McVeigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Calipari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Blue_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Blue Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupp_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rupp Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/04/10090652/arkansas-officially-announces-john-calipari-head-coach.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555077", "eventUri": "eng-9555077", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

But Calipari wasn't filled with glee as he moved south from Lexington to Fayetteville.\n\nDiscussing the move in a recent CBS Sports story, Calipari shared how much the 2023-24 Kentucky team he coach had rejuvenated him. And for it to all unravel so quickly in the NCAA Tournament at a time when Calipari thought he had a group to get back to the top of the mountain didn't leave him feeling good, both in the immediate aftermath and as he made the decision to move on.\n\n\"Last year revived me. I had so much fun with those kids and they celebrated each other,\" Calipari said. \"The way it ended ... I'll just say, sucks.\"\n\nAnd while Kentucky fans will surely have a range of responses to Calipari's assessment of the end of the season and his departure -- many wanted him gone after 15 seasons and seemingly diminishing returns while plenty would've been content to retain Calipari even longer -- the head coach was blunt in assessing his track record there.\n\n\"I think some people were happy,\" Calipari said, letting some sarcasm bleed in and only slightly exaggerating his 410 wins while in Lexington. \"'We've had this guy 15 years and we've only won 500 games. We only won one national title and four Final Fours and eight Elite Eights? What the hell is going on here?'\"\n\nAnd he made clear that he felt the 2023-24 team, as loaded as any he's had at Kentucky since winning a national title, could've led the Wildcats to another.\n\n\"I enjoyed coaching last year. I had a ball, but that was hard. Then Reed Sheppard decides to become Freshman of the Year. I asked him after the season, 'How much did you expect to play?' He said, 'Ah, I thought I'd be carrying water.' 'Did you expect to leave here after the season?' He said, 'Coach, I expected to be here all four years,'\" Calipari said. \"My thought was, 'We're going to get this,' and we had a good group coming in ... It wasn't like we were 15-15. But there's an expectation where it's only winning championships and winning that 'ship.\"\n\nUltimately, in a move that shook up men's college basketball as much as any in recent years, Calipari felt pulled to the Razorbacks. There were plenty of known and reported reasons: New scenery, a lucrative NIL warchest, the backing of his friend and Tyson Chicken magnate John Tyson.\n\nBut beyond the expected, Calipari shared there was an underlying pull to go somewhere new.\n\n\"Something nudges you and you don't know what it is,\" Calipari said, alluding to a spiritual pull to his new job. \"But I've been there 15 years. Maybe it's 'You've done what I needed you to do there for the kids, for the state. Now I need you to do something down there.'\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_graham@on3.com", "name": "Andrew Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Calipari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayetteville,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Razorbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Razorbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Foods"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/04/10131930/jon-rothstein-kentuckys-coaching-search-after-john-calipari-departure.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555077", "eventUri": "eng-9555077", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

A sterile corner office overlooking Arkansas' Bud Walton Arena is, for now, a muted tribute to what is about to take place.\n\n\"They've got this a little bit like a dentist's office, so I apologize,\" John Calipari says, stepping out from behind an empty desk.\n\nThings will soon be cluttered, complicated and all-consuming for the Hogs' new basketball coach - just not today. Coach Cal has his first new job in 15 years. He must meet people, reveal the personality that comes up on you like a three-quarter court press. Not all of those people are the much-scrutinized recruits who are populating that empty roster Calipari referred to in his introductory press conference.\n\nSome of them are holy.\n\n\"We sleep pig and wake pig,\" said Father Jason Sharbaugh, who has already spotted Cal on campus at mass. \"It's all the more sweet having Coach in.\"\n\nSome of them are tolerated. For now, the hall-of-fame coach is sharing a temporary condo with his son Brad near the center of the campus entertainment district, Dickson Street.\n\n\"They said to me, 'It may get a little loud. It's down by the strip,' Calipari explained. \"I was there Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. No problem. Friday? One place has live music, the other has karaoke, the other has a DJ.\n\n\"The whole room is like shaking from [the noise]. I'm sleeping with ear plugs.\"\n\nSome - well, one - is a billionaire.\n\n\"One of the things Coach Cal does is he out-cares any coach in America,\" said John Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods, close friend and driving force behind Calipari taking the job ... \"If you do it the right way, the derivative of that is you might win the national championship.\"\n\nThat's really what this is all about, isn't it? Not just the possibility of a natty, the actual documented proof of concept. Calipari has won one among his 855 career victories. His bona fides also include six Final Fours, 12 Elite Eights and 15 Sweet 16s.\n\nNone of them lately, of course, but at age 65, Arkansas has become the next podium from which Cal can preach. Yes, Calipari has reached retirement age, but looks 55 and has more left in the tank than an Escalade. Never one to leave flair on the bench, the coach's departure from Kentucky was as shocking as his arrival here was spectacular.\n\nIt was both the suddenness - and the destination - that astounded. Arkansas? Hogs everywhere love their hoops.\n\n\"I grew up on that action,\" said Sharbaugh, pastor of University of Arkansas Newman Center Parish. \"I just love the game. Next to Jesus, it's the hottest thing in the universe.\"\n\nBut it's also fair to point out Arkansas' place in the sporting universe. The Razorbacks last won 11 football games in 2011. A few months later coach Bobby Petrino crashed his motorcycle with a woman on board from the staff who was not his wife. Scandal ensued.\n\nNolan Richardson won Arkansas' last and only basketball championship in 1994. Eric Musselman contributed two Elite Eights in five seasons before leaving last month for ... USC.\n\n\"You could see that coach Musselman had a desire -- if maybe the right job opened up on the West Coast -- to go home,\" Tyson said.\n\nIt's additionally fair, then, to assert this is the biggest hire in the school's athletic history. Arkansas coaches have come from Kentucky (John Pelphrey played for the Wildcats) and gone to Kentucky (Eddie Sutton) but there has been nothing like this.\n\nThe likes of Frank Broyles, Sutton and Richardson pretty much made their bones here. Lou Holtz won a conference title, but bolted to Minnesota before finding the crest of his career at Notre Dame.\n\nLegends, all of them, but Calipari comes prepackaged -- oozing championship pedigree. He's got the blueprint stored in the synapses somewhere underneath that perfectly quaffed 'do. Just step aside and let him show you. It's expected, actually.\n\n\"I made the analogy, this like you have a worldwide company and it's in New York ... and you're being encouraged by another area,\" Calipari told CBS Sports. \"So you move the headquarters.\"\n\nFrom CBS Sports' Matt Norlander to Jay Bilas, virtually all the game's tastemakers hailed Calipari's move as a multi-level win - for Cal, for Arkansas, for Kentucky -- for college basketball.\n\nAll of them got a reset. Of course, Cal's move can't be recounted without a reminder that a sizable amount of Big Blue Nation wanted him gone. To that, well, Calipari can't wait to respond.\n\n\"I think some people were happy,\" the coach said of his departure from Kentucky. \"[Some were saying], 'We've had this guy 15 years and we've only won 500 games.' [actually 410] We only won one national title and four Final Fours and eight Elite Eights? What the hell is going on here?'\"\n\nThe sarcasm might as well be dripping from the ceiling. Calipari then launched into slice-of-life memories from going back to Lexington, Kentucky, for a day before his exit. Folks were yelling, \"We love you.\" A couple pulled their car over to wish him well. At Panera, \"one of the ladies came from the back in tears to hug me,\" Cal said.\n\nAnd now he is theirs again, only here.\n\n\"I'm a poor, miserable sinner,\" Calipari said. \"Please, That's who I am. I hope I have a good heart for kids and their families. I'm not a magician and I don't have a magic wand.\"\n\nIf not, he's got rights to the best set of card tricks ever seen.\n\nRegardless, Arkansas has proved it is all in. There is already talk of a monster NIL war chest. As of Tuesday, the once-depleted Arkansas roster now includes seven scholarship players. Two Kentucky players have transferred to Arkansas - Adou Thiero and Zvonimor Ivi\u0161i\u0107. FAU transfer Johnell Davis, one of the best talents in the portal, led the Owls to the 2023 Final Four. Tennessee transfer Jonas Aidoo averaged 11 and 7 for the Vols. 247Sports currently has Calipari's first Arkansas class No. 6 nationally, third in the SEC.\n\nThink of what is at stake, not only Arkansas' basketball future but Kentucky's basketball brand. What if the Hogs edge past the Wildcats on the national scene at some point with Calipari?\n\nThe transition has been swift and impressive. It was made clear by Cal there will be competition at Arkansas for a tight rotation. The Division I maximum is 13 scholarships per team. Who actually plays is another thing.\n\n\"I enjoyed coaching last year. I had a ball, but that was hard,\" Calipari said. \"Then Reed Sheppard decides to become [SEC] Freshman of the Year. I asked him after the season, 'How much did you expect to play?' He said, 'Ah, I thought I'd be carrying water.' Did you expect to leave here after the season? He said, 'Coach, I expected to be here all four years.' \"\n\nThat's a roundabout way of Cal saying he still has it. Sheppard left for the NBA after a year and is projected as a top-10 NBA Draft pick.\n\n\"My thought was, 'We're going to get this,' and we had a good group coming in ... ,\" Calipari continued. \"It wasn't like we were 15-15. But there's an expectation where it's only winning championships and winning that 'ship.\n\nThe Calipari rollout came on a recent rainy Wednesday night at Bud Walton. Calipari looked out of place at his introductory press conference. Watching him wear red Arkansas gear was like watching Derek Jeter in a Padres uniform instead of pinstripes. Some things just need getting used to. This was life-changing in a basketball sense. Ted Owens, the 94-year-old former Kansas coach who gave Calipari his first job, signaled that by making the trip over from Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe only thing missing was Cal's first public calling of the hogs. That's coming too and will be a major event in these parts.\n\n\"It gave [fans] a chance to really thump their chests and say, 'Hey we got a blue blood's head coach to come to our university and coach our men's basketball team,' \" Arkansas AD Hunter Yurachek said.\n\nAn athletic department whose budget was 10th among 14 SEC teams last year, has a modern superstar on the bench. A state of only 3 million people is hungry to rally around a gregarious legend from Moon Township, Pennsylvania who was once fired by the New Jersey Nets.\n\n\"I'm not going to try to get spiritual,\" Calipari said. Then, of course, he did.\n\n\"Something nudges you and you don't know what it is,\" the coach continued. \"But I've been there [at Kentucky] 15 years. Maybe it's 'You've done what I needed you to do there for the kids, for the state. Now I need you to do something down there [at Arkansas].' \"\n\nThe earth-bound driving force behind the hire certainly doesn't want to be considered the driving force behind the hire. Tyson, 70, is certainly the basketball patriarch of this endeavor. Yes, he is the money man of many things in Arkansas. This one happens to be personal.\n\nThis is Tyson's second run at Calipari. While Calipari was at Memphis in 2007, Tyson and Broyles reached out. Calipari couldn't make himself leave his players - especially Derrick Rose -- back then. Memphis then played for a national championship in 2008.\n\n\"I think we were close [to getting him] but that's when Cal said, 'I'm committed to my kids,' Tyson said. \"Back then kids couldn't move. Nowadays kids can move.\"\n\nWhich kind of explains the game, the climate and the reason for the move.\n\nNeither Calipari nor Tyson can remember the circumstances of their first meeting two decades ago. They bonded over talk of leadership. Tyson oversees a global food company headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, that is second nationally in the processing of chicken, beef and pork. He reminisces lovingly about his late father, Don, who admired Harry Truman so much his office is built in an oval shape for two reasons.\n\nThat imitates both Truman's Oval Office and the shape of eggs laid by chickens that are so important to the company.\n\nCalipari specializes in shaping 18-year-olds into champions for the one of the biggest brands in college basketball. His players have signed NBA contracts worth more than $4 billion.\n\nThat should be relatable to any CEO - or recruit. When Kentucky came to town Calipari would go out of his way to have Tyson at his courtside seat. Never mind Tyson being a huge Arkansas benefactor.\n\n\"He's my friend first,\" he said of Calipari.\n\nThey call each other youthful nicknames of endearment - Johnny. That's why when Tyson said it's fair to say things had gotten stale between the two parties at Kentucky it means something.\n\n\"I talk to my folks around here. There are cycles,\" Tyson said. 'Don't tell me you're going to retire at 65. There are business cycles. When we get to the end of the cycle, do you want to sign up for another cycle?' \"\n\nYou don't have to be dunked on to get the connection. Cal has signed up for another cycle at Arkansas. And stale has different definitions. Calipari once consulted former Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall, who lasted 13 years in the Big Blue maelstrom.\n\n\"I stayed three years too many,\" Calipari quoted Hall as telling him.\n\nCal stayed at Kentucky two years beyond that. At the end of last season Tyson estimated there were three options for his friend - stay with the Wildcats, chase a championship elsewhere or go do TV.\n\n\"But he's a competitor,\" Tyson said.\n\n\"Last year revived me. I had so much fun with those kids and they celebrated each other,\" Calipari said. \"The way it ended ... I'll just say, sucks.\"\n\nThe first-round loss to Oakland marked the third straight year UK finished short of the Sweet 16. The last time that happened was 2006-2008 under Tubby Smith and Billy Gillespie.\n\nThe Arkansas' hiring process took less than three days. On April 4 Yurachek was in Phoenix for the Final Four. About 1 pm PT Musselman informed the AD he was taking the USC job.\n\nTyson first called his coaching friend to ask if he'd speak to Yurachek about vetting candidates. Yurachek called Calipari that night.\n\nAt some point Yurachek cut to the chase and asked Calipari if he was interested.\n\n\"In my judgment as a businessman, either you go big [or not],\" Tyson said. \"When we were talking big, I threw out three names. I said, 'Do you call Bill Self? Do you call Danny Hurley or do you call Coach Cal?\n\n'Or do you [hire], Chris Beard, Jerome Tang. In the business world you call that a lateral move. You go get somebody who knows how to do the business. You're probably going to have to pay them a little more.\"\n\nIt wasn't until Yurachek and Calipari talked that they found out they were in the same city for unrelated reasons. Cal was in Phoenix for an NABC meeting. (He is the current president of the coaches' organization.) Yurachek was also there for a meeting as a member of the College Football Playoff selection committee.\n\nCalipari said any face-to-face meeting would have to happen quickly.\n\nTyson then told Yurachek he'd better have a plan. That is, aligning the support and resources of the university to make such a hire. In other words, John Calipari doesn't have to interview for the job. He just has to want it.\n\n\"Swing big ... who would you hire?\" Tyson emphasized. \"Coach Cal, of course.\"\n\nThe two sides connected. Calipari vetted Yurachek with Houston coach Kelvin Sampson, who had worked under Yurachek, the former Cougars' AD.\n\nCal didn't want the news to leak that he had been talking to Arkansas, stealing the spotlight from the Final Four. Then, of course, it leaked.\n\n\"I'm not mad about it,\" Calipari said, \"but it wasn't me and then it was like an avalanche.\"\n\nSpeculation and anticipation ran wild. By that Saturday night an oral agreement was close. Only a tight circle knew - Yurachek, Calipari, Cal's lawyer Tom Mars and an Arkansas board member. That in itself was unique. Yurachek had once been named in a lawsuit filed by Mars who was representing former football coach Bret Bielema against the Arkansas Razorback Foundation.\n\n\"Hunter was a real pro. He was hands-on. I guess he forgave me for all the horrible things I said about him in the Bielema lawsuit,\" Mars joked.\n\nAttorney Matt McCoy, who oversees athletic department legal affairs, was looped in.\n\n\"We just kept at it and got the contract finished Monday night,\" said a source involved in the talks. \"A land-speed record.\"\n\nIt helped that Cal didn't have an agent, a rarity for someone of his stature. An agent would have taken approximately $1.225 million of the $35 million Calipari is earning over those five years in fees. An agent would have possibly extended the negotiations by weeks.\n\nArkansas was indeed all in. The basketball world - no, American sports - gasped. Dickson Street had a new inhabitant.\n\nIn the middle of the interview in that sterile office, a familiar face ducked in the doorway.\n\n\"You good?\" he said.\n\nIt was not some assistant doing a preplanned drop by to make sure the interview didn't run too long. This was Brad Calipari, that 27-year-old coaches' son and roommate who has moved over from the staff at Vanderbilt.\n\nJohn Calipari indeed was good. For now.\n\n\"His mom is telling him to check on me every 30 minutes to see if I'm still alive,\" the coach said.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"},

Dennis Dodd made the trek to Fayetteville to interview the former Kentucky coach about his decision to leave Lexington and his new life in Arkansas. In between the stories we've already heard about Calipari meeting with Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek and billionaire booster John Tyson at the Final Four and why he made the change are some vivid details on what it's like for a Hall of Famer to start over after 15 years at college basketball's premiere program.\n\nDodd starts with Calipari's \"sterile\" new office at the Arkansas practice facility, which Cal himself compared to a dentist's office. It's one of many accommodations that will soon change. Calipari is currently living with his son Brad, an assistant on his new staff, in a condo in downtown Fayetteville. It's so close to the entertainment district that Calipari sleeps with earplugs to avoid the noise. Speaking of Brad, Calipari told Dodd that Ellen has her son checking in on her husband every 30 minutes \"to see if I'm still alive.\"\n\nAlas, this is the life that Calipari chose, and he couldn't help but get a jab at those in Big Blue Nation who welcomed the change.\n\n\"I think some people were happy,\" the coach said of his departure from Kentucky. \"[Some were saying], 'We've had this guy 15 years and we've only won 500 games.' [Actually 410] We only won one national title and four Final Fours and eight Elite Eights? What the hell is going on here?'\"\n\nSarcasm aside, Calipari did admit that the end of his tenure at Kentucky was tough, saying of the loss to Oakland in the NCAA Tournament, \"The way it ended ... I'll just say, sucks.\" Tyson and Calipari's lawyer provide the details of their meeting in Phoenix and the \"land-speed record\" in which they drew up his contract. So far, two of Calipari's former Kentucky players have followed him to Fayetteville, Adou Thiero and Zvonimir Ivisic, along with three incoming freshmen who were previously committed to the Wildcats: Boogie Fland, Billy Richmond, and Karter Knox. DJ Wagner visits Arkansas this weekend.\n\n\"I made the analogy, this like you have a worldwide company and it's in New York ... and you're being encouraged by another area,\" Calipari told CBS Sports. \"So you move the headquarters.\"\n\nLife in Arkansas is clearly an adjustment, but Calipari may be warming up to it. Remember how he didn't call the hogs at his introductory press conference? Dodd says he will soon and it will be a \"major event.\" Oh boy.

Why would I do that?\"\n\nCalipari said he's talked to other coaches who've discussed similar strategies.\n\nAccording to NCAA rules, a team can have up to 13 scholarship players. While most teams rarely utilize every scholarship player on the roster, the idea of using fewer scholarships due to the turnover that the bulk of Division I teams have endured in recent years could signal a major shift within the sport.\n\nCalipari has already added seven players to his first Arkansas roster, a group that includes former Kentucky commit Boogie Fland, a five-star prospect, and former Florida Atlantic star Johnell Davis.\n\nBut he said he wants to use the other spots on his roster for walk-ons and rely on those non-scholarship players and graduate assistants to help the team prepare for its opponents next season. He noted that women's college basketball teams often use non-staffers to help them in practice.\n\n\"I want those [graduate assistants] to have played in Europe or just got done playing and can still play,\" he said. \"We can use them in practice. The women's programs have five guys that they call 'managers,' but that's who they scrimmage against. Maybe I do it that way. We have some walk-ons, we have some [graduate assistants], we have eight or nine guys and that's it. And if there is a 10th guy, he knows he's the 10th guy.\"\n\nCalipari said his staff cautioned that an injury could create challenges with a shortened roster.

He served as Vanderbilt's director of on-court player development last season after serving in the same position at Long Island. He played for his father for three seasons at Kentucky before transferring to Detroit.\n\nUlis spent the previous two seasons as a graduate assistant under Calipari, allowing him to participate in on-court workouts and all coaching activities but recruiting.\n\nOn the podcast, Calipari said he wants graduate assistants who have either played professionally in Europe or have just finished their collegiate careers.\n\nUlis averaged 11.3 points and 5.2 assists over two years at Kentucky and was a key figure on the 38-1 Kentucky team that was upset by Wisconsin at the 2015 Final Four. He broke the Wildcats' single-season assist record during his sophomore year.\n\nHe was selected with the 34th overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns. He played three NBA seasons and averaged 7.5 points and 4 assists.\n\nUlis also played for the Chicago Bulls. His career was hampered by hip, muscle and leg injuries.", "source": {"uri": "wholehogsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WholeHogSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The former Kentucky head coach revealed on Wednesday that Tyler Ulis will be joining him next season in Fayetteville.\n\nUlis spent the last two seasons on the sidelines in Lexington as a student assistant. The role allowed Ulis to be involved in on-court activities, individual workouts, and film sessions; pretty much any and all coaching duties except recruiting.\n\nThe undersized point guard quickly became a fan favorite while scrapping his way around the court with the 38-1 2015 team. The following year he was the best point guard in the country. A Consensus First Team All-American, Ulis averaged 17.3 points as a sophomore and broke the UK single-season assist record.\n\nUlis was selected in the NBA Draft, but his professional dreams were dashed when injury problems arose. That's why he was a subject on today's edition of 'Ways to Win,' John Calipari's podcast with Craig Robinson. Their guest is Alex Smith, someone who overcame quite a bit of injury adversity in his career, prompting Calipari to use Ulis as an example of perseverance.\n\n\"He gets drafted in the second round, he's in Phoenix. I'm watching him play. He's incredible. He was fighting through screens, 300 pounds, he fought. They tried to post him -- you're not posting him,\" Calipari said.\n\n\"He has an injury to his hip and they do a surgery. Then it becomes muscles in his abdomen and that affects him. Then he goes home and he's trying to get back and he has a car accident that almost takes his leg off. What I did was say, 'Get down here, finish your degree. You're gonna be on my staff.' And he's coming with me to Arkansas too.\"\n\nTyler Ulis, one of the most beloved members of the Big Blue Nation, will be wearing red on an Arkansas sideline next season.

Why would I do that?\"\n\nCalipari said he's talked to other coaches who've discussed similar strategies.\n\nAccording to NCAA rules, a team can have up to 13 scholarship players. While most teams rarely utilize every scholarship player on the roster, the idea of using fewer scholarships due to the turnover that the bulk of Division I teams have endured in recent years could signal a major shift within the sport.\n\nCalipari has already added seven players to his first Arkansas roster, a group that includes former Kentucky commit Boogie Fland, a five-star prospect, and former Florida Atlantic star Johnell Davis.\n\nBut he said he wants to use the other spots on his roster for walk-ons and rely on those non-scholarship players and graduate assistants to help the team prepare for its opponents next season. He noted that women's college basketball teams often use non-staffers to help them in practice.\n\n\"I want those [graduate assistants] to have played in Europe or just got done playing and can still play,\" he said. \"We can use them in practice. The women's programs have five guys that they call 'managers,' but that's who they scrimmage against. Maybe I do it that way. We have some walk-ons, we have some [graduate assistants], we have eight or nine guys and that's it. And if there is a 10th guy, he knows he's the 10th guy.\"\n\nCalipari said his staff cautioned that an injury could create challenges with a shortened roster.

He's done just that, utilizing the transfer portal with veteran players. But it just hasn't been for the Wildcats.\n\nIt's been a month since the Hall of Fame coach packed up and moved within the SEC to Arkansas, a move that shocked the entire college basketball world. 30 days into his new job with the Razorbacks, Calipari seems to be rejuvenated -- in part because of last year's Kentucky team -- as he recently spoke to CBS Sports' Dennis Dodd on his career-altering move.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Kentucky high school star Trent Noah commits to Mark Pope, Wildcats' 2024 class\n\n\"Last year revived me. I had so much fun with those kids and they celebrated each other,\" Calipari told Dodd for the story. \"The way it ended ... I'll just say, sucks.\"\n\nCalipari, like most of Big Blue Nation, expressed dissatisfaction with how last year's season ended while speaking with Dodd. The Wildcats, who were once a top-10 team in the country, won seven of their last eight games heading into the SEC tournament, which gave a slight hope Kentucky had written the ship and was prepared to go on a run in both the SEC and NCAA Tournaments. Then came a first-round loss to Texas A&M in the SEC Tournament and the eventual first round loss to Jack Gohlke and Oakland in March Madness.\n\n\"I think some people were happy,\" Calipari said sarcastically of his departure from Kentucky. \"[Some were saying], 'We've had this guy 15 years and we've only won 500 games.' [Actually 410] We only won one national title and four Final Fours and eight Elite Eights? What the hell is going on here?'\"\n\nAnd when asked what was the final push in making his decision, Calipari gave an answer that he has provided several times -- including in his introductory news conference -- since taking the Arkansas job: his faith. In that introductory news conference, Calipari referenced a walk he took after speaking with a priest after Mass and how the priest told him to spend one part of it thinking he is the Razorbacks coach in his mind and the other he is still with the Wildcats.\n\n\"Something nudges you and you don't know what it is,\" he said. \"But I've been there [at Kentucky] 15 years. Maybe it's 'You've done what I needed you to do there for the kids, for the state.

"body": "The Supreme Court will give its decision on Wednesday on the latest attempt by Graham Dwyer to overturn his 2015 conviction for the murder of Elaine O'Hara.\n\nThe Court of Appeal rejected Dwyer's appeal last year on all grounds.\n\nBut the Supreme Court decided to allow a final appeal on the grounds that \"significant issues of general public importance\" arose about the admissibility of mobile phone data evidence retained and accessed under legislation that was later found to breach EU law.\n\nThe appeal was heard in January and the seven judges will give their decision on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn a ruling last month on similar issues, the court dismissed objections to the admissibility of phone data at a criminal trial.\n\nMobile phone data played a large part in Dwyer's prosecution for the murder of Ms O'Hara in 2012.\n\nIt helped to link him to a phone used to send messages to Ms O'Hara, arranging to meet up and take part in his fantasy of stabbing a woman during sex.\n\nDwyer successfully argued in the Court of Justice of the EU that the legislation under which his data was retained and accessed, breached EU law.\n\nIt was gathered under a 2011 Irish law giving effect to an EU directive that was later struck down by the CJEU.\n\nThe CJEU has ruled that the general and indiscriminate retention of mobile phone data as well as accessing such data without independent oversight is not permissible.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruled that even if the disputed evidence had been excluded, there was still enough evidence to support Dwyer's conviction.\n\nIt found the call data evidence was \"not very significant\" and was properly admitted into evidence.\n\nIn this appeal, Dwyer's lawyers told the Supreme Court that when Elaine O'Hara's murder was being investigated, there was a system in place to retain and access mobile phone data, that should not have been in place.\n\nThey said the question was whether the prosecution could be permitted to use material in evidence that should not have been gathered in the first place.\n\nThey said that Dwyer's rights under the charter of fundamental rights had been breached.\n\nDwyer's legal team also argued that the phone evidence was \"inextricably interwoven\" into the tapestry of the case.\n\nLawyers for the DPP said Dwyer's rights under the charter had not been breached.\n\nThey said when deciding on the admissibility of evidence, a balance had to be struck between protecting the rights of citizens and not bringing the administration of justice and investigation of crime into disrepute by excluding probative evidence.\n\nThe prosecution also argued the call data records were not \"inescapably integral\" to the guilty verdict.\n\nThis is likely to be Dwyer's last possible appeal against his conviction in the Irish courts.\n\nMs O'Hara's father, Frank, brother, John and sister, Anne were in court for the hearing.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie",

Some of her remains were found on Killakee mountain just over a year later and she was identified from dental records.\n\nDwyer's trial was told a Nokia phone found in Vartry Reservoir in Co Wicklow in 2013 was used to send Ms O'Hara messages, including one about stabbing, culminating in a text dated August 22nd 2012, the last day she was seen, to \"go down to the shore and wait\".\n\nThe prosecution argued that phone, and another phone found in the reservoir, were secret 'Master' and 'Slave' phones Dwyer and O'Hara used almost exclusively to contact each other.\n\nFollowing his conviction, Dwyer, in long-running civil proceedings that went to the High Court, Supreme Court and Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU), successfully challenged the validity of section six of the 2011 Communications (Retention of Data) Act which permitted phone metadata to be retained \"on a general and indiscriminate basis\". In an April 2022 judgment, the CJEU found Ireland's data-retention regime breached EU law.\n\nIn its March 2023 judgment dismissing an earlier appeal by Dwyer against his conviction, the Court of Appeal said the metadata evidence, which it described as \"not very significant\", was admissible. Even if excluded, there was enough evidence to link Dwyer to the two phones that formed part of the prosecution case, it held.\n\nFor reasons including the general public importance of the phone metadata issues, Dwyer secured a further appeal before the Supreme Court.\n\nDuring the appeal, the prosecution submitted there was \"overwhelming evidence\" Dwyer was the author of the text messages to Ms O'Hara. That text message evidence, including texts concerning the birth of Dwyer's daughter, was independent of the metadata evidence analysing the movement of phones which the jury found were linked to Dwyer, Ann-Marie Lawlor SC said.\n\nMichael Bowman SC, for Dwyer, argued the attribution of the phones to Dwyer was crucial in the trial.

that the laws governing the retention and access of personal data violated EU law, reports RTE.\n\nIt was collected in accordance with an Irish statute passed in 2011 that implemented an EU regulation but was later overturned by the CJEU.\n\nThe Court of Appeal determined that there was sufficient evidence to uphold Dwyer's conviction even in the event that the contested material had been eliminated.\n\nIt concluded that the evidence from the call data was \"not very significant\" and that it had been appropriately included.\n\nDwyer's attorneys argued before the Supreme Court in this appeal that a system for storing and accessing cell phone data was in existence throughout the investigation of Elaine O'Hara's murder, even though it shouldn't have been, reports RTE.\n\nThey stated that the matter at hand concerned whether the prosecution may be allowed to introduce evidence that wasn't supposed to be collected in the first place.\n\nThey claimed that Dwyer's rights as outlined in the basic rights charter had been violated.\n\nThe phone evidence, according to Dwyer's legal team, was \"inextricably interwoven\" into the case.\n\nDwyer's rights under the charter had not been violated, according to DPP attorneys, reports RTE.\n\nTell us your thoughts in the Facebook post and share this with your friends.", "source": {"uri": "theliberal.ie", "dataType": "news", "title":

He seems to have been a devoted father with a gift for computers and a love of the outdoors, not surprising given his youth spent in the Scouts.\n\nThe view from people locally is that Dwyer was a typical, normal lad growing up. While not sporty, he was popular in school, he liked music and was a gifted artist. His desire to become an architect was expressed early on -- he took technical drawing classes at another secondary school in Bandon, the tech (St Brogan's College), because it wasn't available as a subject in the Hammies, as it is known locally. People looking back thought him a normal, nice guy.\n\nInterested in art and design, he also played music, and for up to six months in his later teens he stepped in to play bass in a band called Strangeways, named after the Smith's album Strangeways Here We Come. It seems the group had some songs of their own as well as playing cover versions of songs by the Stone Roses and other bands. They concentrated on gigs in the local area but the group, made up of lads from the Hammies and Bandon Grammar, came to an end when its members began to move away.\n\nThroughout his school years Dwyer was popular with girls and had a number of girlfriends. Despite going to Dublin aged 18 to begin his third-level studies, and remaining there since, he kept in close contact with his friends from Bandon and would go out for a few pints on the many occasions he returned home.\n\nOver the years, he attended the weddings of many of his friends and they in turn attended his in 2003. By 2011, it was the 20th anniversary of leaving school for that particular year in the Hammies, and even though Dwyer missed it due to work commitments in Poland, it is understood he was upset at not being able to attend.\n\nProfessionally, things moved on apace. He graduated from the faculty of architecture in Dublin Institute of Technology and from Dublin University in 1997 with a 2.1 degree in architecture and became an associate member of the RIAI (Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland) in 1998. He became a full member in 2001.\n\nFrom 1996, Dwyer worked in a variety of architectural offices, including Keane Murphy Duff, Oppermann Associates, and Burke-Kennedy Doyle. In 2001 he joined A&D Wejchert Architects and became an associate there in 2003, while continuing studying part-time in UCD to complete an MSc in urban design.\n\nIn 2000, he and his wife bought No 9 Gulistan Cottages, off Upper Mountpleasant Avenue in Dublin 6, for \u20ac200,000.\n\nBy 2007, they had transformed the two-bedroom property, which featured twice in one day in the Irish Times, including a photograph of the husband and wife team who had changed it into a beautiful modern town house.\n\nDwyer was quoted indirectly as saying the space in the property was like that of an apartment, but without the hassle of management companies and with the added bonus of your own front and back door. It was then on the market for \u20ac590,000.\n\nThe couple moved to their home in Foxrock, raising their two children. Life seemed good, but clouds were gathering. There has been mention of financial pressures -- Dwyer alluded to just that subject in some Garda interviews, referring to \"massive\" pay cuts, including one of \u20ac10,000 in January 2013, aligned to his wife losing her job in the crash.\n\nAnd as revelations flowed during his trial, highlighting the hidden life he led online and his relationship with Elaine O'Hara, there were also hints from his past regarding his predilection for knives.\n\nThe mothers of Dwyer's children both took the stand during the course of his murder trial -- and both provided testimony that painted a less-than-flattering picture of the architect.\n\nDwyer's former partner revealed his fantasies about knives were not a recent phenomenon. She said when they were together two decades ago, he would pretend to stab her while having sex.\n\nThe woman, the mother of Dwyer's son, who is now in his early 20s, said that one night, Dwyer told her of his fantasy to stab a woman \"while having sex with her\".\n\nShe and Dwyer had started a relationship during their college days.\n\nSpeaking on Day 22 of the trial, she said that on one occasion, he started talking about his stabbing fantasy, after which he then started to bring a kitchen knife into their bedroom and would pretend to stab her during sex. She said he had never actually stabbed her.\n\nThe woman said she had been in a relationship with Dwyer when she was in college in the early 1990s and that she gave birth to their son in 1992.\n\nShe also revealed that Dwyer had sent a card to their son to mark his 22nd birthday last November, in which Dwyer had referred to the case and added that he was \"sure of an acquittal\".\n\nShe said she had noticed her former partner's handwriting when checking the post, and that she then contacted her son, who asked her to open it.\n\nA note inside stated: \"Everything going well here. All forensics clear and we are sure of an acquittal now we have a mountain of evidence it was a suicide.\"\n\nO'Dwyer's former partner also confirmed that garda\u00ed had shown her CCTV footage and stills from Ms O'Hara's apartment block as part of the investigation. She said she was able to identify him on the footage in the months of January, June, July, and August 2012.\n\nLater, in an interview with garda\u00ed, Dwyer said she was probably delighted that he was in trouble. Their son, meanwhile, testified he too had identified his father in CCTV images from Ms O'Hara's home at Belarmine Plaza, Stepaside.\n\nHe also confirmed he had given his mother permission to open the card from his father when she had called him last year. He said he then gave her permission to pass the card on to the garda\u00ed.\n\nHis mother was asked about July 2012, when his father had contacted him to say he would be near his home in Donegal if he would like to meet. He confirmed his father had texted him from an 087 phone number.\n\nHis son said that in the summer of 2006, he had spent some time in Cork with his grandparents. Aged 14, he had been smoking in secret; his grandmother found out and told his father. The boy said he had been planning on informing his father about the smoking himself but \"I hadn't actually got around to it\".\n\nWhen Graham Dwyer learned of his son's smoking, he \"hit the roof\" and gave him a lecture on the dangers of smoking and got very upset by it.\n\nAnother letter became one of the focal points in evidence given to the trial by Dwyer's wife, in which Dwyer referred to Ms O'Hara as \"that awful girl\".\n\nThe letter had been sent in February 2014 to Ms Dwyer by her husband.\n\n\"Do not believe the garda\u00ed,\" it read. \"They actually have no evidence, apart from my name and someone else's phone number in that awful girl's diary.\n\n\"I did know her, yes. I was helping her and I wasn't totally honest with you.\n\n\"There is another man, someone who likes Real Madrid and wears pink underwear, who is involved in this.\n\n\"I believe this girl committed suicide and this man disposed of some embarrassing items on her behalf.\n\n\"She tried to kill herself several times. Why do you think none of her family are pushing this? I saved her life once.\"\n\nThe letter also referred to Ms O'Hara being discharged from a mental hospital and that there was evidence she had obtained a prescription for eight items.\n\nDwyer had written: \"I should have gone to the police when she went missing. I might have known where she might be, but I didn't.\"\n\nMs Dwyer said she first met the man who would become her husband in the 1990s when they were architecture students in the Bolton St campus of Dublin Institute of Technology. They later married and lived in a Rathmines cottage they renovated. They moved to a home in Foxrock in 2007.\n\nShe wrote down the names and dates of birth of their two children on a piece of paper, and also outlined her husband's \"huge\" interest in model aeroplanes. She explained he ordered lots of items relating to model airplanes from the internet and would have them delivered to their home.\n\nShe said Dwyer would work on his planes every evening and fly them every weekend, adding he would also fly them at a club on Wednesday afternoons, weather permitting, having gone straight from work. he would then be home around 8.30pm, she said.\n\nShe also described her husband's computer skills as \"fantastic\".\n\n\"He could do anything with computers.\"\n\nThe couple had used the same computer at one stage.\n\n\"We both had our own sections on it. He set it up,\" she said, adding they would log on under separate profiles and that she never looked at her husband's section.\n\nShe confirmed that Dwyer also had a big interest in cars and that he would frequently buy and sell them. She said he had a Porsche 911 that he was particularly fond of and he kept it the longest.\n\n\"He called it his baby,\" she said.\n\nMs Dwyer said her husband previously had an interest in mountain biking and that this would take him to the Hell Fire Club in the Dublin Mountains. He also has a tattoo on his left shoulder which Ms Dwyer said pre-dated their relationship.\n\nAs for the date of Friday, September 13, 2013, the day Ms O'Hara's remains were found, Ms Dwyer said: \"My birthday is the 13th of September and also Graham's birthday.\n\n\"We went out to dinner, out to a Mexican restaurant on South Great George's St, and celebrated the birthday together.\"\n\nMs Dwyer also told the trial she recognised from a photograph a spade that was found in a wooded area close to where Ms O'Hara's remains were discovered.\n\n\"The spade from our garden,\" she said.\n\nJohn Flynn, one of the owners of Roundwood Model Aeronautical Club in Wicklow, where Dwyer was a member, said 35 people were involved in the club, and that he knew Dwyer \"reasonably well\".\n\nDwyer had taken part in a flying competition at the club on June 11, 2011, and had come fifth, with a DVD made of the event and given to members. One DVD excerpt showed him flying a blue and black Extra 300 electric plane.\n\nDwyer was also a member of Shankill Radio Flying Club. Patrick Kenny, a fellow member of the club, was asked about a dead animal being found at the club.\n\n\"It came to light on the day Mr Dwyer was arrested,\" he explained. \"It was a sheep... a carcass and wool spread all over it.\"\n\nHe recalled it was found early in the summer of 2012, about 10ft to 15ft behind the clubhouse. Under cross-examination, he confirmed he could not be sure about the date.\n\nAnother member of the Shankill club, Denis Brennan, said of Dwyer: \"He drove several cars. One was a Porsche sports car, an Audi estate, an Audi sports car and a jeep.\"\n\nAs for family members, Dwyer's sister, Mandy Wroblewski, said it would have been common to receive communication from her brother by post.\n\n\"Birthday cards, anniversary cards to myself or my husband.\"\n\nYounger brother Brendan said the last time he had met Graham Dwyer was at Blind Strand in Cork in September 2013, a month before the Garda investigation began. Explaining who was present, Brendan said: \"Myself, my dad, Graham, our brother James, and James's brother-in-law.\"\n\nThis was the third consecutive trip for the group and before that, Dwyer's son had gone with them.\n\nOne of Graham Dwyer's oldest friends, Colm Costello, recalled a meeting at the Dwyer home on July 2, 2012, \"We were planning the 20th anniversary of leaving school. It was an opportunity to meet up.\n\n\"I believe I've known him 39 years,\" Mr Costello said, but as this case has shown, very few people really knew Graham Dwyer.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noel_baker@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Noel Baker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/5899/2949923_20_articlelarge_dwyer_204.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778198", "eventUri": "eng-9778198", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-13", "textStart": 9621, "textEnd": 9638}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-09-13", "textStart": 9526, "textEnd": 9544}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-06-11", "textStart": 10233, "textEnd": 10246}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-02", "textStart": 11691, "textEnd": 11703}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-01-", "textStart": 3683, "textEnd": 3695}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-08-", "textStart": 5711, "textEnd": 5722}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 6179, "textEnd": 6188}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-02-", "textStart": 6993, "textEnd": 7006}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-09-", "textStart": 11320, "textEnd": 11334}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The appeal centred on the issue of the admissibility of the phone data evidence at Dwyer's trial.\n\nIn a ruling last month on similar issues, the court dismissed objections to the admissibility of phone data at a criminal trial.\n\nElaine O'Hara went missing in August 2012 and her remains were found just over a year later.

Even if the traffic and location data relating to the work was inadmissible - which, for the reasons set out above, it was not - the remaining evidence available to the prosecution was more than sufficient to establish attribution beyond any reasonable doubt. The evidence was in fact overwhelming and unanswerable.\n\n\"It follows, in my view, that there was no question of any lost chance of acquittal here... Accordingly, had I concluded that the traffic and location data was inadmissible, I would have upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal to apply the 'proviso' and would have dismissed Mr Dwyer's appeal on that basis.\"\n\nAs Dwyer's appeal was dismissed, Ms O'Hara's family members hugged one another in the court chamber.\n\nIn a statement they said: \"It is now almost 12 years since we lost Elaine.\n\n\"What began as a missing persons case turned into a murder investigation and a long, arduous criminal trial, with many challenges to the jury's' verdict over the years.\n\n\"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has upheld the verdict of the Court of Appeal. We hope that Elaine can now, at last, rest in peace.\n\n\"We would like to thank An Garda Siochana, in particular the investigating team, the detectives and our family liaison officer who have been by our side throughout this.\n\n\"We would also like to thank our family and friends for the support they have given us over the years.", "source": {"uri": "falmouthpacket.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cornwall Packet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Admissible evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_in_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Court of Appeal in Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_retention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data retention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Court of Justice of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relevance (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administration of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Court of Appeal (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missing person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garda_S\u00edoch\u00e1na", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/resources/images/18370737/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778198", "eventUri": "eng-9778198", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-03-27", "textStart": 23, "textEnd": 36}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 460136892, "relevance": 2}

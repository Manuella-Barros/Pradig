I call it a malaria burden amplifier and illness potentiator.\n\n\"Climate influences malaria burden directly by affecting transmission dynamics and indirectly through the many socio-economic factors that underpin malaria vulnerability. It is therefore imperative that malaria eradication strategies are climate-proof by understanding the link between climate and malaria transmission, its morbidity and mortality rates.\n\n\"Nigeria, like many countries in Africa is experiencing the adverse impacts of climate change on health disproportionately. Our communities are witnessing a resurgence of malaria, straining our health systems, jeopardizing our progress towards malaria eradication and reducing productivity and economic wellbeing of our people.\n\n\"Studies in Port-harcout, Kano, Jos major cities in Nigeria and other places have clearly demonstrated that the prevalence of malaria is significantly dependent on the increase in rainfall and temperature. It is therefore clear that we need a comprehensive and integrated approach to tackle these challenges.\n\nHe said Nigeria in response to the malaria situation and to guide implementation, the National Malaria Elimination Program (NMEP) initiated the High Burden to High Impact (HBHI) approach with technical support from the WHO and other partners to address the malaria situation in Nigeria.\n\n\"The current 2021-2025 National Malaria Strategic Plan (NMSP) is based on the vision of achieving a malaria-free Nigeria, aiming to reduce malaria morbidity to less than 10 percent parasite prevalence and mortality attributable to malaria to less than 50 deaths per 1,000 by 2025.\n\n\"The 2021 revised Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) includes health-related targets such as Health Impact Awareness, Strengthening Health Systems, Vulnerability Assessments, Health Sector Adaptation Measures, and Cross-Sector Collaboration. These efforts are crucial in ensuring our health systems are resilient and capable of responding to the dual threats of climate change and malaria.\n\nSalako said that by reducing environmental degradation, reducing green house gas emissions, managing waste circularly, clearing drains and improving general environmental sanitation, climate actions helps create healthier environment, thereby diminishing mosquito breeding sites and the spread of malaria.\n\n\"Also the adoption of climate smart agriculture with its potential to increase food security, reduces malnutrition and immuno-deficiency with the potential to reduce the incidence of severe and complicated malaria.\n\n\"Additionally, empowering women through initiatives like clean cooking, just transition, alternative livelihoods ensures they play a vital role in building climate-resilient communities able to adapt to adverse effects of climate change on their health.\n\n\"Mobilizing domestic funding is clearly an important strategy that we must focus on to be able to scale up actions to address the resurgence of malaria occasioned by climate change.\n\n\"In Nigeria, the introduction of Sovereign Green Fund is helping to mobilize fund for climate actions which have the capacity to help address the challenges of malaria. The Green Bond which is issued by the Federal Ministry of Environment helps us to sit down with national health authorities and influence projects that addresses the climate health nexus.\"", "source": {"uri": "authorityngr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THE AUTHORITY NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_abuchi@authorityngr.com", "name": "Joe Abuchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_human_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change on human health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dry season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_(city)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kano (city)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental issues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Health", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://authorityngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240531-WA0029.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615005", "eventUri": "eng-9615005", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Recently, she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nMalaria is still a major health problem, especially in tropical and subtropical countries. It infects more than 200 million people every year. Last year alone, it killed more than 600,000 people, mostly young children in Africa. It's a huge burden for public health.\n\nSince the beginning of this century, we thought that malaria eradication was possible, [as] malaria numbers were going down consistently year after year. But unfortunately, what's been happening since 2015 is that the number of cases has stalled. Also, the number of deaths isn't going down any longer. There are probably many reasons behind this, including that some of the best malaria control tools, such as antimalarial drugs and insecticide-coated bed nets, are not working as effectively as they used to.\n\nWe study how often mosquitoes transmit malaria parasites to humans and we study the interactions between the mosquito and the parasites that allow parasites to survive and to develop, and to be transmitted to humans. Our goal is to increase knowledge of these processes, so that we can come up with novel ideas and hopefully, novel strategies to block the malaria transmission cycle.\n\nOne of the aspects that we are currently working on is to develop new strategies based on the use of compounds that block development of the parasite in the mosquito. How do we do that? We give them the compounds the same way that insecticides are provided to them when we are trying to kill them, such as on bed nets or insecticides on house walls or other materials. Our idea is to use the same delivery methods, but to deliver compounds that can kill the parasites rather than kill the mosquito, so that the mosquitoes will not become resistant to these strategies.\n\nGenetic tools and sequencing technologies have allowed me to learn a lot more about the biology of these two very different organisms, the malaria parasite and the mosquito vector; when they get together, they form a formidable alliance to transmit malaria. When I finished my PhD in 1999, we didn't have a single Anopheles genome or parasite genome that had been sequenced. We didn't have the possibility to generate genetically modified mosquitoes. We didn't have access to genome-wide tools. Just 20 years later, we have all of this. We have the possibility to study both the mosquito and the parasite at the individual cell level.\n\nWe should be worried about climate change in every aspect of our society and definitely for infectious diseases. However, the reality is that we don't really know how climate change is going to affect a disease as complex as malaria. What's easy to predict is the impact on of climate disasters, which are recurring more and more in regions that already have shaky health systems and infrastructure. Flooding leading to roads being inaccessible, drugs that can't be delivered to the right places, people being isolated and not being able to walk to health clinics.\n\nBut there are plenty of reasons for optimism. We have two vaccines. More vaccines will probably become available in the future. We have new drugs and new ways of controlling mosquitoes are being generated.\n\nGetting a vaccine was like the holy grail for the community for such a long time. It's an unbelievable achievement that we have two. There are some challenges -- they have to be administered multiple times, which logistically can be hard when you have to deal with populations that are hard to reach, given a lack of infrastructure and health facilities. But they are a very important stepping stone. [Moving forward] researchers are already working on developing longer lasting vaccines that can be administered more easily to larger populations.\n\nThe economic development of affected countries will be key to the decrease in malaria cases. Because this is a disease of poverty. And that's where the less optimistic view comes in. Unfortunately, I don't think that poverty will be eliminated in my lifetime. Malaria will still be with us until we manage to get rid of poverty and improve living conditions for people who live in affected areas.", "source": {"uri": "hsph.harvard.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Harvard T.H.

The government has asked for the support of the private doctors across India to fight against malaria,\" Dr Shitij Bali, Finance Secretary of Indian Medical Association told ETV Bharat.\n\nIMA has 1,700 branches across India with more than 3.85 lakh doctors. \"As we have branches all over India and a team of doctors, the government has expectations that we can definitely help them. In fact, we are also ready to help the government in eradicating malaria from India,\" said Dr Bali.\n\nAccording to Dr Bali, the Health Ministry has asked IMA to access the health management information system (HMIS), a dedicated portal to look after all health issues.\n\n\"We have given them some suggestions to simplify the portal, so that our doctors can also make maximum use of it,\" said Dr Bali.\n\nNational Anti-Malaria Month is celebrated every year from June 1 to June 30 to gear up against malaria, a disease spread by mosquito bites, and make every possible effort to prevent malaria before the arrival of monsoon.\n\nIs malaria life threatening\n\nSince 2020, as many as 351 people have died due to malaria across India with at least two deaths have been officially confirmed this year by the health ministry. Maharashtra and West Bengal have reported one casualty each due to malaria this year.\n\nMalaria has been a major public health problem in India. It is a potentially life-threatening parasitic disease caused by parasites known as Plasmodium viviax (P vivax), Plasmodium falciparum (P falciparum), Plasmodium malariae (P malariae) and Plasmodium ovale (P ovale).\n\nIt is transmitted by the infective bite of Anopheles mosquito. A person develops disease after 10 to 14 days of being bitten by an infective mosquito. There are two types of parasites of human malaria, Plasmodium vivax, P falciparum, which are commonly reported from India.\n\nInside the human host, the parasite undergoes a series of changes as part of its complex life cycle. (Plasmodium is a protozoan parasite). Infection with P falciparum is the most-deadly form of malaria.\n\nMagnitude of The Problem\n\nMalaria is a public health problem in several parts of the country. About 95 per cent of the population in the country resides in malaria endemic areas and 80 per cent of malaria reported in the country is confined to areas consisting of 20 per cent of population residing in tribal, hilly, difficult and inaccessible areas.\n\nSymptoms of Malaria\n\nTypically, malaria produces fever, headache, vomiting and other flu-like symptoms. The parasite infects and destroys red blood cells resulting in easy fatigue-ability due to anemia, fits, convulsions and loss of consciousness. Parasites are carried by blood to the brain (cerebral malaria) and to other vital organs. Malaria in pregnancy poses a substantial risk to the mother, the fetus and the newborn infant. Pregnant women are less capable of coping with and clearing malaria infections, adversely affecting the unborn fetus.\n\nSymptoms of severe and complicated Malaria\n\nThe priority requirement is the early recognition of signs and symptoms of severe malaria that should lead to prompt emergency care of patients. The signs and symptoms that can be used are non-specific and may be due to any severe febrile disease, which may be severe malaria, other severe febrile disease or concomitant malaria and severe bacterial infection.\n\nThe symptoms are a history of high fever, plus prostration (inability to sit), altered consciousness lethargy or coma, breathing difficulties, severe anaemia, generalised convulsions/fits, inability to drink/vomiting, dark and/or limited production of urine.\n\nRisk of severe complications\n\nIn areas of low transmission - all age groups are vulnerable but adults develop more severe and multiple complications. The transmission pattern in most parts of India is usually low, but intense transmission is seen in north-eastern states and large areas of Odisha, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIn areas of high transmission - children below five years, visitors, migratory labour are vulnerable. Pregnant women are less capable of coping with and clearing malaria infections, adversely affecting the unborn fetus.\n\nMalaria control strategies\n\nThe National Center for Vector Borne Disease Control (NCVBDC) under the director general of health service of the health ministry has initiated several action plans to stop malaria. Some of the major malaria control strategies include early case detection and prompt treatment (EDPT), vector control, community participation, environmental management & source reduction methods and monitoring and evaluation of the programme.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat",

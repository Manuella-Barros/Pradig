{"id": 232013584, "title": "Meet Trump\u2019s New Christian Kingpin", "text": "Tim Dunn stands on the stage of his Midland, Texas, church with a wry smile on his face. He\u2019s preparing to preach about his favorite subjects: Jesus and Peter Parker. Dunn is a fracking magnate who is also a member of the \u201cpulpit team\u201d at Midland Bible Church, a Rapture-forward congregation that worships in a modern building a stone\u2019s throw from Dunn\u2019s mansion on the north edge of town \u2014 where dense suburbs yield to a scrub desert of greasewood and mesquite, pockmarked by the seesawing derricks of the West Texas oil patch. Tall and box-shouldered with a swoop of silver hair, and a disarming drawl, Dunn is dressed in a blue gingham shirt, no tie, and slacks. He presents as a mild-mannered billionaire. But Dunn\u2019s message is fierce. In a sermon titled \u201cThe Ultimate Battle,\u201d he sets the biblical stakes as a comic-book clash between good and evil: \u201cSatan wants the same thing that every epic villain wants. Which is what? Always. To take over the world!\u201d Invoking Superman\u2019s nemesis, Dunn declares, \u201cHe is Lex Luthor!\u201d Born-again Christians, by contrast, are God\u2019s answer to Lucifer and his legion of \u201cdemons,\u201d Dunn says. He describes their role as that of \u201cthe faith superhero\u201d who has been \u201cdeputized\u201d by Jesus and must embrace the \u201cauthority to reign,\u201d because they have a heavenly mission. God\u2019s purpose? \u201cTo silence Satan, through us.\u201d But here, Dunn cautions the congregation with a proverb \u2014 not from the Bible, but from Marvel Comics: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility,\u201d Dunn warns, reciting Uncle Ben\u2019s advice to a young Peter Parker. \u201cSo is the theme of Spider-Man. And that\u2019s us, too.\u201d In Dunn\u2019s theology, the responsibility of the \u201cresurrection-empowered\u201d believer includes hastening the end-times. In another fire-and-brimstone sermon, \u201cJesus Is Coming,\u201d he preaches, \u201cThe better we live, the faster it\u2019ll come.\u201d Invoking the apocalyptic battles of Revelations as if they were part of a biblical cinematic universe, Dunn describes Jesus returning astride a \u201cwhite horse,\u201d wearing a \u201crobe dipped in blood,\u201d and taking \u201cvengeance\u201d on \u201cunbelievers\u201d with his \u201cconsuming fire.\u201d Yet these same flames of judgment, Dunn insists, will refine the faithful, like rare metals, to then reign beside Christ, forever, on a \u201cnew Earth.\u201d Dunn\u2019s comics-infused fundamentalism is not a private matter. It drives his engagement in politics. Dunn is the largest donor in Texas politics over the past decade, where he\u2019s built a formidable political machine to warp state government to his will. \u201cThe Republican Party in Texas is not the party of a smaller, less-intrusive government,\u201d says Kel Seliger, a recent-former GOP state senator. \u201cThe religious right is very strong right now \u2014 and still in its ascendancy. And Tim Dunn is probably the best example of that.\u201d James Talarico, a Democratic state representative from Austin, observes the same dynamic, telling Rolling Stone: \u201cTim Dunn is spending his vast fortune to turn his beliefs into law.\u201d A notorious figure in Texas, Dunn has not previously been a power player in Washington, D.C. But with $2 billion in his war chest \u2014 from the recent sale of his fracking business \u2014 that\u2019s changing dramatically. Dunn has staked millions to send Donald Trump back to the White House in 2024. And he has formed an alliance with Trump\u2019s former presidential campaign manager and voter-targeting guru Brad Parscale, who has opened up shop in Midland. Dunn is also bankrolling a bevy of high-profile groups that are crafting an extreme 2025 agenda, one that seeks to roll back reproductive rights and tear down the wall between religion and politics. In Dunn\u2019s worldview, any such barrier is bogus, because \u2014 as he insisted at a 2022 political convention \u2014 God guides government, and \u201cgovernment\u2019s job is to execute wrath on evil.\u201d TIM DUNN WAS raised in Big Spring, a hilly desert town some 40 miles east of Midland, which was then a bustling city of oilmen and Air Force families. A ropey six feet three, Dunn played basketball for the high school Steers, where he wore a flop of brown hair and, as a senior, nearly averaged a double-double \u2014 10 points and 10 rebounds. He has enormous hands that still look like they could palm a basketball. Dunn grew up in a strict Baptist home. Attending Texas Tech University, where he majored in chemical engineering, he flashed his conservative politics, writing in the student paper that the Equal Rights Amendment \u2014 banning sex discrimination \u2014 was crafted to \u201choodwink\u201d the public, and would open a back door to \u201chomosexual marriages.\u201d Dunn was reluctantly religious in his youth. \u201cI came to view the Bible as mostly bad news,\u201d he writes in a 2018 book, Yellow Balloons. \u201cI saw it as a book of obligation and condemnation.\u201d By contrast, comic-book narratives held Dunn\u2019s rapt attention \u2014 in particular, Spider-Man: \u201cI watched the cartoons and movies, and I saw the Broadway musical twice,\u201d Dunn writes. \u201cWhen Terri and I got married\u201d in college, he adds, \u201cI would get out of bed on Saturday mornings to watch Spider--Man cartoons with her.\u201d Dunn\u2019s oil career took off in Midland, a sweltering city in the desert flats of West Texas, halfway between El Paso and Dallas. Midland\u2019s claim to political fame is as the place where the Connecticut and Kennebunkport Bushes were born again as Texans. The modest home that once housed two future presidents (and a \u201cplease clap\u201d also-ran) passes for a tourist attraction here. Since the discovery of crude oil in the region a century ago, Midland has been the epicenter of a sprawling environmental sacrifice zone \u2014 an industrialized landscape of pipelines, well pads, railroads, and oil storage tanks, redeemed only by a cathedral dome of blue sky. The rush to extract is so reckless that natural gas, pumped to the surface along with West Texas crude, often can\u2019t profitably be shipped or stored. So producers vent it up a giant pipe and set it on fire, in a getup that looks like Mordor\u2019s middle finger. The ghastly green-and-gold flames illuminate the desert at night, giving the basin a pallid glow. Most of the riches pulled out of the ground in this part of Texas find their expression in luxurious suburbs of Dallas or Houston. But Dunn has rooted himself in Midland, where he built his company, CrownQuest Operating, by making bold bets during bust times \u2014 buying up oil leases other companies had soured on. With the fracking boom of the past decade \u2014 which has transformed the Permian Basin into the rival of any oilfield in Saudi Arabia \u2014 Dunn\u2019s long-term bets paid off. A top private producer, Dunn\u2019s operation was acquired by Occidental in a $12 billion December deal that reportedly netted Dunn at least $2 billion. Dunn is a household name in the Lone Star State. The exploits of his political machine have spawned memorable expos\u00e9s by the Texas Tribune, and Dunn has been profiled at length by Texas Monthly, which first unearthed Dunn\u2019s anti-ERA diatribe. But the fusion of comic-book morality and Christian supremacy that is essential to understanding Dunn\u2019s extreme beliefs hasn\u2019t been reported \u2014 nor has the full scope of Dunn\u2019s new reach into national politics. Dunn did not respond to interview requests made by phone, fax, email, LinkedIn, and in person at CrownQuest. In fact, a cone of silence seems to surround the billionaire. Rolling Stone reached out to more than a dozen of Dunn\u2019s allies and operatives \u2014 both in Texas and Washington, D.C. None agreed to speak on the record. Befitting a man of his comic-book obsession, Dunn\u2019s Midland life unfolds in what you can think of as a fortress of solitude, carved into a dense subdivision, where his peculiar moral code goes unchallenged. A gated Dunn family compound sits astride a winding suburban lane. The next street over counts dozens of houses, but Dunn\u2019s street has just five, including his own $2 million mansion, and the homes of four of his six adult children. A private K-12 religious school that Dunn founded, Midland Classical Academy, sits across the fence line. Here, students are taught the Western canon \u2014 but also that gender is fixed, men can only marry women, and that \u201cno one can enter the kingdom of God unless he or she is born again.\u201d Catty-corner to this complex is Dunn\u2019s house of faith. Midland Bible Church is expensively appointed, sporting a sunny reception hall, an espresso bar, and vaulted sanctuary with 500 seats fanned before a wide stage. Services feature a six-piece band that\u2019s heavy on the bass. Dunn preaches that Christians should live as spiritual \u201cexiles\u201d \u2014 and boldly lead lives counter to the prevailing culture: \u201cWe want to focus our life on pleasing God,\u201d he says in a sermon, \u201crather than pleasing humans.\u201d This is especially true concerning sins of the flesh. \u201cSexual immorality,\u201d Dunn insists, \u201cis a sin that\u2019s worse than all the others.\u201d FROM HIS REMOTE Midland compound, Dunn projects extraordinary power in Austin, more than 300 miles to the southeast. His ability to influence right-wing Texas politics has been enabled by decades of aggressive, GOP-led gerrymandering, which has carved out a stark mix of ruby-red and bright-blue political districts, with very little swing territory. The state is structured to elect a strong GOP majority; the only question is what the ideological bent of that caucus will be. In most red districts, the general election is a formality \u2014 a Democrat won\u2019t be competitive. The winner of the seat will be determined in the GOP primary, where turnout is low and the voters who can be persuaded to show up tend to be right-wing activists with extreme views. Texas is unusual in having nearly no limits on political contributions to candidates. And Dunn has invested millions in tilting the playing field by backing hard-right politicians who will vote his interests, while riling up voters with incendiary messages that often have little connection to the truth. Political attacks linked to Dunn have alleged that more-moderate incumbents are variously beholden to Muslims, homosexuals, gun grabbers, or Nancy Pelosi. Matt Angle directs the Lone Star Project, a political action committee that seeks to break the GOP\u2019s decades-long stranglehold on Texas government. A former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Angle has a unique perspective on both state and federal politics. He calls Dunn \u201cthe most influential \u2014 and the most underestimated \u2014 destructive political force in modern Texas history.\u201d Dunn first emerged as a major force in Texas politics in the Tea Party era; his money helped send nearly two dozen Republican hard-liners to the Statehouse in the 2010 election. Dunn was reportedly exasperated with GOP leadership in Austin, where the then-dominant, business-friendly wing of the GOP often cut deals with Democrats to maneuver around uncompromising conservatives on the far right. In a now-infamous 2010 meeting with then-House Speaker Joe Straus, Dunn demanded that his incoming faction be rewarded with committee chairmanships. He also reportedly shared his conviction that only Christians should hold leadership positions in state government. Dunn was seemingly unaware that Straus, himself, is Jewish. (First surfaced by Texas Monthly in 2018, the startling incident was confirmed by Straus in an event at the University of Texas this April. \u201cIt was a pretty unsatisfactory meeting,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe never met again.\u201d) Dunn has since established himself as the largest donor in state politics. Since 2015, he\u2019s steered more than $24 million in disclosed contributions to politicians and political action committees that push his religious-right agenda. Dunn\u2019s undisclosed \u201cdark money\u201d spending is also prodigious, reportedly spread among a matrix of nonprofits. Here, his fingerprints are sometimes visible through board memberships: He is a director of Convention of States Action, for example, a far-right group that ominously seeks to rewrite the U.S. Constitution. In speeches to this group, Dunn has overtly mixed religion and politics, including with the declaration that \u201cGod\u2019s on our side.\u201d Dunn has a megadonor partner in his Texas operations \u2014 a fellow oil billionaire and zealot named Farris Wilks, who has spent more than $14 million over the same time frame. \u200b\u200bWilks is also a preacher, who heads the Assembly of Yahweh near Cisco, Texas, which grounds its worship in the Old Testament, eschews Christmas and Easter as \u201crooted in paganism,\u201d and says abortion is \u201cmurder\u201d and homosexuality is \u201ca grievous sin.\u201d The son of a bricklayer, Wilks is as crude as Dunn is refined. Texas politicos often refer to them with a moniker befitting a country duo \u2014 \u201cWilks and Dunn\u201d \u2014 or a law firm \u2014 \u201cDunn and Wilks.\u201d The exact contours of their partnership is unclear, but Dunn and Wilks have wielded power through a rotating series of PACs that they\u2019ve staked with seven-figure checks, beginning with Empower Texans in 2006, morphing into Defend Texas Liberty in 2020, and relaunched this year as Texans United for a Conservative Majority. (Wilks didn\u2019t respond to interview requests.) The Dunn and Wilks political machine has three essential components: The first is a think tank \u2014 the Texas Public Policy Foundation, where Dunn is the longtime vice chair, which develops far-right policy proposals. Second is the massive campaign war chest that backs politicians who vow to fight for such an agenda. The third is a ranking \u2014 published at the site Texas Scorecard \u2014 which tracks votes on key bills that attempt to turn the favored policies into law. Christopher Tackett is a transparency watchdog who charts the influence of big money at the website TX Campaign Finance. He describes how the Texas Public Policy Foundation crafts model legislation for Dunn- and Wilks-backed lawmakers to then push in Austin. \u201cThey\u2019re not only helping [politicians] get elected, they\u2019re writing the bills,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a couple of billionaires taking their individual voices and turning them into a chorus.\u201d Kel Seliger is a Republican who served in the state Senate until 2023. Dunn was a constituent, and Seliger, who is Jewish, clashed with Dunn\u2019s machine. Seliger compares Dunn and Wilks to Russian oligarchs whose approach to politics is \u201cfundamentally corrupt.\u201d They go beyond the influence that often accrues to large donors, Seliger insists, and have been \u201cbuying offices in the state Legislature\u201d and installing loyalists who \u201cdo exactly what they say\u201d \u2014 either out of conviction or because they\u2019re \u201cscared to death about the Texas Scorecard.\u201d Texas Republicans who rank high on the scorecard can expect election support. Those whose ratings slip must anticipate a bruising and expensive primary challenge from even-further-right contenders. \u201cIf you don\u2019t meet all of their litmus tests, then you\u2019re a \u2018liberal,\u2019\u2009\u201d Seliger says. (The self-described Reagan Republican is no squish. His record included championing Texas\u2019 \u201ccastle doctrine bill,\u201d giving gun owners the right to use deadly force to protect their homes. But, he says, he never scored better than 60 percent on the Dunn and Wilks scorecard.) Lawmakers supported by Dunn and Wilks have enacted one of the nation\u2019s harshest abortion bans, as well as laws to ban supposedly \u201cexplicit\u201d books from school libraries; to curb access to pornography; and to replace school counselors with religious chaplains. They\u2019ve also pushed, unsuccessfully, to post the Ten Commandments in public classrooms, and to defund public education with private-school vouchers. The cadre of Dunn and Wilks loyalists includes not only rank-and-file legislators, but also statewide officeholders like Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick \u2014 a former right-wing AM-radio jockey nicknamed the \u201cSilver Tongued Devil\u201d \u2014 who has received $3 million in campaign cash and loans from Dunn-backed groups; and Attorney General Ken Paxton \u2014 a Trumpian figure who has implausibly kept criminal charges, and an impeachment effort by members of his own party, at bay. Dunn has donated $755,000 directly to Paxton. \u201cThe far-right people are running things,\u201d Seliger insists. \u201cThey are now the establishment.\u201d Republican insiders describe the GOP-run Texas Senate, where Patrick is the presiding officer, as fully under the sway of the Dunn and Wilks machine, while a civil war for control of the House remains in full swing. This dynamic was manifest in the recent impeachment of Paxton on bribery and other serious charges. Republicans in the House sent more than a dozen articles of impeachment to the upper chamber. But the Senate, where Patrick managed the trial, acquitted Paxton completely. In primary contests that culminated in late May, the Dunn faction made big strides in its bid to control the House, replacing 15 GOP incumbents with hard-liners. The offensive fell just short of total victory. Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan \u2014 who leads the chamber\u2019s more-moderate wing \u2014 eked out a win by fewer than 400 votes, besting a challenger who had received more than $800,000 from Dunn and Wilks\u2019 new PAC. Even rock-ribbed Republicans weren\u2019t safe from getting ousted. Glenn Rogers is a cattle rancher and doctor of veterinary medicine who lost the GOP primary race for his rural House seat, outside of Fort Worth. Rogers made himself a target by voting against school vouchers \u2014 \u201cThey want to just create a state-supported system of religious schools, basically,\u201d he says \u2014 and in favor of impeaching Paxton. The Republican describes running against a well-funded machine that played dirty, blasting him as anti-gun, despite his endorsements from the NRA and the Texas Rifle Association. \u201cThey support some of the most horrific lies you\u2019ve ever seen, and character assassinations. The truth just doesn\u2019t seem to matter,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to understand how someone that claims to be a Christian can do that.\u201d Dunn\u2019s critics in the GOP say the billionaire\u2019s ultimate agenda is to impose a \u201ctheocracy\u201d on Texas. Even coming from Republicans such talk can sound hyperbolic \u2014 until you examine the logo for Dunn and Wilks\u2019 latest front group, Texans United for a Conservative Majority: It features a silhouette of the Texas Statehouse, but replaces the Goddess of Liberty statue atop the Capitol dome with a stark, white cross. Dunn\u2019s agenda is \u201cquite frightening to me,\u201d Rogers tells Rolling Stone. \u201cThey want Texas ruled according to their version of Christianity \u2014 rigid Christianity.\u201d Rogers is himself a believer who argues that public leaders should be guided by faith. But he says \u201cthat\u2019s different from Christian nationalism. Christianity is about love. And Christian nationalism is about power.\u201d DUNN DOES NOT have a formal title at Midland Bible, but the church website features scores of his Sunday sermons. Unlike pastors who are paid for their services, Dunn has dad-joked from the pulpit that he is \u201cgood, for nuthin\u2019.\u201d Dunn has an analytical mind, and he quotes scripture \u2014 literally chapter and verse \u2014 with the confidence of a man who has broken down and rebuilt Gospel as if it were the engine on a \u201967 Chevy. Dunn balances his comic-book callouts \u2014 he peppers in references to Batman Begins, The Avengers, and Justice League \u2014 with a bookish theology. He contends that society\u2019s conceptions of heaven and hell, for example, have been \u201cpolluted with Greek syncretism\u201d \u2014 a word describing a mashup of faith traditions. In Yellow Balloons, Dunn writes that his own religious awakening emerged from a rupture with a business colleague, more than two decades ago. The friend had lashed out at him as \u201carrogant,\u201d accusing him of failing to \u201cacknowledge people\u201d and relying on \u201cintimidation to get your way.\u201d Dunn was stung by what he recognized was the truth \u2014 that he \u201cwould stomp on people without even noticing.\u201d He came to understand himself as a \u201cself-o-holic\u201d who \u201cwanted to be in control, but without taking responsibility.\u201d For Dunn, this was a literal come-to-Jesus moment: \u201cI realized and admitted my failure [and] God demolished me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe pain I felt during that period really was a sort of death.\u201d But rich men who give themselves soapboxes \u2014 in the form of self-published books or speaking roles at church \u2014 have a tendency to tell on themselves. And Dunn is no exception. From the pulpit, Dunn admits to battling a God complex. \u201cI get tapped on the shoulder fairly often. And Jesus says, \u2018Excuse me, you\u2019re sitting in my chair.\u2019\u2009\u201d He describes a knee-jerk petulance: \u201cI very effortlessly can channel my inner four-year-old at any time.\u201d And he confesses his struggle with megalomania: \u201c\u2009\u2018Be a tyrant ruler. You should ascend to the most high\u2019 \u2014 I hear that voice all day long, every day.\u201d Dunn often describes how \u201cannoying\u201d he finds fundamental precepts of his faith \u2014 as if this were a common experience. The long list includes: attending church, being hospitable, being loving and patient, and \u201cwalking in the spirit.\u201d While Dunn writes that the conflict with his old friend put him on a holier path, he also admits that his \u201cbase nature\u201d has not changed, that his \u201cinstincts are still selfish\u201d \u2014 and that \u201cmy personality profile is that I am a J-E-R-K.\u201d With the canniness of an engineer, however, Dunn has solved this character flaw by becoming a Jerk for Jesus. In Dunn\u2019s through-the-looking-glass view, \u201cniceness\u201d \u2014 by which he means tolerance of unbiblical behavior by others \u2014 is \u201ccowardice\u201d by another name. And cowardice, he preaches, is an arch sin that will get you tossed in the \u201clake of fire.\u201d \u201cThe Bible never calls us to be nice,\u201d Dunn preaches. \u201cYou have to applaud evil if you want to be nice.\u201d In Dunn\u2019s view, Christians \u201caren\u2019t called to merely cope with the evil of this world. We\u2019re called to fight it and to overcome it.\u201d As a result, Dunn views imposing the harsh constraints of his own faith on others as the very definition of Christian love: \u201cWe\u2019re doing people a huge favor,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen we get in their face.\u201d The negative reaction of those who are on a different path is, to Dunn, affirmation of his righteousness: \u201cThe more superhero-like things we do, the more the world is likely to \u2026 hate us,\u201d he writes. This belief shapes Dunn\u2019s ideas about how Christians should engage in what he calls the \u201cdarkest of all arenas in this world, which is politics.\u201d In a 2019 speech to a Convention of States Action summit titled \u201cThe Bible and Politics,\u201d Dunn declared that Christians are \u201cmade to rule and reign,\u201d and he described this terrestrial life as a proving ground \u2014 to see who will take on the mantle to govern alongside Jesus in the \u201ckingdom to come.\u201d Dunn calls on believers to be the \u201cfragrance\u201d of Christ in the world. \u201cWhen we live according to the way God has asked us to live,\u201d he preaches, \u201cpeople smell it. They sense it.\u201d The scent of Dunn\u2019s political operation, however, is hardly sweet. In fact, much of it stinks to high heaven. \u201cThey are serious about their theocracy,\u201d says Angle, \u201cbut they know that in order to impose it on others, they have to have some pretty bad actors \u2014 and some of those bad actors are sinners.\u201d The incongruously scandal-plagued Dunn political machine relies on GOP operatives and enforcers who have behaved so atrociously that entire front groups have had to be shut down and rebranded. \u201cThey keep embarrassing themselves,\u201d says Seliger, calling the behavior \u201cjust indecent.\u201d For more than a decade, Dunn\u2019s political donations flowed through a PAC called Empower Texans. However, in 2020, two top Empower Texans operatives aired an unedited version of a podcast that included profanity-laced, hot-mic chatter, in which the pair belittled Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for having to use a wheelchair \u2014 leading one prominent GOP lawmaker to blast the Dunn operation as a \u201csanctimonious sewer.\u201d Empower Texans was dissolved that October, leading to the rise of Defend Texas Liberty as Dunn\u2019s primary PAC. The rebranding had the effect of putting lipstick on a pig. A top Texas lawmaker backed by the Dunn machine was a state representative named Bryan Slaton, who took $275,000 in campaign cash from Dunn directly, and more than $300,000 from Dunn-backed PACs. Slaton fit the model of a Dunn and Wilks conservative: a former youth pastor who acted as a far-right provocateur in the Statehouse \u2014 including introducing a bill that could have punished women seeking abortions with the death penalty. But last May, Slaton became the first member of the Texas House to be expelled in more than 90 years \u2014 after a state investigation accused the married legislator of taking a 19-year-old aide to his apartment and getting her drunk to the point of \u201csplit vision.\u201d Slaton allegedly had sex with the woman, a virgin, repeatedly. He then pressured his employee to keep quiet. House investigators judged that \u201cthe only appropriate discipline\u201d was expulsion. The House vote was unanimous. Then, last fall, a whiff of neo-Nazism hit Dunn\u2019s operation. Defend Texas Liberty\u2019s president was an operative named Jonathan Strickland \u2014 a former pest-control technician turned state legislator whose political career had been propelled by $214,000 in contributions from Dunn directly, and nearly $268,000 from Empower Texans. Defend Texas Liberty worked with Strickland\u2019s political consultancy, Pale Horse Strategies. And Strickland, in early October, hosted a long meeting at his political office with Nick Fuentes, a ferocious antisemite and Holocaust denier. Dunn is frequently characterized as a puppetmaster of the Texas GOP. In this scandal, however, he became a ventriloquist. His mea culpa was delivered by a politician whom Defend Texas Liberty had staked $3 million in campaign cash and loans: Lt. Gov. Patrick. \u201cI spoke with Tim Dunn, a principal funder of Defend Texas Liberty PAC, and he has told me unequivocally that it was a serious blunder for PAC President Jonathan Stickland to meet with white supremacist Nick Fuentes,\u201d Patrick said publicly. Defend Texas Liberty was promptly shuttered, but replaced within weeks by a new PAC: Texans United for a Conservative Majority. In addition to its eerie Christian-cross logo, the PAC website declares that its mission is to root out \u201cDemocrat-enabling lawmakers who are Republicans in name only (RINOs)\u201d and \u2014 evoking Trumpy rhetoric \u2014 to drain \u201cthe Austin Swamp.\u201d FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY influence in the Lone Star State, Dunn has never been a power player in presidential politics. But for 2024, he\u2019s taking his operation national. Dunn now stands as an avatar of the extreme oil wealth and Christian nationalism that have hitched in as engines behind the Trump train. Dunn established himself as one of Trump\u2019s newest and largest megadonors in December, cutting a $5 million check to Make America Great Again Inc., a pro-Trump Super PAC. This was by far Dunn\u2019s largest federal contribution. Dunn has spoken rarely, but admiringly, of Trump\u2019s fortitude. In a 2019 address, he praised Trump for having once dressed down a room full of pastors in a manner Dunn found \u201cvery accurate, very prophetic\u201d \u2014 \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019ve gotten soft.\u2019\u2009\u201d The MAGA Inc. ads Dunn is helping pay for reflect his dark worldview. One features a voice-over in which Trump presents himself as a demigod of cultural revenge: \u201cI am your warrior, I am your justice,\u201d he intones. \u201cAnd for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.\u201d Dunn has also taken on a new sidekick in Brad Parscale, a former top Trumpworld operative, credited with orchestrating a massive campaign of micro-targeted Facebook ads in 2016 that helped Trump topple the Hillary Clinton juggernaut. Parscale parlayed that success into a short-lived stint as Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2020. Parscale bought a home just blocks from Dunn\u2019s Midland compound in January 2023, and he\u2019s putting in the time in West Texas. This reporter found him at home on a Monday morning and spoke to Parscale through an electronic-doorbell device: \u201cDon\u2019t show up at my house, dude,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to Rolling Stone.\u201d In a deal brokered by Parscale, Dunn has invested $7.5 million in a firm called AiAdvertising, which touts its capacity to harness \u201crich customer data\u201d and a \u201cgenerative AI process\u201d to deliver \u201chyper-personalized content.\u201d The technology holds the promise to micro-target AI-personalized political ads to voters \u2014 in essence turbocharging the online persuasion work that made Parscale famous. In Texas politics, Dunn has described himself in football terms, as an \u201coffensive coordinator.\u201d But it would be fair to characterize his national plans for 2024 as a blitz. Dunn is also backing a host of political groups that seek to craft a second-term Trump agenda. In 2021, Dunn signed on as a founding director of the America First Policy Institute. The CEO of AFPI is Brooke Rollins, who served in the White House as Trump\u2019s domestic-policy adviser. But before Rollins was Trump\u2019s wingman, she was Dunn\u2019s. She served for years as CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, the drivetrain of Dunn\u2019s political machine. Rollins has long acted as a spokeswoman for Dunn. In a 2014 interview, she defended his political influence, insisting, \u201cThis narrative that he\u2019s the really bad guy behind the curtain is unfair, because what he\u2019s trying to do is change the country.\u201d Rollins recently described to The Wall Street Journal how she approached Dunn to help launch AFPI, seeking \u201cto create a national organization, similar to what we built in Texas, that could be ready for a second term.\u201d (Rollins and AFPI didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.) The AFPI agenda includes tearing down the wall between church and state. In a document called \u201cBiblical Foundations: Ten Pillars for Restoring a Nation Under God!,\u201d AFPI insists \u201cFaith and Politics DO Mix in America.\u201d It contends \u201cthe Church is God\u2019s force for good in the world and the United States\u201d and it \u201cdoes not end where government begins.\u201d Rollins isn\u2019t the only past Texas Public Policy Foundation leader now seeking to shape a second Trump term. Kevin Roberts succeeded Rollins as chief executive officer of the Texas think tank, and in 2021 became president of the Heritage Foundation. Roberts has steered the once establishment-conservative group away from market economics and headlong into the culture wars \u2014 insisting that the \u201cradical\u201d agenda of the \u201cgender cult\u201d is an \u201call-out assault on human flourishing,\u201d and arguing that \u201cmovement conservatives\u201d can\u2019t back gay marriage because it \u201ccontravenes our understanding of an enduring moral order.\u201d Heritage has notoriously organized \u2014 in collaboration with dozens of far-right groups \u2014 an initiative called Project 2025, which seeks to drive Trump\u2019s Day One agenda. Its extreme priorities include imprisoning porn producers, repealing same-sex marriage rights, and using the Comstock Act to prevent the distribution of abortion drugs by mail. Dunn is also reportedly a significant donor to a group called the Center for Renewing America \u2014 tagline: \u201cFor God. For Country. For Community\u201d \u2014 led by Trump\u2019s former Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought. Vought was a controversial appointee because of his stark dogma, including an op-ed he wrote insisting that Muslims \u201cstand condemned\u201d because they \u201chave rejected Jesus Christ.\u201d The original link between Dunn and Vought is unclear, but according to Vought\u2019s public White House calendars, he and Dunn met twice at the White House. (Roberts, Vought, and CRA did not respond to interview requests.) Founded in 2021, CRA is also crafting priorities for a second Trump term \u2014 and CRA\u2019s 2023 annual report describes Vought as an \u201cindispensable part of Project 2025.\u201d In addition, Vought\u2019s outfit drew national scrutiny after Politico reported on internal CRA documents that listed \u201cChristian Nationalism\u201d as a top priority for a second Trump term. That agenda was not laid out in detail. However, Vought posted on X in early 2023 that he\u2019d been developing a \u201csound Christian Nationalism\u201d with former Trump official William E. Wolfe, who was then a CRA visiting fellow. Wolfe, in turn, helped edit a \u201cStatement of Christian Nationalism.\u201d It reads in part: \u201cWe deny that Jesus\u2019 kingship and lordship are merely heavenly or that His Word is only authoritative over confessing Christians.\u201d \u201cWe deny that the purpose of civil government is to establish a secular, neutral, or godless order.\u201d \u201cFull obedience to Christ today is an indisputable obligation of all [governments].\u201d In an April op-ed, Dunn wrote that he rejects the \u201cdisparagement\u201d that he is a Christian nationalist \u2014 which he called \u201ca made-up label that conflicts with biblical teaching\u201d and was objectionable primarily because it deprioritizes his identity as a Christian. Dunn asserted that his vision is not \u201cauthoritarian,\u201d pointing to Americans\u2019 \u201cGod-given free will to believe in him (or not), pursue their own dreams, and make and bear the consequences of their own choices.\u201d Dunn\u2019s critics and admirers alike insist his sudden entrance into national politics must be taken seriously. Rollins has boasted it\u2019s the start of a \u201c100-year play.\u201d Angle, the Lone Star Project director, believes Dunn is attracted to the no-holds-barred politics that surround Trump \u2014 and remind him of Texas: \u201cHe sees, in what Trump\u2019s done to the Republican Party nationally, exactly the type of environment he can operate in \u2014 and really start to dominate.\u201d Angle\u2019s stark advice for Americans unfamiliar with the political ambitions of Dunn & Co.? \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate where they\u2019re going. Do not underestimate the lengths that they will go in order to consolidate power.\u201d", "summary": "Oil-rich Tim Dunn has changed Texas politics with fanatical zeal \u2014 the national stage is next", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/tim-dunn-texas-oil-billionaire-trump-donor-1235033143/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/R1389_NAT-AFF_Tim-Dunn_A.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:00:00", "author": "Jason Maxey,Tim Dickinson", "authors": ["Jason Maxey", "Tim Dickinson"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.352}

On Saturday, June 8, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model, both 28, headed to Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City for a cute date night \u2014 and to support the local men's professional soccer club. The couple showed their support for Sporting Kansas City \u2014 and showed off their couple\u2019s style \u2014 in matching blue jerseys for the match, which saw the local team defeat Seattle Sounders FC with a final score of 2 to 1. Ahead of the game, Brittany shared selfies of the pair on Instagram Stories, posing with Patrick, who paired his jersey with sunnies, a baseball cap and a stack of chains. The mom of two also shared a video of the couple in their matching jerseys at the game, making a kissy face while her quarterback beau gave a soft smile for the camera. After Kansas City defeated Seattle, Brittany headed to T-Mobile Center to watch Tim McGraw in concert for his Standing Room Only Tour. She did not share whether Patrick joined her for the show, but she did share several posts from the concert, including one that read, \u201cStraight from sports to country music. My type of day.\u201d Brittany also shared a couple of clips from the show, including the country star singing his hit song \u201cLive Like You Were Dying\u201d and a nod to her friend Taylor Swift. The star shared a clip of McGraw performing his 2013 song featuring Swift and Keith Urban, \u201cHighway Don't Care,\u201d which included a clip of the Swift singing on the big screen. The nod was extra appropriate, given that McGraw was performing in Kansas City, where Swift made frequent visits last NFL season to hang with Brittany as they watched Patrick and Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, help lead the Chiefs to a Super Bowl win.

Patrick and Brittany\u2019s big day out at the Sporting game is fitting, given that they are both fixtures in the Kansas City football scene, but also co-owners of another team in the city, the Kansas City Current. It also marked a parents' day out for the high school sweethearts, who share son Patrick \"Bronze\" Lavon III, 18 months, and daughter Sterling Skye, 3.", "summary": "Brittany headed straight from the game to a Tim McGraw concert, where she posted a nod to friend Taylor Swift", "url": "https://people.com/patrick-brittany-mahomes-wear-matching-jerseys-soccer-game-date-tim-mcgraw-concert-8660587", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/h-J4KtAYmXCHXRoYYKXyXYJg6Jg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(743x274:745x276)/brittany-patrick-mahomes-tout-060924-cf7c7a8254f64c379efc3358a7657fcb.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:33:36", "author": "Bailey Richards", "authors": ["Bailey Richards"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.423}

And in his remarks Wednesday, Biden directly blamed Trump for that failure.\n\nTrump, Biden said, \"came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the eighth wonder of the world.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me? Look what happened. They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it,\" the president said.\n\n\"Foxconn turned out to be just that - a con,\" Biden added. \"Go figure.\"\n\nThe sprawling stretch of Racine County, which sits between Chicago and Milwaukee, has been at the center of an intense local political debate over the development through one whipsaw election after another. Residents who live and work nearby told CNN they were happy to see the projects -- and the jobs -- but it was hardly a guarantee that their own economic anxieties would be allayed.\n\n\"Things are really uncertain, not knowing what's going to happen with interest rates and what's going to happen with the whole economy,\" said Dave Flannery, whose family operates the Apple Holler orchard and farm just a few miles from where Biden is set to visit on Wednesday. \"Personally, I'm very optimistic in terms of our future, but at times it's very scary out there.\"\n\nTom Oberhaus, whose family owns Cozy Nook Farm about an hour away near Waukesha, said inflation is one of the biggest criticisms he has about the Biden administration. While he's not a huge admirer of Trump and hoped for a Republican alternative, he said he would gladly return to the economic policies of the Trump era.\n\n\"You get your paycheck and it looks good, but when you pay the bills out, it's like, 'Wow, it's all gone,'\" Oberhaus said. \"To me, inflation is the big overriding problem economically.\"\n\nAsked whether it was fair to place the blame entirely on Biden, Oberhaus said: \"They are the administration that's in power.\"\n\nBiden the progressive\n\nAt the outset of his term, Biden told some Democratic colleagues he planned to be the \"most progressive president since FDR,\" the architect of the New Deal.\n\nBiden has spent the last two years on the road touting the trillions of dollars of infrastructure and construction spending that resulted from legislation he signed, much of it passed through Congress on a bipartisan basis. But leading economists have argued the very funding that helped fuel economic growth also caused rising prices -- clouding Biden's ability to sell those achievements to voters.\n\n\"It's important for him to be here to hammer home his economic messages and make it real for people,\" Mandela Barnes, the state's former lieutenant governor, told CNN. \"Some people are still thinking about the $1,500 check they got from Trump.\"\n\nIn CNN's most recent poll, Biden's approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remain starkly negative, as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests.\n\nAs Biden leans into the unfinished business of his 2020 campaign -- and urges voters to let him \"finish the job\" in 2024 -- multiple outside advisers and donors have expressed worry the president is tacking too far to the left. The concern: A platform containing costly proposals like universal preschool, subsidized child and senior care, and expanded health care cater less to moderates than to the party's base.\n\n\"One-eighth of one percent of the population is going to decide this election,\" one longtime Biden donor tells CNN, requesting anonymity to share confidential conversations with the campaign. \"I've told them to move more toward the middle.\"\n\nYet Biden is also still working to shore up his own progressive base, a task complicated by the rising outrage over the administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Americans deserve a President who is looking out for them and they have that in President Biden. Donald Trump on the other hand is proudly running to cut Social Security and Medicare, increase health care costs for everyday Americans, and send jobs overseas,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement to CNN.\n\nWisconsin central to Biden reelection\n\nWednesday was Biden's fourth trip to Wisconsin so far this year, an indication of how central the state is to the President's reelection roadmap. Wisconsin is a pillar of the so-called blue wall with Michigan and Pennsylvania -- all three of which Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped four years later.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by fewer than 21,000 votes. And with a similarly small margin expected to select the 2024 victor, several advisers and former Biden officials have said that striking the right policy tone with moderates this year -- without alienating the party's base -- is paramount.\n\n\"I think that's the No. 1 question,\" a former Biden adviser says of the debate over how progressive to fashion the president's approach. \"Answering that right is the answer of whether Biden wins the election.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign and its acolytes don't see it that way, citing polling that shows the president's agenda has been popular among the party's most loyal voters, as well as independents.\n\n\"He doesn't have to choose between a progressive path and a moderate path,\" said Bharat Ramamurti, Biden's former deputy director of the National Economic Council. \"The agenda he has pursued is the consensus path.\"\n\nPolicy shifts alongside party priorities\n\nAs the Democratic Party's priorities evolve, consensus has taken different forms -- and sometimes required Biden to shift his own positions to the left.\n\nA self-professed capitalist, he pledged during the 2020 campaign not to demonize the rich. Soon after taking office, Biden repeatedly began pushing for policies that tax wealthy individuals and corporations, a shift that emerged from a \"Unity Task Force\" established by the campaign seeking input from progressive economists.\n\nPerhaps no policy is more illustrative of this shift than student loan forgiveness. Biden started out the 2020 campaign supporting only the most limited student loan forgiveness -- such as discharging loans when a borrower declared bankruptcy or died.\n\nBut on the eve of a March 2020 debate with progressive firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was proposing blanket cancellation of student loans, Biden widened his embrace of loan forgiveness. And as president, Biden announced his support for income-based forgiveness that would cancel more than $360 billion in government loans.\n\nWhile that plan was blocked by the Supreme Court, Biden has used regulation and agency authorities to cancel some $146 billion in student debt.\n\n\"It never felt like it was truly something he wanted to do during the campaign,\" said the former Biden adviser. \"And now it's one of his premier economic agenda items.\"\n\nIndividual issues like student loan forgiveness tend to poll well among voters, especially young voters, whose monthly payments are a larger portion of their take-home pay.\n\n\"It's quite striking when you look at the data,\" Ramamurti, the former Biden deputy NEC director and onetime adviser to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, told CNN. The question is whether the votes will follow in November.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

Not a joke.\n\n\"Eighty percent, after we have a major meeting (say) 'You gotta win... my democracy's at stake.'\"\n\nBiden said comments Trump has made on the campaign trail demonstrate how he will bend the presidency to his own ends if he wins back the White House.\n\n\"He's saying... he's gonna make sure his attorney general prosecutes those he tells him to prosecute and if he doesn't, he's going to fire him.\n\n\"He said this about prosecution across the board.

And in his remarks Wednesday, Biden directly blamed Trump for that failure.\n\nTrump, Biden said, \"came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the eighth wonder of the world.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me? Look what happened. They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it,\" the president said.\n\n\"Foxconn turned out to be just that - a con,\" Biden added. \"Go figure.\"\n\nThe sprawling stretch of Racine County, which sits between Chicago and Milwaukee, has been at the center of an intense local political debate over the development through one whipsaw election after another. Residents who live and work nearby told CNN they were happy to see the projects -- and the jobs -- but it was hardly a guarantee that their own economic anxieties would be allayed.\n\n\"Things are really uncertain, not knowing what's going to happen with interest rates and what's going to happen with the whole economy,\" said Dave Flannery, whose family operates the Apple Holler orchard and farm just a few miles from where Biden is set to visit on Wednesday. \"Personally, I'm very optimistic in terms of our future, but at times it's very scary out there.\"\n\nTom Oberhaus, whose family owns Cozy Nook Farm about an hour away near Waukesha, said inflation is one of the biggest criticisms he has about the Biden administration. While he's not a huge admirer of Trump and hoped for a Republican alternative, he said he would gladly return to the economic policies of the Trump era.\n\n\"You get your paycheck and it looks good, but when you pay the bills out, it's like, 'Wow, it's all gone,'\" Oberhaus said. \"To me, inflation is the big overriding problem economically.\"\n\nAsked whether it was fair to place the blame entirely on Biden, Oberhaus said: \"They are the administration that's in power.\"\n\nAt the outset of his term, Biden told some Democratic colleagues he planned to be the \"most progressive president since FDR,\" the architect of the New Deal.\n\nBiden has spent the last two years on the road touting the trillions of dollars of infrastructure and construction spending that resulted from legislation he signed, much of it passed through Congress on a bipartisan basis. But leading economists have argued the very funding that helped fuel economic growth also caused rising prices -- clouding Biden's ability to sell those achievements to voters.\n\n\"It's important for him to be here to hammer home his economic messages and make it real for people,\" Mandela Barnes, the state's former lieutenant governor, told CNN. \"Some people are still thinking about the $1,500 check they got from Trump.\"\n\nIn CNN's most recent poll, Biden's approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remain starkly negative, as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests.\n\nAs Biden leans into the unfinished business of his 2020 campaign -- and urges voters to let him \"finish the job\" in 2024 -- multiple outside advisers and donors have expressed worry the president is tacking too far to the left. The concern: A platform containing costly proposals like universal preschool, subsidized child and senior care, and expanded health care cater less to moderates than to the party's base.\n\n\"One-eighth of one percent of the population is going to decide this election,\" one longtime Biden donor tells CNN, requesting anonymity to share confidential conversations with the campaign. \"I've told them to move more toward the middle.\"\n\nYet Biden is also still working to shore up his own progressive base, a task complicated by the rising outrage over the administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Americans deserve a President who is looking out for them and they have that in President Biden. Donald Trump on the other hand is proudly running to cut Social Security and Medicare, increase health care costs for everyday Americans, and send jobs overseas,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement to CNN.\n\nWednesday was Biden's fourth trip to Wisconsin so far this year, an indication of how central the state is to the President's reelection roadmap. Wisconsin is a pillar of the so-called blue wall with Michigan and Pennsylvania -- all three of which Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped four years later.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by fewer than 21,000 votes. And with a similarly small margin expected to select the 2024 victor, several advisers and former Biden officials have said that striking the right policy tone with moderates this year -- without alienating the party's base -- is paramount.\n\n\"I think that's the No. 1 question,\" a former Biden adviser says of the debate over how progressive to fashion the president's approach. \"Answering that right is the answer of whether Biden wins the election.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign and its acolytes don't see it that way, citing polling that shows the president's agenda has been popular among the party's most loyal voters, as well as independents. The White House points to figures from Navigator - a Democratic-aligned polling firm that bills itself as a \"resource for progressives\" - as informing its views of the agenda's popularity. In April, Navigator polled 1,000 voters on the policies in Biden's State of the Union address and found broad support.\n\n\"He doesn't have to choose between a progressive path and a moderate path,\" said Bharat Ramamurti, Biden's former deputy director of the National Economic Council. \"The agenda he has pursued is the consensus path.\"\n\nAs the Democratic Party's priorities evolve, consensus has taken different forms -- and sometimes required Biden to shift his own positions to the left.\n\nA self-professed capitalist, he pledged during the 2020 campaign not to demonize the rich. Soon after taking office, Biden repeatedly began pushing for policies that tax wealthy individuals and corporations, a shift that emerged from a \"Unity Task Force\" established by the campaign seeking input from progressive economists.\n\nPerhaps no policy is more illustrative of this shift than student loan forgiveness. Biden started out the 2020 campaign supporting only the most limited student loan forgiveness -- such as discharging loans when a borrower declared bankruptcy or died.\n\nBut on the eve of a March 2020 debate with progressive firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was proposing blanket cancellation of student loans, Biden widened his embrace of loan forgiveness. And as president, Biden announced his support for income-based forgiveness that would cancel more than $360 billion in government loans.\n\nWhile that plan was blocked by the Supreme Court, Biden has used regulation and agency authorities to cancel some $146 billion in student debt.\n\n\"It never felt like it was truly something he wanted to do during the campaign,\" said the former Biden adviser. \"And now it's one of his premier economic agenda items.\"\n\nIndividual issues like student loan forgiveness tend to poll well among voters, especially young voters, whose monthly payments are a larger portion of their take-home pay. The White House cites findings from a focus group conducted by Navigator, the firm run by former Democratic campaign officials, as proof that voters want to see more government action on student loans.\n\nBut when considered against a backdrop of other issues, or through the lens of Biden's approval rating, the numbers tell a different story.\n\nA KFF poll earlier this year found that only 32% of registered voters said it was very important for the presidential candidates to talk about student loan debt, well below the 83% who consider inflation a very important issue, 80% who say the same about the affordability of health care and 72% who consider the future of democracy that important.\n\nIn CNN's own polling last month, 24% of respondents called student loans an extremely important issue in making their choice for president, far below the 65% who called the top rated issue, the economy, that important.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling

And in his remarks Wednesday, Biden directly blamed Trump for that failure.\n\nTrump, Biden said, \"came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the eighth wonder of the world.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me? Look what happened. They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it,\" the president said.\n\n\"Foxconn turned out to be just that - a con,\" Biden added. \"Go figure.\"\n\nThe sprawling stretch of Racine County, which sits between Chicago and Milwaukee, has been at the center of an intense local political debate over the development through one whipsaw election after another. Residents who live and work nearby told CNN they were happy to see the projects -- and the jobs -- but it was hardly a guarantee that their own economic anxieties would be allayed.\n\n\"Things are really uncertain, not knowing what's going to happen with interest rates and what's going to happen with the whole economy,\" said Dave Flannery, whose family operates the Apple Holler orchard and farm just a few miles from where Biden is set to visit on Wednesday. \"Personally, I'm very optimistic in terms of our future, but at times it's very scary out there.\"\n\nTom Oberhaus, whose family owns Cozy Nook Farm about an hour away near Waukesha, said inflation is one of the biggest criticisms he has about the Biden administration. While he's not a huge admirer of Trump and hoped for a Republican alternative, he said he would gladly return to the economic policies of the Trump era.\n\n\"You get your paycheck and it looks good, but when you pay the bills out, it's like, 'Wow, it's all gone,'\" Oberhaus said. \"To me, inflation is the big overriding problem economically.\"\n\nAsked whether it was fair to place the blame entirely on Biden, Oberhaus said: \"They are the administration that's in power.\"\n\nBiden the progressive\n\nAt the outset of his term, Biden told some Democratic colleagues he planned to be the \"most progressive president since FDR,\" the architect of the New Deal.\n\nBiden has spent the last two years on the road touting the trillions of dollars of infrastructure and construction spending that resulted from legislation he signed, much of it passed through Congress on a bipartisan basis. But leading economists have argued the very funding that helped fuel economic growth also caused rising prices -- clouding Biden's ability to sell those achievements to voters.\n\n\"It's important for him to be here to hammer home his economic messages and make it real for people,\" Mandela Barnes, the state's former lieutenant governor, told CNN. \"Some people are still thinking about the $1,500 check they got from Trump.\"\n\nIn CNN's most recent poll, Biden's approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remain starkly negative, as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests.\n\nAs Biden leans into the unfinished business of his 2020 campaign -- and urges voters to let him \"finish the job\" in 2024 -- multiple outside advisers and donors have expressed worry the president is tacking too far to the left. The concern: A platform containing costly proposals like universal preschool, subsidized child and senior care, and expanded health care cater less to moderates than to the party's base.\n\n\"One-eighth of one percent of the population is going to decide this election,\" one longtime Biden donor tells CNN, requesting anonymity to share confidential conversations with the campaign. \"I've told them to move more toward the middle.\"\n\nYet Biden is also still working to shore up his own progressive base, a task complicated by the rising outrage over the administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Americans deserve a President who is looking out for them and they have that in President Biden. Donald Trump on the other hand is proudly running to cut Social Security and Medicare, increase health care costs for everyday Americans, and send jobs overseas,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement to CNN.\n\nWisconsin central to Biden reelection\n\nWednesday was Biden's fourth trip to Wisconsin so far this year, an indication of how central the state is to the President's reelection roadmap. Wisconsin is a pillar of the so-called blue wall with Michigan and Pennsylvania -- all three of which Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped four years later.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by fewer than 21,000 votes. And with a similarly small margin expected to select the 2024 victor, several advisers and former Biden officials have said that striking the right policy tone with moderates this year -- without alienating the party's base -- is paramount.\n\n\"I think that's the No. 1 question,\" a former Biden adviser says of the debate over how progressive to fashion the president's approach. \"Answering that right is the answer of whether Biden wins the election.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign and its acolytes don't see it that way, citing polling that shows the president's agenda has been popular among the party's most loyal voters, as well as independents. The White House points to figures from Navigator - a Democratic-aligned polling firm that bills itself as a \"resource for progressives\" - as informing its views of the agenda's popularity. In April, Navigator polled 1,000 voters on the policies in Biden's State of the Union address and found broad support.\n\n\"He doesn't have to choose between a progressive path and a moderate path,\" said Bharat Ramamurti, Biden's former deputy director of the National Economic Council. \"The agenda he has pursued is the consensus path.\"\n\nPolicy shifts alongside party priorities\n\nAs the Democratic Party's priorities evolve, consensus has taken different forms -- and sometimes required Biden to shift his own positions to the left.\n\nA self-professed capitalist, he pledged during the 2020 campaign not to demonize the rich. Soon after taking office, Biden repeatedly began pushing for policies that tax wealthy individuals and corporations, a shift that emerged from a \"Unity Task Force\" established by the campaign seeking input from progressive economists.\n\nPerhaps no policy is more illustrative of this shift than student loan forgiveness. Biden started out the 2020 campaign supporting only the most limited student loan forgiveness -- such as discharging loans when a borrower declared bankruptcy or died.\n\nBut on the eve of a March 2020 debate with progressive firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was proposing blanket cancellation of student loans, Biden widened his embrace of loan forgiveness. And as president, Biden announced his support for income-based forgiveness that would cancel more than $360 billion in government loans.\n\nWhile that plan was blocked by the Supreme Court, Biden has used regulation and agency authorities to cancel some $146 billion in student debt.\n\n\"It never felt like it was truly something he wanted to do during the campaign,\" said the former Biden adviser. \"And now it's one of his premier economic agenda items.\"\n\nIndividual issues like student loan forgiveness tend to poll well among voters, especially young voters, whose monthly payments are a larger portion of their take-home pay. The White House cites findings from a focus group conducted by Navigator, the firm run by former Democratic campaign officials, as proof that voters want to see more government action on student loans.\n\nBut when considered against a backdrop of other issues, or through the lens of Biden's approval rating, the numbers tell a different story.\n\nA KFF poll earlier this year found that only 32% of registered voters said it was very important for the presidential candidates to talk about student loan debt, well below the 83% who consider inflation a very important issue, 80% who say the same about the affordability of health care and 72% who consider the future of democracy that important.\n\nIn CNN's own polling last month, 24% of respondents called student loans an extremely important issue in making their choice for president, far below the 65% who called the top rated issue, the economy, that important.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Tom Oberhaus' last name.\n\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny, MJ Lee, Camilla DeChalus and Michael Williams contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

And with a similarly small margin expected to select the 2024 victor, several advisers and former Biden officials have said that striking the right policy tone with moderates this year -- without alienating the party's base -- is paramount.\n\n\"I think that's the No. 1 question,\" a former Biden adviser says of the debate over how progressive to fashion the president's approach. \"Answering that right is the answer of whether Biden wins the election.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign and its acolytes don't see it that way, citing polling that shows the president's agenda has been popular among the party's most loyal voters, as well as independents.\n\n\"He doesn't have to choose between a progressive path and a moderate path,\" said Bharat Ramamurti, Biden's former deputy director of the National Economic Council. \"The agenda he has pursued is the consensus path.\"\n\nPolicy shifts alongside party priorities\n\nAs the Democratic Party's priorities evolve, consensus has taken different forms -- and sometimes required Biden to shift his own positions to the left.\n\nA self-professed capitalist, he pledged during the 2020 campaign not to demonize the rich. Soon after taking office, Biden repeatedly began pushing for policies that tax wealthy individuals and corporations, a shift that emerged from a \"Unity Task Force\" established by the campaign seeking input from progressive economists.\n\nPerhaps no policy is more illustrative of this shift than student loan forgiveness. Biden started out the 2020 campaign supporting only the most limited student loan forgiveness -- such as discharging loans when a borrower declared bankruptcy or died.\n\nBut on the eve of a March 2020 debate with progressive firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was proposing blanket cancellation of student loans, Biden widened his embrace of loan forgiveness. And as president, Biden announced his support for income-based forgiveness that would cancel more than $360 billion in government loans.\n\nWhile that plan was blocked by the Supreme Court, Biden has used regulation and agency authorities to cancel some $146 billion in student debt.\n\n\"It never felt like it was truly something he wanted to do during the campaign,\" said the former Biden adviser. \"And now it's one of his premier economic agenda items.\"\n\nIndividual issues like student loan forgiveness tend to poll well among voters, especially young voters, whose monthly payments are a larger portion of their take-home pay.\n\n\"It's quite striking when you look at the data,\" Ramamurti, the former Biden deputy NEC director and onetime adviser to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, told CNN. The question is whether the votes will follow in November.\n\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny, MJ Lee and Camilla DeChalus contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kayla_tausche@aol.com", "name": "Kayla Tausche", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waukesha,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waukesha, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waukesha, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racine_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racine County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Racine County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandela_Barnes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mandela Barnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

Voters doubt they're working.", "body": "Of the four laws passed in 2021 or 2022, only Biden's climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, garnered a majority of poll respondents who said they'd heard \"a lot\" or even \"some\" about it. Few voters said the clean energy and infrastructure projects that Biden is championing have had a major impact in their communities or increased jobs.\n\nVoters even give former President Donald Trump almost as much credit as Biden for advancing infrastructure spending -- even though Trump's succession of accomplishment-free \"Infrastructure Weeks\" became a running joke during his administration.\n\nTrailing Trump in the polls for months, Biden has sought to elevate the extensive federal spending on infrastructure, climate change and other projects to bolster his economic record. His campaign has run ads touting these laws in seven battleground states to boost recognition and counter voters' inflation-driven pessimism about the economy.\n\nHis messages aren't landing -- at least not beyond voters who don't already identify as Democrats. Republicans are characteristically averse to crediting Biden, but so are self-identified independents, some of whom are the kinds of swing voters who could determine the result of the November election.\n\nThe POLITICO-Morning Consult poll (toplines, crosstabs) was conducted April 27-28 as part of POLITICO's \"Biden's Billions\" series, which is examining the impact of the president's efforts to use the legislation to revive manufacturing, transform the economy and take on issues such as climate change. The poll surveyed 1,974 registered voters online and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nMajorities of poll respondents said they haven't seen, read or heard anything or much about three of Biden's four major spending laws: The 2021 American Rescue Plan, the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. The poll found greater awareness of the Inflation Reduction Act, but still only 17 percent said they've heard \"a lot\" about it, and 35 percent said they'd heard \"some\" about it.\n\nOf the four, the CHIPS and Science Act has the lowest profile. Only 9 percent of respondents said they'd heard \"a lot\" about it, while another 23 percent said they'd heard \"some.\"\n\nVoters with higher incomes and higher levels of educational attainment tended to be slightly more likely to say they had heard about the laws.\n\n2. There's a clear partisan divide over the laws\n\nThe greatest divide in the survey data falls along party lines. Self-identified Democrats are more likely to say they have seen, read or heard about the laws than Republicans or independents -- and are far more likely to see them as personally beneficial or helping their communities.\n\nFor example, 37 percent of Democratic voters said the Inflation Reduction Act has impacted them positively, compared with only 12 percent of Republicans and 15 percent of independents. And 44 percent of Democrats said the bipartisan infrastructure law has positively impacted their community -- far more than the 15 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of independents who agreed.\n\n3. Voters say they don't see the benefits\n\nThe poll also suggests another problem for Biden: Broadly speaking, few voters say they're seeing the federal government's efforts to revitalize the nation's infrastructure or build up a clean energy sector.\n\nOnly a quarter of voters, 25 percent, said \"the clean energy and infrastructure projects approved since 2021\" had increased jobs in their community. Thirty percent said they've had no impact, and another 28 percent didn't know or had no opinion.\n\nFor the four specific laws tested -- even when restricted to poll respondents who said they'd heard something about them -- only around 25 percent said they had positively impacted them personally.\n\nAsked about the combined impact of federal spending on infrastructure in their community since Biden became president, 26 percent said it had a \"major impact,\" another 26 percent said it had a \"minor impact\" and 30 percent said it had \"no impact.\" Eighteen percent of respondents had no opinion.\n\nBiden can keep trying to champion infrastructure during the course of the campaign, but voters aren't praising it right now.\n\n4. Many voters credit Trump, not Biden, for doing more on infrastructure\n\nMany voters aren't giving Biden credit when they do see positive benefits.\n\nWhen he signed the infrastructure bill into law in 2021, Biden famously succeeded where Trump had failed. But asked who has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and job creation, nearly as many voters said Trump (37 percent) as Biden (40 percent). Twelve percent said they've both done about the same, and another 12 percent had no opinion.\n\nUnsurprisingly, party identification is the key driver on this question. About three-in-four Democrats, 74 percent, said Biden has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and jobs -- but an almost identical number of Republicans, 70 percent, said it's Trump who's done more. Among independents, roughly the same number picked Biden (34 percent) and Trump (32 percent).\n\nBiden also has a slight edge among voters in the presidential battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- leading Trump on the question of who gets more credit, 42 percent to 36 percent.\n\nThe Biden campaign's most-aired TV ad seeks to make this point specifically: \"For four years, Donald Trump tried to pass an infrastructure law -- and he failed,\" Biden says in the spot, which has been backed by $4.6 million in spending, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political advertising. \"I got it done. Now we're rebuilding America.\"\n\nBut on virtually every question about the spending bills -- including whether Biden or Trump gets more credit -- the poll numbers among respondents in electoral swing states did not meaningfully differ from the overall results. Some voters give him credit for the benefits they see -- but nearly as many voters credit Trump instead.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [],

The poll's margin of error is +/-2.8 percentage points.\n\nOur main question was to ask registered voters about a straight, head-to-head matchup between Biden and Trump. More specifically, voters were asked to choose among Biden, Trump, \"not sure\" \"other\" and \"prefer not to answer\" as possible responses.\n\nIn this matchup, Biden comes out ahead 42% to Trump 40%, but remember the margin of error is greater than that, so statistically it remains a tossup. Among other answers, 10% chose \"other\" over either of the main candidates, while 7% said the weren't sure.\n\nBiden's strength is based on solid 86% support from his base Democratic Party backers, while Trump sees identical support from among Republicans. But Democrats generally see slightly higher turnout than Republicans, so Biden gets the edge.\n\nA second comparison includes Biden, Trump and the three main third-party or independent candidates, including independent lawyer-activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., university professor and activist Cornel West, and Green Party standard-bearer Jill Stein.\n\nAs expected, adding the others into the mix alters the results somewhat. Biden takes 39% of the vote, while Trump takes 38% of the vote, a virtual dead-heat given the margin of error.\n\nBut Kennedy gets 12% of the overall vote, taking from both Biden and Trump. West and Stein, with 1% each, have little if any impact. Kennedy attracts 9% of Democrats and 7% of Republicans, but an even-larger 18% slice of the independents.\n\nAs noted, while the overall appears close, there are some mitigating factors.\n\nStart with this: At over 40% of the potential total vote, those who declare themselves \"Independents\" are the swing vote in close elections. This could spell trouble for Biden, more than Trump.\n\nIn the head-to-head poll, Trump wins 35% of independents' support, compared to just 30% for Biden and 21% for \"other.\"\n\nBut add in the third-party candidates, and Trump beats Biden 33% to 25%, with 18% (as mentioned above) picking RFK Jr. as their favorite.\n\nWhy is this important? Independents in the last election favored Biden 54% to Trump's 41%. That has, for all intents and purposes been reversed this time around, as the I&I/TIPP data demonstrate.\n\nTrump has also made significant inroads among key traditional Democratic constituencies.\n\nAfrican-Americans, for instance, gave 87% of their vote to Biden in 2020, compared to just 12% for Trump. But that's changed dramatically in 2024: Black voters say they favor Biden by 59%, a 28% decline from four years ago, while 15% say they back Trump, a three percentage-point gain. All told, it's a 31-point swing.\n\nAmong Hispanics, Biden slammed Trump in 2020, 65% to 32%. In this month's I&I/TIPP Poll, Hispanics give just 47% support to Biden, 26% to Trump, and 13% to Kennedy.\n\nThis month, the I&I/TIPP Poll also asked a number of questions that attempt to gain a better idea of how people see this election turning out.\n\nIn one of those questions, we asked partisans of Trump, Biden and Kennedy, \"Do you support (candidate's name) strongly or moderately?\"\n\nAgain, the answers are revealing for the depth of support each has. For Biden, 54% said they support him \"strongly,\" while 43% backed him \"moderately.\"\n\nFor Trump? Of those responding, 64% described their Trump support as strong, but just 34% termed it moderate.\n\nKennedy did worse. Just 38% of his backers called their support strong, as 53% said it was moderate.\n\nSo Trump appears to have stronger intensity of his base support than either of his two rivals. That, possibly, could give Trump a solid edge in last-minute \"get-out-the-vote\" efforts in the closing weeks of the campaign.\n\nFurther digging, the poll asked all respondents who they expected to win in November.\n\nThe answer: 37% predicted Trump, 34% Biden. Another 15% described the election as \"too close to call,\" while 12% said they \"don't know enough to answer one way or the other.\"\n\nAnother question, intended to help discover how people really feel about the candidates, is to ask them \"if the election were held today, who do you believe most of your neighbors would vote for?\"\n\nThe answer is revealing: 43% responded Trump, while just 31% said Biden. Another 25% said \"not sure.\"\n\nWhat does it all mean? That Biden and third-party candidates appear to have an \"enthusiasm gap\" with Trump.\n\nIn an election marred by charges of \"lawfare\" against former President Trump, with a majority saying he can't get a fair trial, the sudden emergence of the \"Gaza problem\" after what many believe has been Biden's diplomatic ineptitude and lack of support for Israel, a growing third-party insurgency by RFK Jr., and the possible defection of key Democratic voting blocs, including minorities, organized labor, working-class voters, and even Catholics, Biden and the Democrats cannot rest easy.\n\nI&I/TIPP data indicate that even voters who support Biden show a lack of enthusiasm, while most registered voters now expect Trump to win, significant since recent studies indicate such expectations have a high likelihood of becoming reality.\n\n\"55% of the public now considers the Trump presidency a success, and 44% look at it as a failure,\" wrote Rich Lowry in the New York Post. \"Biden, in contrast, is upside down. Only 39% say his presidency has been a success, while 61% say it's been a failure.\"\n\n\"With about six months remaining before Election Day, Biden stands in a weaker position than any prior incumbent,\" the recent Gallup Poll noted. No doubt, those leading Biden's re-election bid have noted the same thing.\n\nI&I/TIPP publishes timely, unique, and informative data each month on topics of public interest.

Rasmussen's latest has Trump ahead of Biden by ten points:\n\nDespite being on trial in New York City, former President Donald Trump has widened his lead over President Joe Biden during the past month.\n\nThe latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that, in a three-way contest between Biden, Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 46% of Likely U.S. Voters would choose Trump, 36% would vote for Biden and nine percent (9%) would vote for Kennedy.\n\nAnother 4% say they would vote for someone else, and 4% are undecided. Those numbers can't give Biden much comfort. The \"someone elses\" in the race are leftists who no doubt will draw some votes, and I don't think 4% is a high number for undecideds at this stage. Nor are RFK's numbers high enough to give a lot of hope. If we assume that half of Kennedy's voters will fall away between now and the election, a reasonable guess, I think, that leaves 4-5% to flop one way or the other. Biden's problem is that they won't all come his way. On the contrary, a good number of voters are interested in Kennedy because they are disgusted with Biden. So I doubt that Biden will net more than a point or two as Kennedy falls back.\n\nIf we assume that most voters who are undecided on the eve of an election vote against the incumbent, as pollsters tell us, the picture gets even bleaker.\n\nOf course, events between now and November will play a major role.

Arizona looks out of reach, as does Georgia. North Carolina could be a blowout, and even Nevada looks out of reach. That leaves Wisconsin and Michigan as competitive.\n\nTrump's lead in the polling averages of battleground states, including Pennsylvania, presents a formidable challenge for Biden. Despite Pennsylvania being a state where Biden is expected to perform well, the current data suggests a tough road ahead for him.\n\nThe new AARP poll shows decisive movement in Trump's direction since the end of April, although comparing polls from different companies is a dicey proposition. The latest poll before this one ended April 29th, showing Trump up 2. In the head-to-head in AARP's poll, Trump is up by four, which suggests that the state is moving out of reach for Biden. In a 4-way, Trump is up 5. Those aren't small numbers in states that are battlegrounds.\n\nInsert all the normal caveats: it's early, one poll doesn't mean much, etc. etc. You know the drill.\n\nExcept if you look at the timing of the polls, a clear trend emerges. Trump does better each week. That likely means there is a trend. It's not proof of one, but it sure looks like one.\n\nThe internals of the poll are brutal for Biden. Trump's personal and job-related approval ratings are significantly higher than Biden's, suggesting that many people have not just rejected Biden but reassessed their opinion of Trump, who has net positive numbers regarding his job performance. This means that many people who don't like him think highly of him as the Chief Executive.\n\nTrump's 51% approval vs Biden's 36% is just devastating for Biden, as is his -23% net approval as a person. He is not kindly Uncle Joe in people's eyes, but the man who is ruining the country. Biden's net favorable with DEMOCRATS is only +40 while Trump's with Republicans is net +70.\n\nWith Independents, Biden is dramatically behind Trump both in image and in job approval. Trump's image with Independents is still net negative, but still 13 points higher than Biden's. When asked about job approval, Trump is in positive territory, while Biden is 37 points behind Trump.\n\n37 points. Yowza. Independents really don't think Biden is doing a good job.\n\nWhen you drill down to voters 50+--AARP's constituency after all--you can see why Biden isn't doing so well. Look at the issues they care about.\n\nOf the top 3 issues, only one favors Biden--abortion--with immigration and inflation being the top two. Immigration is way ahead of the pack, which doesn't bode well for Sleepy Joe.\n\nThe big divides are mostly what you would expect. College-educated voters like Biden, non college voters like Trump. Rural voters hate Biden, urban voters Trump. Biden still polls well with Black voters in Pennsylvania, although the margin may be a bit weak for him.\n\nOne thing that might surprise is that younger voters hate Biden much more than they do Trump, although the category is 18-49 (AARP, remember!), so it's unclear how that cohort would break down if you divided this group into smaller groups.\n\nPersuadable voters--people who don't vote straight ticket--are not as passionate about immigration, but still put it as one of their top 2 issues along with inflation. It's just that inflation tops immigration as the #1 issue. If this election is fought on this territory--inflation and immigration--Trump wins.\n\nIn short, this poll is a disaster for Biden. If nothing else it tells us that Biden will have to spend a lot of time and money in Pennsylvania because he has a ton of ground to make up in an environment that is distinctly unfavorable.\n\nExpect the volume of Trump hate to be turned up to 11, and expect that to matter not in the least. Biden is putting most of his eggs in the \"prosecute Trump\" basket, and even there things look, if not bleak, not that good for him. Politically, at least, Biden is losing on that front too.\n\nMeaning they need a conviction for it to help, and it may not even then. I suspect that most persuadables know that these are political prosecutions.\n\nDoes this mean Trump will win? Of course not.

In an interview with CNN that was conducted in the battleground state of Wisconsin, Biden also explained why he thinks the polls are wrong and warned Israel he would withhold U.S. weapons if it invades Rafah.\n\nHe also conceded he is watching the coverage of Trump's hush money trial in New York - which included shocking testimony from adult star Stormy Daniels - and even had kind words for his Republican rival who remains stuck in a New York court room. It was a rare sitdown interview for the president with a major news outlet. He has mostly spoken to friendlier outlets - like the 'Smartless' podcast and radio host Howard Stern.\n\nBiden sounded hoarse in the 30 minute interview, which aired Wednesday night but didn't hold back when it came to sounding off against his Republican rival even has he said he prays for Trump. 'God love him,' he said when asked about Trump's hush-money trial in New York. And added he's tracking it 'only on the evening news.' He also predicted, like in their 2020 contest, that Trump won't accept the results of the November election. 'I promise you he won't,' he told CNN's Erin Burnett. 'He won't, which is dangerous.'\n\nHe also revealed what Obama advised him when it came to his rematch with Trump. 'Keep doing what you're doing,' he said. Trump has repeatedly - and falsely - claimed to be the victim of voter fraud and the true winner of the 2020 election. Multiple recounts and investigations have shown Biden was the victor. The former president faces state charges in Georgia on charges he and his allies tried to overturn Biden's victory there. But a Georgia appeals court on Wednesday delayed Trump's criminal case in that state, agreeing to hear an appeal from the former president that may foreclose a trial taking place this year.\n\nTrump faces four counts on the federal level tied to the January 6th insurrection on Capitol Hill. But the case is on hold awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether or not Trump, as president at the time, has immunity. Biden, who was in Wisconsin to tout his record on the economy and to announce an investment by Microsoft to build a factory, defended his handling of inflation. Polls show voters are nervous about the critical and critical of Biden's handling of the economy.\n\nBut Biden, in his interview with CNN, claimed the polls are wrong. 'We've already turned it around,' Biden said in response to a question on whether, less than six months before Election Day, he was running short on time to improve voters view of him. In a recent CNN poll, Biden's approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) were in the negative zone. And voters cite the economy as their concern when picking a president. 'The polling data has been wrong all along,' Biden said of the numbers, questioning the effectiveness of phone surveys. 'I think I'm feeling good about the trajectory of the campaign. And, and you know, as far as I do, most people don't really focus and make up their mind till the fall. There's a lot going on,' he noted.\n\nBiden's re-election team has touted their massive fundraising numbers and on-the-ground operation in battleground states. They also point out Trump is required to be in New York for the trial. 'By the end of this month, we will have at least 200 offices and 500 staff,' said Dan Kanninen, director of battleground states for the campaign, in a briefing with reporters on Tuesday. 'The Trump campaign has virtually no presence in most of the battleground states. If they decide to do any organizing work at all, they will almost certainly be forced to rely on expensive and last-minute tactics with folks who have never set foot in a community in which they're knocking doors.'\n\nNational polls show a statistical tie between Biden and Trump. But, in several polls of key battleground states, the former president leads. With six months to go, anything can happen and a lot of factors remain in play. Biden, as of late, has shifted tactics on Trump. He's taken to mocking his Republican rival throwing out zingers that call into question everything from the former president's energy levels to his hair. At the White House Correspondents Dinner last month, Biden even mocked Trump's hush money trial in New York noting his rival is facing 'stormy days' - a reference to adult star Stormy Daniels. And, at fundraisers lately, Biden has been talking about a 'defeated-looking' man who had complained to him about a 'crushing debt.' 'And I had to look at him and say, 'Donald, I'm sorry. I can't help you,' Biden said.\n\nThe donors in the audience typically burst into applause and cheers. Trump is facing multiple trials on the state and federal level: including a hush-money case in New York, a federal case over his handling of classified documents, and both federal and state charges he tried to overturn the 2020 election results. He's gotten a few breaks however and it's looking more-and-more likely he won't face any more courtroom time - once the hush-money trial is finished - until after the election. Biden, meanwhile, is dealing with an unstable Middle East and progressives who are unhappy with his staunch support of Israel and the treatment of Palestinian refugees.\n\nThen there is Robert Kennedy Jr.'s independent presidential bid. Both Trump and Biden's teams are worried Kennedy could play a spoiler role, taking voters away from each of them. Trump has ramped up his criticism of RFK Jr., and Biden rolled out a dozen endorsements from the Kennedy family to counter RFK Jr.'s use of the clan's political legacy. Biden's health remains an issue. The president will turn 82 just weeks after Election Day, Nov. 5, and is already the oldest president in U.S. history; Trump is 77. And his approval rating remains at a low 38 percent, per Gallup polling.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

They're less like maps and more like compasses. They can indicate wide trends and give a sense of bearing.\n\nWith that (and margin of error) in mind, here's what we're watching.\n\nSuburbanites\n\nLet's start with a demographic that helped block Hillary Clinton from the White House, but helped Biden win it: suburbanites.\n\nBiden won 54 percent of voters in the 'burbs in 2020, flipping the group for Democrats from Clinton's 45 percent.\n\nNow in 2024, there are signs that support from suburban adults is on pause.\n\nIn the single month between our March and April polls, Biden saw both his approval rating and favorability ratings among this group drop to less than 50 percent.\n\nA closer look at favorability shows that 52 percent of suburban adults had a favorable impression of Biden in late March. Weeks later, it was just 43 percent. Even considering margins of error, that's a fast drop.\n\nThe margin of error is a range that shows us how close those estimates represent reality, serving as a \"guidepost\" to help us interpret data and attitudes. Lee Miringoff, who directs the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, discusses these statistical concepts to better the nuance in polling data. Video by PBS NewsHour\n\nBiden is fortunate in that the figures for how people will likely vote if the election were today did not slide by nearly as much. But they did slip. In March, given the choice between Biden, Trump, and independent and green party candidates, 50 percent of suburban registered voters chose Biden. In April, it was 47 percent.\n\nThat is not enough to be statistically significant. And Biden still is ahead of Donald Trump with suburban voters when they're asked who they'd support if the election were today. But it is symbolically significant, inching toward that doomed 45 percent mark that Clinton saw in 2016.\n\nWomen\n\nWhile smaller demographics can have outsized influence, the larger the voting block the more impactful their swings.\n\nThis brings us to women, who make up slightly more than 50 percent of the population, per the U.S. Census Bureau. Women have also voted in slightly higher percentages than men in every presidential election since 1980, per the Center for American Women and Politics.\n\nSimply put, they are one of the largest and most powerful voting groups in the country. And Biden won 55 percent of women voters in 2020.\n\nEducate your inbox\n\nSubscribe to Here's the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nEmail Address Subscribe Form error message goes here.\n\nThank you.

Or at least sitting in the stands.\n\nBut the percentage of Democratic women who say they \"strongly approve\" of how Biden is doing dropped, from 52 percent in March to 43 percent in April. Of course, Biden is generally popular with this group, but we want to point out an apparent loss of enthusiasm from a group Biden needs to be fervent.\n\nVoters of color\n\nAnother core group for Biden in 2020: non-white voters.\n\nThe Pew Research Center estimated that Black, Hispanic and Asian voters and those of other races accounted for about four-in-10 of Biden's votes in 2020.\n\nBut Pew noted a potential weakness for Biden, writing, \"Even as Biden held on to a majority of Hispanic voters in 2020, Trump made gains among this group overall.\"\n\nLet's look at how these voters are feeling in our polls.\n\nOn favorability, Biden was winning with non-white voters in March. Fifty percent indicated they had a favorable impression of him. By April, that figure had dipped to 45 percent.\n\nThat said, 66 percent of people in this group who support Biden said that they are backing the president because they support him, rather than because they oppose Trump.\n\nAnd they are still planning to vote for him. In our April poll, when asked who among the major party and independent candidates they would support, 47 percent of non-white voters said they are backing Biden, with 34 percent ready to vote for Trump. Eleven percent said they'd vote for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Four percent were undecided and 2 percent would vote for Jill Stein and Cornel West each.\n\nWhite voters\n\nOne more group we want to look at: white voters. This is not a core constituency for Biden. Democrats routinely lose with white voters overall. But the margin for Biden could make or break him.\n\nIn our April poll, when asked if the election were today 48 percent of white voters said they'd support Trump, compared to 38 percent who backed Biden. Eleven percent said they'd vote for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. To keep the White House, Biden must either raise his numbers with whites overall to be higher than that or he must raise his numbers with non-white voters. (Or there must be a shift in turnout that favors him.)\n\nWe spoke with Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher about this last week. He pointed out that Barack Obama won his 2012 race for president overall with 39 percent of white voters backing him. And Biden won in 2020 with 41 percent of white voters.\n\nThat is the neighborhood Biden wants to be in by November.\n\n\"If Biden is coming anywhere close to 43 percent of white voters, the math doesn't work for Trump,\" Belcher said.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_desjardins@pbs.org", "name": "Lisa Desjardins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_NewsHour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PBS NewsHour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marist College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_Poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marist Poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Census Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

And in his remarks Wednesday, Biden plans to directly point his finger at Trump for that failure, according to a White House official.\n\nThe sprawling stretch of Racine County, which sits between Chicago and Milwaukee, has been at the center of an intense local political debate over the development through one whipsaw election after another. Residents who live and work nearby told CNN they were happy to see the projects -- and the jobs -- but it was hardly a guarantee that their own economic anxieties would be allayed.\n\n\"Things are really uncertain, not knowing what's going to happen with interest rates and what's going to happen with the whole economy,\" said Dave Flannery, whose family operates the Apple Holler orchard and farm just a few miles from where Biden is set to visit on Wednesday. \"Personally, I'm very optimistic in terms of our future, but at times it's very scary out there.\"\n\nTom Osterhaus, whose family owns Cozy Nook Farm about an hour away near Waukesha, said inflation is one of the biggest criticisms he has about the Biden administration. While he's not a huge admirer of Trump and hoped for a Republican alternative, he said he would gladly return to the economic policies of the Trump era.\n\n\"You get your paycheck and it looks good, but when you pay the bills out, it's like, 'Wow, it's all gone,'\" Osterhaus said. \"To me, inflation is the big overriding problem economically.\"\n\nAsked whether it was fair to place the blame entirely on Biden, Osterhaus said: \"They are the administration that's in power.\"\n\nBiden the progressive\n\nAt the outset of his term, Biden told some Democratic colleagues he planned to be the \"most progressive president since FDR,\" the architect of the New Deal.\n\nBiden has spent the last two years on the road touting the trillions of dollars of infrastructure and construction spending that resulted from legislation he signed, much of it passed through Congress on a bipartisan basis. But leading economists have argued the very funding that helped fuel economic growth also caused rising prices -- clouding Biden's ability to sell those achievements to voters.\n\n\"It's important for him to be here to hammer home his economic messages and make it real for people,\" Mandela Barnes, the state's former lieutenant governor, told CNN. \"Some people are still thinking about the $1,500 check they got from Trump.\"\n\nIn CNN's most recent poll, Biden's approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remain starkly negative, as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests.\n\nAs Biden leans into the unfinished business of his 2020 campaign -- and urges voters to let him \"finish the job\" in 2024 -- multiple outside advisers and donors have expressed worry the president is tacking too far to the left. The concern: A platform containing costly proposals like universal preschool, subsidized child and senior care, and expanded health care cater less to moderates than to the party's base.\n\n\"One-eighth of one percent of the population is going to decide this election,\" one longtime Biden donor tells CNN, requesting anonymity to share confidential conversations with the campaign. \"I've told them to move more toward the middle.\"\n\nYet Biden is also still working to shore up his own progressive base, a task complicated by the rising outrage over the administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nWisconsin central to Biden reelection\n\nDuring a previous trip to Wisconsin, President Joe Biden speaks about student loan debt relief at Madison Area Technical College in Madison, Wisconsin, April 8, 2024. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWednesday will be Biden's fourth trip to Wisconsin so far this year, an indication of how central the state is to the President's reelection roadmap. Wisconsin is a pillar of the so-called blue wall with Michigan and Pennsylvania -- all three of which Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped four years later.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by fewer than 21,000 votes. And with a similarly small margin expected to select the 2024 victor, several advisers and former Biden officials have said that striking the right policy tone with moderates this year -- without alienating the party's base -- is paramount.\n\n\"I think that's the No. 1 question,\" a former Biden adviser says of the debate over how progressive to fashion the president's approach. \"Answering that right is the answer of whether Biden wins the election.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign and its acolytes don't see it that way, citing polling that shows the president's agenda has been popular among the party's most loyal voters, as well as independents.\n\n\"He doesn't have to choose between a progressive path and a moderate path,\" said Bharat Ramamurti, Biden's former deputy director of the National Economic Council. \"The agenda he has pursued is the consensus path.\"\n\nPolicy shifts alongside party priorities\n\nAs the Democratic Party's priorities evolve, consensus has taken different forms -- and sometimes required Biden to shift his own positions to the left.\n\nA self-professed capitalist, he pledged during the 2020 campaign not to demonize the rich. Soon after taking office, Biden repeatedly began pushing for policies that tax wealthy individuals and corporations, a shift that emerged from a \"Unity Task Force\" established by the campaign seeking input from progressive economists.\n\nPerhaps no policy is more illustrative of this shift than student loan forgiveness. Biden started out the 2020 campaign supporting only the most limited student loan forgiveness -- such as discharging loans when a borrower declared bankruptcy or died.\n\nBut on the eve of a March 2020 debate with progressive firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was proposing blanket cancellation of student loans, Biden widened his embrace of loan forgiveness. And as president, Biden announced his support for income-based forgiveness that would cancel more than $360 billion in government loans.\n\nWhile that plan was blocked by the Supreme Court, Biden has used regulation and agency authorities to cancel some $146 billion in student debt.\n\n\"It never felt like it was truly something he wanted to do during the campaign,\" said the former Biden adviser. \"And now it's one of his premier economic agenda items.\"\n\nIndividual issues like student loan forgiveness tend to poll well among voters, especially young voters, whose monthly payments are a larger portion of their take-home pay.\n\n\"It's quite striking when you look at the data,\" Ramamurti, the former Biden deputy NEC director and onetime adviser to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, told CNN. The question is whether the votes will follow in November.\n\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny, MJ Lee and Camilla DeChalus contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kayla_tausche@cnn.com", "name": "Kayla Tausche", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waukesha,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waukesha, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waukesha, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racine_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racine County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Racine County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandela_Barnes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mandela Barnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

He has mostly spoken to friendlier outlets - like the 'Smartless' podcast and radio host Howard Stern.\n\nPresident Biden sat down for an interview with CNN, a rare interview with a major news outlet\n\nBiden sounded hoarse in the 30 minute interview, which aired Wednesday night but didn't hold back when it came to sounding off against his Republican rival even has he said he prays for Trump.\n\n'God love him,' he said when asked about Trump's hush-money trial in New York.\n\nAnd added he's tracking it 'only on the evening news.'\n\nHe also predicted, like in their 2020 contest, that Trump won't accept the results of the November election.\n\n'I promise you he won't,' he told CNN's Erin Burnett. 'He won't, which is dangerous.'\n\nHe also revealed what Obama advised him when it came to his rematch with Trump.\n\n'Keep doing what you're doing,' he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly - and falsely - claimed to be the victim of voter fraud and the true winner of the 2020 election. Multiple recounts and investigations have shown Biden was the victor.\n\nThe former president faces state charges in Georgia on charges he and his allies tried to overturn Biden's victory there.\n\nBut a Georgia appeals court on Wednesday delayed Trump's criminal case in that state, agreeing to hear an appeal from the former president that may foreclose a trial taking place this year.\n\nTrump faces four counts on the federal level tied to the January 6th insurrection on Capitol Hill. But the case is on hold awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether or not Trump, as president at the time, has immunity.\n\n'God love him,' Biden said of Donald Trump (above), who is in New York on trial\n\nIn this courtroom sketch, defense attorney Susan Necheles, center, cross examines Stormy Daniels, far right, as former President Donald Trump, left, looks on\n\nBiden, who was in Wisconsin to tout his record on the economy and to announce an investment by Microsoft to build a factory, defended his handling of inflation.\n\nPolls show voters are nervous about the critical and critical of Biden's handling of the economy.\n\nBut Biden, in his interview with CNN, claimed the polls are wrong.\n\n'We've already turned it around,' Biden said in response to a question on whether, less than six months before Election Day, he was running short on time to improve voters view of him.\n\nIn a recent CNN poll, Biden's approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) were in the negative zone. And voters cite the economy as their concern when picking a president.\n\n'The polling data has been wrong all along,' Biden said of the numbers, questioning the effectiveness of phone surveys.\n\n'I think I'm feeling good about the trajectory of the campaign. And, and you know, as far as I do, most people don't really focus and make up their mind till the fall. There's a lot going on,' he noted.\n\nBiden's re-election team has touted their massive fundraising numbers and on-the-ground operation in battleground states. They also point out Trump is required to be in New York for the trial.\n\n'By the end of this month, we will have at least 200 offices and 500 staff,' said Dan Kanninen, director of battleground states for the campaign, in a briefing with reporters on Tuesday.\n\n'The Trump campaign has virtually no presence in most of the battleground states. If they decide to do any organizing work at all, they will almost certainly be forced to rely on expensive and last-minute tactics with folks who have never set foot in a community in which they're knocking doors.'\n\nNational polls show a statistical tie between Biden and Trump. But, in several polls of key battleground states, the former president leads.\n\nWith six months to go, anything can happen and a lot of factors remain in play.\n\nBiden, as of late, has shifted tactics on Trump. He's taken to mocking his Republican rival throwing out zingers that call into question everything from the former president's energy levels to his hair.\n\nAt the White House Correspondents Dinner last month, Biden even mocked Trump's hush money trial in New York noting his rival is facing 'stormy days' - a reference to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nAnd, at fundraisers lately, Biden has been talking about a 'defeated-looking' man who had complained to him about a 'crushing debt.'\n\n'And I had to look at him and say, 'Donald, I'm sorry. I can't help you,' Biden said.\n\nThe donors in the audience typically burst into applause and cheers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden revealed the advice Obama has given him\n\nPresident Joe Biden meets with campaign volunteers at the Dr. John Bryant Community Center in Racine, Wis.\n\nTrump is facing multiple trials on the state and federal level: including a hush-money case in New York, a federal case over his handling of classified documents, and both federal and state charges he tried to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nHe's gotten a few breaks however and it's looking more-and-more likely he won't face any more courtroom time - once the hush-money trial is finished - until after the election.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is dealing with an unstable Middle East and progressives who are unhappy with his staunch support of Israel and the treatment of Palestinian refugees.\n\nThen there is Robert Kennedy Jr.'s independent presidential bid. Both Trump and Biden's teams are worried Kennedy could play a spoiler role, taking voters away from each of them.\n\nTrump has ramped up his criticism of RFK Jr., and Biden rolled out a dozen endorsements from the Kennedy family to counter RFK Jr.'s use of the clan's political legacy.\n\nBiden's health remains an issue. The president will turn 82 just weeks after Election Day, Nov. 5, and is already the oldest president in U.S. history; Trump is 77.\n\nAnd his approval rating remains at a low 38 percent, per Gallup polling.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc",

The staggering truth: Trump leading Biden by ....  - The...", "body": "In an election year when the Left has sounded the alarm about \"misinformation and disinformation,\" the biggest falsehood may be about this election itself -- and it's coming from the legacy media.\n\nEvery corner of the media insists the 2024 presidential election will be razor-thin.\n\nSponsored: Man Cancels Knee Surgery After His Doctor Finds This\n\n\"An expensive, personal, very close presidential race careens toward an uncertain end,\" says NBC News.\n\n\"Biden, Trump in close race with 6 months until presidential election,\" reports CBS News.\n\nAmerica could be looking at a Ronald Reagan-style landslide, with President Donald Trump piling up as many as 49 states, according to the new poll.\n\nIf the election were held today, Donald Trump would trounce Joe Biden by an incredible 10 points, burying Biden's blue assault in huge red tidal wave.\n\nSponsored: Could Biden Order Americans to Turn in Their Cash?\n\nTrump would win 46 percent of voters to Biden's 36 percent, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. winning nine points, according to the survey from Rasmussen Reports.\n\nSeeing Trump's 10-point lead, the Left is freaking out -- and rightly so.\n\n\"Polls are not predictions, to be sure, but to place this data into an appropriate context, the last time a presidential candidate won the national popular vote by ten points was 30 years ago, when Ronald Reagan won 49 states,\" reports New York Magazine (accurately, for once).\n\nTrump supporters are nine points more likely to say they're \"very excited\" about the election than Biden voters. Registered Republicans have a 15-point lead in excitement.\n\nTrump wins by keeping his votes and attracting independents. Eight out of 10 Republicans say they'll vote for Trump, compared to seven out of 10 Democrats backing the incumbent.\n\n\"Among unaffiliated voters, Trump is backed by 44%, Biden by 26%, and 15% would choose RFK Jr.,\" reported Newsmax.\n\nBut when it comes to Biden's campaign, Rasmussen only has bad news and worse news.\n\nThe bad news is: Biden would lose a three-way race. The worse news is: Biden isn't in three-way race.\n\nThat makes sense, since all three of the major third-party candidates are on the progressive Left, as The Horn detailed almost six months ago.\n\nDonald Trump faces third-party challenges from the Right, as well -- but they don't threaten him.\n\nIn fact, the Libertarian Party invited Trump to headline their convention.\n\nSmart campaign strategists would try to improve Biden's campaign -- and maybe even his presidency -- to gain support from American voters...but the Left is too ideologically driven to do that. Instead, the Democrats doubled-down on shoving Biden down America's throat, denying the facts, and getting their friends in the legacy media to shoot the messenger.\n\n\"Everything we know about contemporary politics indicates the 2024 election will be close,\" says New York Magazine, despite polls showing Trump leading in nearly every swing state.\n\nPeople who say Biden will lose are just \"leaping on individual polls or even short-term trends in averages,\" and they're engaging in \"spin rather than analysis,\" claims the article...but then the author engages in a little spin of his own.\n\n\"Overall, it's reasonably clear that the Biden-Trump race remains very close in terms of the national popular vote,\" writes Ed Kilgore.\n\nComing Soon: Disturbing \"Spyware\" US Dollar [sponsored]\n\nThat may be true -- but it's also a red herring: Presidents are not elected by the national popular vote. The Constitution demands that candidates win the majority of votes in the Electoral College, which means winning the right combination of large and small states to represent all the American people.\n\nSince Democrats mostly represent secular, heavily urbanized states with large illegal immigrant populations -- and high crime rates -- they've promoted a scheme to replace the Electoral College with a \"National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.\" The Horn described this attempt to sabotage the American system, and maximizing the liberals' chances of winning future elections, here.\n\nKilgore eventually admits that he sees \"Trump maintaining a small advantage in winning enough battleground states to secure the 270 electoral votes necessary for victory.\" But if you're denying the trends and flogging irrelevant facts about the \"national popular vote,\" who's engaging in spin?\n\nThings look so bad for Biden that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called on the president to drop out of the race and let RFK Jr. represent the progressive movement.\n\nAt a campaign event on May 1, RFK Jr. rolled out a poll from John Zogby showing Kennedy would defeat Donald Trump in a head-to-head election this November.\n\n\"Is there any scenario in which President Trump participates in the election and doesn't win it? Yes, there is exactly one. And that scenario is that President Biden acknowledges that he cannot win,\" said RFK Jr.'s wife and campaign manager, Amaryllis Fox Kennedy.\n\nWith the stock already up 63% in 2024 alone - is it too late to get in? One legendary stock picker\u202fjust gave his answer [sponsored]\n\nA Democratic aide replied that calling on Biden to leave the race is \"deeply unserious\" -- not to mention extremely bad for his paycheck.\n\nIt may end up being a close election, and everyone should vote -- and make sure their neighbors vote -- as if it is.

Trump was a threat to democracy and should be prosecuted, according to two people familiar with his comments,\" The Times report began.\n\n\"And while the president has never communicated his frustrations directly to Mr. Garland, he has said privately that he wanted Mr. Garland to act less like a ponderous judge and more like a prosecutor who is willing to take decisive action over the events of Jan. 6,\" The Times report added.\n\nOf course, a major leak to The New York Times about the President being unhappy the Attorney General isn't moving quickly enough is the functional equivalent of a direct order to indict Trump.\n\nAfter Donald Trump successfully delayed the January 6 trial Jack Smith sought in Washington, D.C., Biden again complained to the media about Garland not indicting Trump soon enough.\n\n\"In recent weeks, President Biden has grumbled to aides and advisers that had Garland moved sooner in his investigation into former President Donald Trump's

criminal conviction against Trump really hand Biden the election?\n\nA Ledger 360 poll for the New York Post showed Trump beating Biden 46 to 44 percent if Trump is found not guilty in his criminal bases.\n\nIf Trump is found guilty but not imprisoned, Biden leads Trump by 5 points, 44 to 39.\n\nShould Trump be found guilty and sent to jail, Biden leads 45 to 37 percent.\n\nIn either case of a criminal conviction, no voters actually move to Joe Biden.\n\nBiden's support is flat.\n\nSome Trump voters move to undecided or third party candidates.\n\nThese polls show that it's highly likely voters think Trump is barred from being President if convicted of a crime.\n\nPolls also show a majority of Americans believe the charges against Trump to be politically motivated.\n\nOnce they learn that Trump can be President no matter what, will a criminal conviction they believe is the result of politics stop them from voting for Trump?\n\nThe lack of support moving to Biden as the result of a criminal conviction suggests Trump can win these voters back once they learn the truth.", "source": {"uri": "renewedright.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Renewed Right"}, "authors": [],

A growing economy could inspire confidence in Biden's leadership ahead of the election, but the issue of persistent inflation could ruin that.\n\nBiden, who was in Wisconsin to tout his record on the economy and to announce an investment by Microsoft to build a factory, defended his handling of inflation. Polls show voters are nervous and critical of Biden's handling of the economy and anchor Erin Burnett reminded him that grocery prices are up 30 percent. But Biden, in his interview with CNN, claimed the polls are wrong and Americans struggling with inflation have more cash in their pockets, saying: 'They have the money to spend.'\n\nHe did admit that inflation, one of the biggest factors that sank Biden's popularity in the first half of his term, was real. 'It is real, but the fact is that if you take a look at what people have, they have the money to spend,' he claimed. He blamed 'greedy corporations' for consumers' lack of confidence. 'It angers them and it angers me that you have to spend more. For example, the whole idea of this notion that you have... shrinkflation... It's like 20% less for the same price, that is corporate greed. It is corporate greed and we've got to deal with it.' Many were enraged on social media by Biden's comments while Americans continue to struggle. One critic wrote: 'Most people don't have the money because they are honest, unlike pathological lying Joe!' Another said: 'He is the most clueless president this country has ever had and that is the way history will remember him. The man is out of touch with EVERYTHING,' added another.\n\nIn a recent CNN poll, Biden's approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) were in the negative zone. And voters cite the economy as their concern when picking a president. 'The polling data has been wrong all along,' Biden said of the numbers, questioning the effectiveness of phone surveys. 'We've already turned it around,' Biden said in response to a question on whether, less than six months before Election Day, he was running short on time to improve voters view of him. I think I'm feeling good about the trajectory of the campaign. And, and you know, as far as I do, most people don't really focus and make up their mind till the fall. There's a lot going on,' he noted.\n\nIn an interview with CNN that was conducted in the battleground state of Wisconsin , Biden also explained why he thinks the polls are wrong and warned Israel he would withhold U.S. weapons if it invades Rafah. He also conceded he is watching the coverage of Trump's hush money trial in New York - which included shocking testimony from adult star Stormy Daniels - and even had kind words for his Republican rival who remains stuck in a New York court room. It was a rare sit-down interview for the president with a major news outlet. He has mostly spoken to friendlier outlets - like the 'Smartless' podcast and radio host Howard Stern.\n\nBiden sounded hoarse in the 30 minute interview, which aired Wednesday night but didn't hold back when it came to sounding off against his Republican rival even has he said he prays for Trump. 'God love him,' he said when asked about Trump's hush-money trial in New York. And added he's tracking it 'only on the evening news.' He also predicted, like in their 2020 contest, that Trump won't accept the results of the November election. 'I promise you he won't,' he told CNN's Erin Burnett. 'He won't, which is dangerous.'\n\nHe also revealed what Obama advised him when it came to his rematch with Trump. 'Keep doing what you're doing,' he said. Trump has repeatedly - and falsely - claimed to be the victim of voter fraud and the true winner of the 2020 election. Multiple recounts and investigations have shown Biden was the victor. The former president faces state charges in Georgia on charges he and his allies tried to overturn Biden's victory there. But a Georgia appeals court on Wednesday delayed Trump's criminal case in that state, agreeing to hear an appeal from the former president that may foreclose a trial taking place this year. Trump faces four counts on the federal level tied to the January 6th insurrection on Capitol Hill. But the case is on hold awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether or not Trump, as president at the time, has immunity.\n\nBiden's re-election team has touted their massive fundraising numbers and on-the-ground operation in battleground states. They also point out Trump is required to be in New York for the trial. 'By the end of this month, we will have at least 200 offices and 500 staff,' said Dan Kanninen, director of battleground states for the campaign, in a briefing with reporters on Tuesday. 'The Trump campaign has virtually no presence in most of the battleground states. If they decide to do any organizing work at all, they will almost certainly be forced to rely on expensive and last-minute tactics with folks who have never set foot in a community in which they're knocking doors.' National polls show a statistical tie between Biden and Trump. But, in several polls of key battleground states, the former president leads. With six months to go, anything can happen and a lot of factors remain in play.\n\nBiden, as of late, has shifted tactics on Trump. He's taken to mocking his Republican rival throwing out zingers that call into question everything from the former president's energy levels to his hair. At the White House Correspondents Dinner last month, Biden even mocked Trump's hush money trial in New York noting his rival is facing 'stormy days' - a reference to adult star Stormy Daniels. And, at fundraisers lately, Biden has been talking about a 'defeated-looking' man who had complained to him about a 'crushing debt.' 'And I had to look at him and say, 'Donald, I'm sorry. I can't help you,' Biden said. The donors in the audience typically burst into applause and cheers. Trump is facing multiple trials on the state and federal level: including a hush-money case in New York, a federal case over his handling of classified documents, and both federal and state charges he tried to overturn the 2020 election results. He's gotten a few breaks however and it's looking more-and-more likely he won't face any more courtroom time - once the hush-money trial is finished - until after the election.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is dealing with an unstable Middle East and progressives who are unhappy with his staunch support of Israel and the treatment of Palestinian refugees. Then there is Robert Kennedy Jr.'s independent presidential bid. Both Trump and Biden's teams are worried Kennedy could play a spoiler role, taking voters away from each of them. Trump has ramped up his criticism of RFK Jr., and Biden rolled out a dozen endorsements from the Kennedy family to counter RFK Jr.'s use of the clan's political legacy. Biden's health remains an issue. The president will turn 82 just weeks after Election Day, Nov. 5, and is already the oldest president in U.S. history; Trump is 77. And his approval rating remains at a low 38 percent, per Gallup polling.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN --\n\nPresident Joe Biden sat down with CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday for a rare, one-on-one television interview with a member of the national media.\n\nThey talked in Wisconsin, where Biden is trying to highlight a plan to build up manufacturing and tech jobs in the Midwest. The interview also comes as Biden trails former President Donald Trump in multiple national and swing-state polls and as Biden's policy supporting Israel has driven a wedge between him and younger, progressive voters Democrats rely on.\n\nHere are some key lines from the interview:\n\n\u25ba On polling data that shows him trailing Trump on the economy and whether he is running out of time to turn around perceptions of the economy before Election Day:\n\nBiden pointed to polling he said suggests a majority of people were satisfied with their own situation. \"They think the nation's not in good shape, but they're personally in good shape,\" Biden said.\n\nWhite House advisers have previously pointed to a University of Michigan survey that has shown a general uptick in consumer sentiment.\n\nRegarding inflation, he agreed that people feel day-to-day pain in the increased price of groceries and other items they need, but he argued it is more about anger than being unable to afford things.\n\n\"They have the money to spend. It angers them and it angers me that they have to spend more,\" he argued, before talking about \"corporate greed\" being responsible.\n\nIn a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released in late April, a majority of Americans, 70%, said economic conditions in the US were poor, and there was similarly dismal approval of Biden's handling of the economy. On the subject of personal finances, CNN's polling director Jennifer Agiesta wrote:\n\nAmericans' perceptions of their own finances also remain negative, with 53% saying they are dissatisfied with their personal financial situation while 47% are satisfied. Dissatisfaction is starkly prevalent among those with lower incomes (67% dissatisfied in households with annual incomes lower than $50,000), people of color (64% say they are dissatisfied) and younger Americans (61% of those younger than 45 say they are dissatisfied).\n\n\u25ba On why people should believe him on the economy rather than Trump:\n\nBiden was in Wisconsin to notch a win where a Trump plan failed.\n\nTrump, during his presidency, announced a deal to entice the Taiwanese company Foxconn to build up tech manufacturing jobs in the Midwest. That never came to be, and the Foxconn site in Racine, Wisconsin, was largely abandoned. Biden visited the area to announce a plan by Microsoft to build a data hub there to train workers on how best to use artificial intelligence.\n\nBiden's claim of 15 million jobs being created in the US during his administration is correct, but it lacks the context that so many jobs were temporarily lost during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBiden later argued he was coming at the economy form \"a Scranton perspective\" while Trump was coming from \"a Mar-a-Lago perspective.\"\n\n\u25ba On how seriously he takes the threat that if Trump believes the election is not \"honest,\" the former president again won't accept the election results:\n\n\"The guy is not a democrat with a small d,\" Biden said, suggesting Trump does not believe in democracy. He added that Trump, if reelected, has promised to use his attorney general to target certain people and to be his supporters' \"retribution.\"\n\n\"What president has ever said anything like this stuff?\" Biden said. \"And he means it.\"\n\nBiden said the leaders of other democracies are rooting for him.\n\n\"Eighty percent of them after we have a major meeting, they go, you have to win for my democracy to stick - their democracy to stick,\" Biden said.\n\n\u25ba On being called \"genocide Joe\" at pro-Palestinian protests on US college campuses and whether he hears the message of young Americans:\n\nBut Biden expanded, suggesting protesters have gone too far:\n\nThere is a legitimate right to free speech and protest. There's a legitimate right to do that and they have a right to do that. But there's not a legitimate right to use hate speech. There's not a legitimate right to threaten Jewish students. There is not a legitimate right to block people's access to class. That's against the law.\n\nFrom there, he tried to pivot to explaining that he has counseled Israel to develop better plans for what to do in Gaza, and he compared it with mistakes the US made after 9/11 when it invaded Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\"It made sense to get (Osama) bin Laden; it made no sense to try and unify Afghanistan. It made no sense in my view to engage in thinking that in Iraq they had a nuclear weapon,\" Biden said. Those are both political sore spots for Biden, who pulled US troops from Afghanistan, allowing the Taliban to reassert complete control of the country. He also voted in favor of invading Iraq as a US senator.\n\n\u25ba On whether US bombs have been used to kill civilians in Gaza:\n\nBiden said the US has delayed one shipment of powerful 2,000-pound bombs and that he has told Israelis he will not support their military's plan to conduct operations inside Rafah, in southern Gaza on the Egyptian border.\n\n\"They're not going to get our support if in fact they go on these population centers,\" Biden said, although he promised the US would still help Israel protect itself from outside attacks. \"We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks like came out of the Middle East recently,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_b_wolf@cnn.com", "name": "Zachary B.

As he did during recent official White House and campaign events, he jabbed at Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and defended his economic record.\n\nThe president has joked that his staff dreads when he goes off-script or veers away from the prepared remarks on a teleprompter. And he has given fewer media interviews than his recent predecessors, including Trump.\n\nBut when he does, Biden often is more candid than when he is delivering remarks from behind the presidential lectern or even answering reporters' shouted questions, which usually generate four- or five-word answers than can raise even more questions about his policy stances.\n\nHis CNN sit-down was no exception, as Biden delivered his most blunt warning to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet. Here are three takeaways.\n\n'Not supplying the weapons'\n\nBiden told the \"Outfront\" anchor he made clear to Israeli leaders if they conduct military operations in \"population centers\" inside Gaza, he would withhold U.S.-made heavy bombs.\n\nThough his top aides in recent weeks have declined to answer reporters' questions about Israeli military operations inside the Palestinian enclave, he acknowledged on Wednesday that those American-manufactured bombs have been used in the Israeli Defense Forces' deadly bombardment. According to a Hamas-run health agency, almost 35,000 Palestinians have died in Israel's military response to Hamas' attack inside the Jewish state, which killed 1,400 people. Another 78,000 Palestinians have been wounded, according to the same agency.\n\n\"I made it clear that, if they go into Rafah - they haven't gone into Rafah yet. If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem,\" Biden said. He appeared to say the goal was to limit Israel's ability to go on offense, not to defend itself.\n\n\"We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure, in terms of Iron Dome [missile defense system] and their ability to respond to attacks like [the one that] came out of the Middle East recently,\" he said, citing heavy bombs and artillery shells as weapons he would withhold.\n\nBiden's warning, if it becomes reality, would upend 76 years of American foreign policy. U.S. presidents from both political parties have staunchly supported Israel and supplied it with military assistance. As recently as last week, Biden declared his support for Tel Aviv was \"ironclad.\"\n\nThe United States was the first country to recognize Israel in 1948. \"The 75-year partnership has been built on mutual interests and shared democratic values from its inception, with Israelis and Americans united by their commitment to democracy, economic prosperity, and regional security,\" a State Department fact sheet said.\n\nThat partnership - and regional security - may be on the ropes.\n\nTrump, who also has criticized Netanyahu, panned Biden on Thursday.\n\n\"What Biden is doing with respect to Israel is disgraceful. If any Jewish person voted for Joe Biden, they should be ashamed of themselves,\" Trump told reporters staking out his trial in New York City. \"He's totally abandoned Israel and nobody can believe it. I guess he feels good about it. Because he did it as a political decision, you have to do the right decision, not the political decision. But he did a very bad thing.\"\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Thursday accused Biden of a \"100 percent political calculation\" and said he is \"defying the will of Congress,\" which recently passed an aid package for the Jewish state.\n\nJohn Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, on Thursday contended Israeli leaders have known \"for some time now\" about Biden's intent to withhold such weapons if they went hard militarily into the refugee-packed Rafah area. He also disclosed that Biden's threat was based on \"what we were seeing and hearing from the Israelis\" in terms of their planning for a Rafah operation.\n\n\"It's going to depend on Israel's decision-making right now,\" Kirby said. U.S. officials intend to keep pitching \"alternative\" options to \"smashing into Rafah\" with Israeli officials, he said, adding the Biden administration also intends to hold discussions with their Israeli counterparts about an \"alternative governing structure to Hamas\" inside Gaza.\n\n'Wrong all along'\n\nTrump continues to hold a polling advantage - nationally and in battleground states - over Biden on economic issues. Biden was defiant, and he blames the polls.\n\n\"We have already turned it around,\" he said of the economy. \"Look, look at the Michigan survey, where 65 percent of the American people think they're in good shape economically. They think the nation's not in good shape, but they're personally in good shape,\" the president said, not specifying to which survey he was referring to.\n\n\"The polling data has been wrong all along. ... You guys do a poll at CNN. How many folks [do] you have to call to get one response? The idea that we're in a situation where things are so bad, the folks that - I mean, we have created more jobs,\" Biden said. \"We're in a situation where people have access to good-paying jobs.\n\n\"And the last I saw, the combination of the inflation, the cost of inflation and all those things, that's really worrisome to people, with good reason,\" he added.\n\n'Promise you he won't'\n\nIn recent media interviews, Trump has done little to quell worries among many Democrats that, should he again lose to Biden, he will refuse to accept the election results - and possibly even urge his loyalists to violence.\n\nBiden said Wednesday Trump should be taken at his word.\n\n\"The guy is not a Democrat with a small d,\" Biden said. \"Look, you can't only love your country when you win, No. 1. How many court cases did they have, Supreme Court cases?\n\n\"They all said, 'This is a totally legitimate election,'\" he said, referring to the nine high court justices. \"This is Trump. ... He may not accept the outcome of the election. I promise you he won't.\n\nIn a recent interview with TIME magazine, Trump said this when asked if political violence is possible if he loses again.\n\n\"If we don't win, you know, it depends,\" Trump said.\n\n\"It always depends on the fairness of an election. I don't believe they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time. I don't think they'll be able to get away with it,\" he said, making more never-proved allegations about shenanigans by Democrats in the 2020 election. \"And if that's the case, we're gonna win in record-setting fashion.\"", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cq_roll_call@sunherald.com", "name": "CQ-Roll Call", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "john_t_bennett@sunherald.com", "name": "John T.

As he did during recent official White House and campaign events, he jabbed at Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and defended his economic record.\n\nThe president has joked that his staff dreads when he goes off-script or veers away from the prepared remarks on a teleprompter. And he has given fewer media interviews than his recent predecessors, including Trump.\n\nBut when he does, Biden often is more candid than when he is delivering remarks from behind the presidential lectern or even answering reporters' shouted questions, which usually generate four- or five-word answers than can raise even more questions about his policy stances.\n\nHis CNN sit-down was no exception, as Biden delivered his most blunt warning to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet. Here are three takeaways.\n\nBiden told the \"Outfront\" anchor he made clear to Israeli leaders if they conduct military operations in \"population centers\" inside Gaza, he would withhold U.S.-made heavy bombs.\n\nThough his top aides in recent weeks have declined to answer reporters' questions about Israeli military operations inside the Palestinian enclave, he acknowledged on Wednesday that those American-manufactured bombs have been used in the Israeli Defense Forces' deadly bombardment. According to a Hamas-run health agency, almost 35,000 Palestinians have died in Israel's military response to Hamas' attack inside the Jewish state, which killed 1,400 people. Another 78,000 Palestinians have been wounded, according to the same agency.\n\n\"I made it clear that, if they go into Rafah -- they haven't gone into Rafah yet. If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem,\" Biden said. He appeared to say the goal was to limit Israel's ability to go on offense, not to defend itself.\n\n\"We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure, in terms of Iron Dome [missile defense system] and their ability to respond to attacks like [the one that] came out of the Middle East recently,\" he said, citing heavy bombs and artillery shells as weapons he would withhold.\n\nBiden's warning, if it becomes reality, would upend 76 years of American foreign policy. U.S. presidents from both political parties have staunchly supported Israel and supplied it with military assistance. As recently as last week, Biden declared his support for Tel Aviv was \"ironclad.\"\n\nThe United States was the first country to recognize Israel in 1948. \"The 75-year partnership has been built on mutual interests and shared democratic values from its inception, with Israelis and Americans united by their commitment to democracy, economic prosperity, and regional security,\" a State Department fact sheet said.\n\nThat partnership -- and regional security -- may be on the ropes.\n\nTrump, who also has criticized Netanyahu, panned Biden on Thursday.\n\n\"What Biden is doing with respect to Israel is disgraceful. If any Jewish person voted for Joe Biden, they should be ashamed of themselves,\" Trump told reporters staking out his trial in New York City. \"He's totally abandoned Israel and nobody can believe it. I guess he feels good about it. Because he did it as a political decision, you have to do the right decision, not the political decision. But he did a very bad thing.\"\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Thursday accused Biden of a \"100 percent political calculation\" and said he is \"defying the will of Congress,\" which recently passed an aid package for the Jewish state.\n\nJohn Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, on Thursday contended Israeli leaders have known \"for some time now\" about Biden's intent to withhold such weapons if they went hard militarily into the refugee-packed Rafah area. He also disclosed that Biden's threat was based on \"what we were seeing and hearing from the Israelis\" in terms of their planning for a Rafah operation.\n\n\"It's going to depend on Israel's decision-making right now,\" Kirby said. U.S. officials intend to keep pitching \"alternative\" options to \"smashing into Rafah\" with Israeli officials, he said, adding the Biden administration also intends to hold discussions with their Israeli counterparts about an \"alternative governing structure to Hamas\" inside Gaza.\n\nTrump continues to hold a polling advantage -- nationally and in battleground states -- over Biden on economic issues. Biden was defiant, and he blames the polls.\n\n\"We have already turned it around,\" he said of the economy. \"Look, look at the Michigan survey, where 65 percent of the American people think they're in good shape economically. They think the nation's not in good shape, but they're personally in good shape,\" the president said, not specifying to which survey he was referring to.\n\n\"The polling data has been wrong all along. ... You guys do a poll at CNN. How many folks [do] you have to call to get one response? The idea that we're in a situation where things are so bad, the folks that -- I mean, we have created more jobs,\" Biden said. \"We're in a situation where people have access to good-paying jobs.\n\n\"And the last I saw, the combination of the inflation, the cost of inflation and all those things, that's really worrisome to people, with good reason,\" he added.\n\nIn recent media interviews, Trump has done little to quell worries among many Democrats that, should he again lose to Biden, he will refuse to accept the election results -- and possibly even urge his loyalists to violence.\n\nBiden said Wednesday Trump should be taken at his word.\n\n\"The guy is not a Democrat with a small d,\" Biden said. \"Look, you can't only love your country when you win, No. 1. How many court cases did they have, Supreme Court cases?\n\n\"They all said, 'This is a totally legitimate election,'\" he said, referring to the nine high court justices. \"This is Trump. ... He may not accept the outcome of the election. I promise you he won't.\n\nIn a recent interview with TIME magazine, Trump said this when asked if political violence is possible if he loses again.\n\n\"If we don't win, you know, it depends,\" Trump said.\n\n\"It always depends on the fairness of an election. I don't believe they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time. I don't think they'll be able to get away with it,\" he said, making more never-proved allegations about shenanigans by Democrats in the 2020 election. \"And if that's the case, we're gonna win in record-setting fashion.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_t_bennett@rollcall.com", "name": "John T.

The interview also comes as Biden trails former President Donald Trump in multiple national and swing-state polls and as Biden's policy supporting Israel has driven a wedge between him and younger, progressive voters Democrats rely on.\n\nHere are some key lines from the interview:\n\n\u25ba On polling data that shows him trailing Trump on the economy and whether he is running out of time to turn around perceptions of the economy before Election Day:\n\nBiden pointed to polling he said suggests a majority of people were satisfied with their own situation. \"They think the nation's not in good shape, but they're personally in good shape,\" Biden said.\n\nWhite House advisers have previously pointed to a University of Michigan survey that has shown a general uptick in consumer sentiment.\n\nRegarding inflation, he agreed that people feel day-to-day pain in the increased price of groceries and other items they need, but he argued it is more about anger than being unable to afford things.\n\n\"They have the money to spend. It angers them and it angers me that they have to spend more,\" he argued, before talking about \"corporate greed\" being responsible.\n\nIn a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released in late April, a majority of Americans, 70%, said economic conditions in the US were poor, and there was similarly dismal approval of Biden's handling of the economy. On the subject of personal finances, CNN's polling director Jennifer Agiesta wrote:\n\nAmericans' perceptions of their own finances also remain negative, with 53% saying they are dissatisfied with their personal financial situation while 47% are satisfied. Dissatisfaction is starkly prevalent among those with lower incomes (67% dissatisfied in households with annual incomes lower than $50,000), people of color (64% say they are dissatisfied) and younger Americans (61% of those younger than 45 say they are dissatisfied).\n\n\u25ba On why people should believe him on the economy rather than Trump:\n\nBiden was in Wisconsin to notch a win where a Trump plan failed.\n\nTrump, during his presidency, announced a deal to entice the Taiwanese company Foxconn to build up tech manufacturing jobs in the Midwest. That never came to be, and the Foxconn site in Racine, Wisconsin, was largely abandoned. Biden visited the area to announce a plan by Microsoft to build a data hub there to train workers on how best to use artificial intelligence.\n\nBiden's claim of 15 million jobs being created in the US during his administration is correct, but it lacks the context that so many jobs were temporarily lost during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBiden later argued he was coming at the economy form \"a Scranton perspective\" while Trump was coming from \"a Mar-a-Lago perspective.\"\n\n\u25ba On how seriously he takes the threat that if Trump believes the election is not \"honest,\" the former president again won't accept the election results:\n\n\"The guy is not a democrat with a small d,\" Biden said, suggesting Trump does not believe in democracy. He added that Trump, if reelected, has promised to use his attorney general to target certain people and to be his supporters' \"retribution.\"\n\n\"What president has ever said anything like this stuff?\" Biden said. \"And he means it.\"\n\nBiden said the leaders of other democracies are rooting for him.\n\n\"Eighty percent of them after we have a major meeting, they go, you have to win for my democracy to stick - their democracy to stick,\" Biden said.\n\n\u25ba On being called \"genocide Joe\" at pro-Palestinian protests on US college campuses and whether he hears the message of young Americans:\n\nBut Biden expanded, suggesting protesters have gone too far:\n\nThere is a legitimate right to free speech and protest. There's a legitimate right to do that and they have a right to do that. But there's not a legitimate right to use hate speech. There's not a legitimate right to threaten Jewish students. There is not a legitimate right to block people's access to class. That's against the law.\n\nFrom there, he tried to pivot to explaining that he has counseled Israel to develop better plans for what to do in Gaza, and he compared it with mistakes the US made after 9/11 when it invaded Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\"It made sense to get (Osama) bin Laden; it made no sense to try and unify Afghanistan. It made no sense in my view to engage in thinking that in Iraq they had a nuclear weapon,\" Biden said. Those are both political sore spots for Biden, who pulled US troops from Afghanistan, allowing the Taliban to reassert complete control of the country. He also voted in favor of invading Iraq as a US senator.\n\n\u25ba On whether US bombs have been used to kill civilians in Gaza:\n\nBiden said the US has delayed one shipment of powerful 2,000-pound bombs and that he has told Israelis he will not support their military's plan to conduct operations inside Rafah, in southern Gaza on the Egyptian border.\n\n\"They're not going to get our support if in fact they go on these population centers,\" Biden said, although he promised the US would still help Israel protect itself from outside attacks. \"We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks like came out of the Middle East recently,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

My democracy is at stake.'\"\n\nBiden cited Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail suggesting he would prosecute his political opponents and his vow to repeal major Democratic legislation that lowered the cost of certain prescription drugs, as well as a pledge to implement a 10 percent tariff on imports.\n\nTrump has continued to push the false claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent and rigged against him, despite numerous court cases on the matter being dismissed and election officials at the federal and state level rebutting his claims.\n\nRioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to stop the certification of Biden's victory after Trump had called for supporters to rally in Washington, D.C., that day.\n\nLast week, the former president indicated he would be reluctant to accept the results if he loses.\n\n\"If everything's honest, I'd gladly accept the results,\" Trump told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an interview Wednesday. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\nOne of the core pillars of Biden's reelection campaign has been warning voters that Trump poses a grave threat to democracy. But Trump leads Biden in battleground state polling, and the two are neck-and-neck in national polls.\n\nBiden told CNN on Wednesday that he felt good about the state of his campaign, pointing to the strong organization his operation has compared to Trump, who has yet to open field offices in battleground states and has lagged behind in staffing.\n\n\"We're doing the block and tackling. We're going out and making sure we knock on doors, get folks out the old-fashioned way,\" Biden said. \"I think I'm feeling good about the trajectory of the campaign.

Voters doubt they're working.", "body": "Voters say they don't know very much about President Joe Biden's major domestic spending initiatives. They don't think they're working. And they don't give him credit for their benefits, anyway.\n\nThose are among the key takeaways from a new POLITICO-Morning Consult poll about four major laws passed in the first two years of Biden's administration -- and the impact that spending has had on voters and the communities around them.\n\nOf the four laws passed in 2021 or 2022, only Biden's climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, garnered a majority of poll respondents who said they'd heard \"a lot\" or even \"some\" about it. Few voters said the clean energy and infrastructure projects that Biden is championing have had a major impact in their communities or increased jobs.\n\nVoters even give former President Donald Trump almost as much credit as Biden for advancing infrastructure spending -- even though Trump's succession of accomplishment-free \"Infrastructure Weeks\" became a running joke during his administration.\n\nTrailing Trump in the polls for months, Biden has sought to elevate the extensive federal spending on infrastructure, climate change and other projects to bolster his economic record. His campaign has run ads touting these laws in seven battleground states to boost recognition and counter voters' inflation-driven pessimism about the economy.\n\nHis messages aren't landing -- at least not beyond voters who don't already identify as Democrats. Republicans are characteristically averse to crediting Biden, but so are self-identified independents, some of whom are the kinds of swing voters who could determine the result of the November election.\n\nThe POLITICO-Morning Consult poll (toplines, crosstabs) was conducted April 27-28 as part of POLITICO's \"Biden's Billions\" series, which is examining the impact of the president's efforts to use the legislation to revive manufacturing, transform the economy and take on issues such as climate change. The poll surveyed 1,974 registered voters online and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nHere are four takeaways from the results.\n\nMajorities of poll respondents said they haven't seen, read or heard anything or much about three of Biden's four major spending laws: The 2021 American Rescue Plan, the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. The poll found greater awareness of the Inflation Reduction Act, but still only 17 percent said they've heard \"a lot\" about it, and 35 percent said they'd heard \"some\" about it.\n\nOf the four, the CHIPS and Science Act has the lowest profile. Only 9 percent of respondents said they'd heard \"a lot\" about it, while another 23 percent said they'd heard \"some.\"\n\nVoters with higher incomes and higher levels of educational attainment tended to be slightly more likely to say they had heard about the laws.\n\nThe greatest divide in the survey data falls along party lines. Self-identified Democrats are more likely to say they have seen, read or heard about the laws than Republicans or independents -- and are far more likely to see them as personally beneficial or helping their communities.\n\nFor example, 37 percent of Democratic voters said the Inflation Reduction Act has impacted them positively, compared with only 12 percent of Republicans and 15 percent of independents. And 44 percent of Democrats said the bipartisan infrastructure law has positively impacted their community -- far more than the 15 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of independents who agreed.\n\nThe poll also suggests another problem for Biden: Broadly speaking, few voters say they're seeing the federal government's efforts to revitalize the nation's infrastructure or build up a clean energy sector.\n\nOnly a quarter of voters, 25 percent, said \"the clean energy and infrastructure projects approved since 2021\" had increased jobs in their community. Thirty percent said they've had no impact, and another 28 percent didn't know or had no opinion.\n\nFor the four specific laws tested -- even when restricted to poll respondents who said they'd heard something about them -- only around 25 percent said they had positively impacted them personally.\n\nAsked about the combined impact of federal spending on infrastructure in their community since Biden became president, 26 percent said it had a \"major impact,\" another 26 percent said it had a \"minor impact\" and 30 percent said it had \"no impact.\" Eighteen percent of respondents had no opinion.\n\nBiden can keep trying to champion infrastructure during the course of the campaign, but voters aren't praising it right now.\n\nMany voters aren't giving Biden credit when they do see positive benefits.\n\nWhen he signed the infrastructure bill into law in 2021, Biden famously succeeded where Trump had failed. But asked who has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and job creation, nearly as many voters said Trump (37 percent) as Biden (40 percent). Twelve percent said they've both done about the same, and another 12 percent had no opinion.\n\nUnsurprisingly, party identification is the key driver on this question. About three-in-four Democrats, 74 percent, said Biden has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and jobs -- but an almost identical number of Republicans, 70 percent, said it's Trump who's done more. Among independents, roughly the same number picked Biden (34 percent) and Trump (32 percent).\n\nBiden also has a slight edge among voters in the presidential battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- leading Trump on the question of who gets more credit, 42 percent to 36 percent.\n\nThe Biden campaign's most-aired TV ad seeks to make this point specifically: \"For four years, Donald Trump tried to pass an infrastructure law -- and he failed,\" Biden says in the spot, which has been backed by $4.6 million in spending, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political advertising. \"I got it done. Now we're rebuilding America.\"\n\nBut on virtually every question about the spending bills -- including whether Biden or Trump gets more credit -- the poll numbers among respondents in electoral swing states did not meaningfully differ from the overall results.

House Republicans and lawyers for Trump sought to overturn the state's election, which Biden won.\n\n\"It's a major backdrop to this election cycle,\" said Christopher Borick, director of the college's Institute of Public Opinion. \"Of course, that comes from messaging from the top of the Republican Party and the top of the Republican Party is Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe poll gave Trump a 3-point lead, 44% to 41%, in a head-to-head matchup with Biden, well within the survey's margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. With third-party candidates, Trump and Biden are tied at 35% with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 18%.\n\nAnd U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., led former hedge fund CEO David McCormick, 45% to 41%, also within the poll's margin of error. The survey of 417 registered voters was taken April 15-25.\n\nThe Biden campaign announced Wednesday that it would spend another $14 million on advertising in Pennsylvania and other battleground states, focusing on health care, including ads targeting Black, Hispanic and Asian American voters.\n\nTrump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which covers 371,516 Pennsylvanians, and nominated three of the six U.S. Supreme Court justices that overturned the right to abortion.\n\nAs part of their effort, Biden campaign officials said they would reach out to the 155,000 Republicans who voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the Pennsylvania primary on April 23, more than a month since she dropped out the presidential race.\n\n\"We are not taking any voters for granted,\" said Quentin Fulks, principal deputy campaign manager for Biden's re-election campaign. \"We are showing up in communities every day.\"\n\nTrump railed against the 2020 election over the weekend at the Republican National Committee spring meeting and donor retreat at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhlenberg_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhlenberg College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Casey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Casey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

For example, the whole idea of this notion that you have... shrinkflation... It's like 20% less for the same price, that is corporate greed. It is corporate greed and we've got to deal with it.'\n\nMany were enraged on social media by Biden's comments while Americans continue to struggle.\n\nOne critic wrote: 'Most people don't have the money because they are honest, unlike pathological lying Joe!'\n\nAnother said: 'He is the most clueless president this country has ever had and that is the way history will remember him.'\n\n'The man is out of touch with EVERYTHING,' added another.\n\nHe did admit that inflation, one of the biggest factors that sank Biden's popularity in the first half of his term, was real. But he instead chose to blame 'greedy corporations' for consumers lack of confidence\n\nA growing economy could inspire confidence in Biden's leadership ahead of the election, but the issue of persistent inflation could ruin that\n\nIn a recent CNN poll, Biden's approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) were in the negative zone. And voters cite the economy as their concern when picking a president.\n\n'The polling data has been wrong all along,' Biden said of the numbers, questioning the effectiveness of phone surveys.\n\n'We've already turned it around,' Biden said in response to a question on whether, less than six months before Election Day, he was running short on time to improve voters view of him.\n\n'I think I'm feeling good about the trajectory of the campaign. And, and you know, as far as I do, most people don't really focus and make up their mind till the fall. There's a lot going on,' he noted.\n\nIn an interview with CNN that was conducted in the battleground state of Wisconsin, Biden also explained why he thinks the polls are wrong and warned Israel he would withhold U.S. weapons if it invades Rafah.\n\nHe also conceded he is watching the coverage of Trump's hush money trial in New York - which included shocking testimony from porn star Stormy Daniels - and even had kind words for his Republican rival who remains stuck in a New York court room.\n\nIt was a rare sitdown interview for the president with a major news outlet. He has mostly spoken to friendlier outlets - like the 'Smartless' podcast and radio host Howard Stern.\n\nPresident Biden sat down for an interview with CNN, a rare interview with a major news outlet\n\nBiden sounded hoarse in the 30 minute interview, which aired Wednesday night but didn't hold back when it came to sounding off against his Republican rival even has he said he prays for Trump.\n\n'God love him,' he said when asked about Trump's hush-money trial in New York.\n\nAnd added he's tracking it 'only on the evening news.'\n\nHe also predicted, like in their 2020 contest, that Trump won't accept the results of the November election.\n\n'I promise you he won't,' he told CNN's Erin Burnett. 'He won't, which is dangerous.'\n\nHe also revealed what Obama advised him when it came to his rematch with Trump.\n\n'Keep doing what you're doing,' he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly - and falsely - claimed to be the victim of voter fraud and the true winner of the 2020 election. Multiple recounts and investigations have shown Biden was the victor.\n\nThe former president faces state charges in Georgia on charges he and his allies tried to overturn Biden's victory there.\n\nBut a Georgia appeals court on Wednesday delayed Trump's criminal case in that state, agreeing to hear an appeal from the former president that may foreclose a trial taking place this year.\n\nTrump faces four counts on the federal level tied to the January 6th insurrection on Capitol Hill. But the case is on hold awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether or not Trump, as president at the time, has immunity.\n\n'God love him,' Biden said of Donald Trump (above), who is in New York on trial\n\nIn this courtroom sketch, defense attorney Susan Necheles, center, cross examines Stormy Daniels, far right, as former President Donald Trump, left, looks on\n\nBiden's re-election team has touted their massive fundraising numbers and on-the-ground operation in battleground states. They also point out Trump is required to be in New York for the trial.\n\n'By the end of this month, we will have at least 200 offices and 500 staff,' said Dan Kanninen, director of battleground states for the campaign, in a briefing with reporters on Tuesday.\n\n'The Trump campaign has virtually no presence in most of the battleground states. If they decide to do any organizing work at all, they will almost certainly be forced to rely on expensive and last-minute tactics with folks who have never set foot in a community in which they're knocking doors.'\n\nNational polls show a statistical tie between Biden and Trump. But, in several polls of key battleground states, the former president leads.\n\nWith six months to go, anything can happen and a lot of factors remain in play.\n\nBiden, as of late, has shifted tactics on Trump. He's taken to mocking his Republican rival throwing out zingers that call into question everything from the former president's energy levels to his hair.\n\nAt the White House Correspondents Dinner last month, Biden even mocked Trump's hush money trial in New York noting his rival is facing 'stormy days' - a reference to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nAnd, at fundraisers lately, Biden has been talking about a 'defeated-looking' man who had complained to him about a 'crushing debt.'\n\n'And I had to look at him and say, 'Donald, I'm sorry.

And in his remarks Wednesday, Biden plans to directly point his finger at Trump for that failure, according to a White House official.\n\nThe sprawling stretch of Racine County, which sits between Chicago and Milwaukee, has been at the center of an intense local political debate over the development through one whipsaw election after another. Residents who live and work nearby told CNN they were happy to see the projects -- and the jobs -- but it was hardly a guarantee that their own economic anxieties would be allayed.\n\n\"Things are really uncertain, not knowing what's going to happen with interest rates and what's going to happen with the whole economy,\" said Dave Flannery, whose family operates the Apple Holler orchard and farm just a few miles from where Biden is set to visit on Wednesday. \"Personally, I'm very optimistic in terms of our future, but at times it's very scary out there.\"\n\nTom Osterhaus, whose family owns Cozy Nook Farm about an hour away near Waukesha, said inflation is one of the biggest criticisms he has about the Biden administration. While he's not a huge admirer of Trump and hoped for a Republican alternative, he said he would gladly return to the economic policies of the Trump era.\n\n\"You get your paycheck and it looks good, but when you pay the bills out, it's like, 'Wow, it's all gone,'\" Osterhaus said. \"To me, inflation is the big overriding problem economically.\"\n\nAsked whether it was fair to place the blame entirely on Biden, Osterhaus said: \"They are the administration that's in power.\"\n\nAt the outset of his term, Biden told some Democratic colleagues he planned to be the \"most progressive president since FDR,\" the architect of the New Deal.\n\nBiden has spent the last two years on the road touting the trillions of dollars of infrastructure and construction spending that resulted from legislation he signed, much of it passed through Congress on a bipartisan basis. But leading economists have argued the very funding that helped fuel economic growth also caused rising prices -- clouding Biden's ability to sell those achievements to voters.\n\n\"It's important for him to be here to hammer home his economic messages and make it real for people,\" Mandela Barnes, the state's former lieutenant governor, told CNN. \"Some people are still thinking about the $1,500 check they got from Trump.\"\n\nIn CNN's most recent poll, Biden's approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remain starkly negative, as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests.\n\nAs Biden leans into the unfinished business of his 2020 campaign -- and urges voters to let him \"finish the job\" in 2024 -- multiple outside advisers and donors have expressed worry the president is tacking too far to the left. The concern: A platform containing costly proposals like universal preschool, subsidized child and senior care, and expanded health care cater less to moderates than to the party's base.\n\n\"One-eighth of one percent of the population is going to decide this election,\" one longtime Biden donor tells CNN, requesting anonymity to share confidential conversations with the campaign. \"I've told them to move more toward the middle.\"\n\nYet Biden is also still working to shore up his own progressive base, a task complicated by the rising outrage over the administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nWednesday will be Biden's fourth trip to Wisconsin so far this year, an indication of how central the state is to the President's reelection roadmap. Wisconsin is a pillar of the so-called blue wall with Michigan and Pennsylvania -- all three of which Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped four years later.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by fewer than 21,000 votes. And with a similarly small margin expected to select the 2024 victor, several advisers and former Biden officials have said that striking the right policy tone with moderates this year -- without alienating the party's base -- is paramount.\n\n\"I think that's the No. 1 question,\" a former Biden adviser says of the debate over how progressive to fashion the president's approach. \"Answering that right is the answer of whether Biden wins the election.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign and its acolytes don't see it that way, citing polling that shows the president's agenda has been popular among the party's most loyal voters, as well as independents.\n\n\"He doesn't have to choose between a progressive path and a moderate path,\" said Bharat Ramamurti, Biden's former deputy director of the National Economic Council. \"The agenda he has pursued is the consensus path.\"\n\nAs the Democratic Party's priorities evolve, consensus has taken different forms -- and sometimes required Biden to shift his own positions to the left.\n\nA self-professed capitalist, he pledged during the 2020 campaign not to demonize the rich. Soon after taking office, Biden repeatedly began pushing for policies that tax wealthy individuals and corporations, a shift that emerged from a \"Unity Task Force\" established by the campaign seeking input from progressive economists.\n\nPerhaps no policy is more illustrative of this shift than student loan forgiveness. Biden started out the 2020 campaign supporting only the most limited student loan forgiveness -- such as discharging loans when a borrower declared bankruptcy or died.\n\nBut on the eve of a March 2020 debate with progressive firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was proposing blanket cancellation of student loans, Biden widened his embrace of loan forgiveness. And as president, Biden announced his support for income-based forgiveness that would cancel more than $360 billion in government loans.\n\nWhile that plan was blocked by the Supreme Court, Biden has used regulation and agency authorities to cancel some $146 billion in student debt.\n\n\"It never felt like it was truly something he wanted to do during the campaign,\" said the former Biden adviser. \"And now it's one of his premier economic agenda items.\"\n\nIndividual issues like student loan forgiveness tend to poll well among voters, especially young voters, whose monthly payments are a larger portion of their take-home pay.\n\n\"It's quite striking when you look at the data,\" Ramamurti, the former Biden deputy NEC director and onetime adviser to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, told CNN. The question is whether the votes will follow in November.\n\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny, MJ Lee and Camilla DeChalus contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

One says former President Donald Trump is up, and another gives the nod to President Joe Biden.\n\nHow does a voter make sense of it all?\n\nOne pollster thinks it has an answer: Just ask your neighbor whom he or she is planning to vote for.\n\nLike many consumers of political surveys, pollster TIPP/Insights has been angling to determine who is really leading in the dead heat race.\n\nSo, for its latest analysis, it did a deep dive into the data and found five indicators that Trump could be ahead.\n\nThe headline numbers for its latest survey found Biden with 42% national support and Trump with 40%. It described the race as \"neck and neck\" and within the margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 points.\n\nBut as it dug into other questions, it found an edge for Trump.\n\nFirst, the polling outfit looked at independent voters, who are expected to play an outsize role in the November outcome. Among independents, TIPP said Trump led 35% to 30%.\n\n\"Why is this important? Independents in the last election favored Biden 54% to Trump's 41%. That has, for all intents and purposes, been reversed this time around,\" the analysis said.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nNext, Biden is losing his big advantage among black and Hispanic people. \"African Americans, for instance, gave 87% of their vote to Biden in 2020, compared to just 12% for Trump. But that's changed dramatically in 2024: Black voters say they favor Biden by 59%, a 28% decline from four years ago, while 15% say they back Trump, a three percentage-point gain. All told, it's a 31-point swing,\" TIPP said.\n\n\"Among Hispanics, Biden slammed Trump in 2020, 65% to 32%. In this month's I&I/TIPP Poll, Hispanics give just 47% support to Biden, 26% to Trump, and 13% to Kennedy,\" it added.\n\nVoter support, or intensity for their choice, is also key. The gap favors Trump, 64% to 54%.\n\nThen, there is the question of who voters \"think\" will win. It's Trump again, but closer, 37% to 34%.\n\nBut the kicker, the pollster said, is in the question about who voters think their neighbor will vote for.

TIPP added, \"I&I/TIPP data indicate that even voters who support Biden show a lack of enthusiasm, while most registered voters now expect Trump to win, significant since recent studies indicate such expectations have a high likelihood of becoming reality.\"\n\nOn the question of how neighbors are voting, TIPP concluded, \"The answer is revealing: 43% responded Trump, while just 31% said Biden.

And while the clear intent in his chat with CNN's Erin Burnett was to show a contrast with Donald Trump on the economy, the headline was what the president said about Israel.\n\n\"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah -- they haven't gone into Rafah yet -- but if they go into Rafah , I am not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, that deal with the cities, that deal with that problem,\" Biden said. \"We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks... but it's just wrong. We are not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells that have been used\" by the Israelis.\n\nBiden's comments come amid protests across the United States over Israel's bombing of Gaza, a movement that has divided Democrats. Biden has continued to pledge support to Israel and has condemned the rise of anti-semitism on college campuses. But he told Burnett that after the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to not \"make the same mistake we made in America\" after 9/11.\n\nBiden said that he told Netanyahu, \"We will help you focus on getting the bad guys, but then we got to think through what is happening after Gaza, after this is over. Who is going to occupy Gaza?\"\n\nBiden's comments about stopping weapons were immediately criticized by Republican congressional leaders, while they overshadowed another part of the interview.\n\nCompared to his predecessors, Biden has done relatively few one-on-one sit down interviews with national news outlets, with The New York Times grousing that he has avoided their outlet altogether. Biden did a recent interview with The New Yorker and last fall spoke to 60 Minutes, but the White House strategy has focused in part on local media and non-traditional outlets, like the Smartless podcast and a recent live appearance with Howard Stern.\n\nBiden is certainly not the first president to turn to other types of media, as it's become a common refrain among comms professionals to talk of the need to reach voters \"where they are.\" But there still is a bit of unpredictability to an interview with a national news outlet: Burnett's questioning was far more pointed and direct that Biden likely would get on say, a late-night talk show.\n\nDuring a visit to Milwaukee, Biden tried to show himself as effective in creating jobs while Trump failed to follow through.\n\n\"He's never succeeded in creating jobs, and I have never failed,\" said Biden, as he said that he had created \"over 15 million jobs\" since becoming president. His visit to Wisconsin was to tout a new Microsoft plant at the same place where Trump once promoted a Foxconn facility that was later cut down in size.\n\nTrump \"talked about this being the eighth wonder of the world,\" Biden said. \"When has he ever done anything he said?\"\n\nBurnett, however, noted that, despite the president's insistence of a solid economic record, \"voters by a wide margin, trust Trump more on the economy. They say that in polls, and part of the reason for that may be the numbers.\"\n\nShe added, \"You're aware of many of these, of course. The cost of buying a home in the United States is double what it was when you look at your monthly costs from before the pandemic. Real income, when you account for inflation, is actually down since you took office. Economic growth last week, far short of expectations. Consumer confidence, maybe no surprise, is near a two year low. With less than six months to go to election day, are you worried that you're running out of time to turn that around?\"\n\nBiden cited a survey showing 65% of the American people think they are in good shape economically, even though they think \"the nation's not in good shape.\"\n\n\"The polling data has been wrong all along,\" Biden said. \"You guys do a poll at CNN. How many folks do you have to call to get one response?\"\n\nBurnett, though, noted the impact of inflation, including on areas like housing. Biden said that that was \"really worrisome to people, with good reason,\" while pointing to his adminstration's efforts to tackle housing costs, junk fees and so-called \"shrinkflation.\"\n\n\"When I started this administration, people were saying there is going to be a collapse in the economy,\" Biden said. \"We have the strongest economy in the world. Let me say it again -- in the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ted_johnson@deadline.com", "name": "Ted Johnson", "type":

That is the new campaigning from the basement strategy of Team Biden.\n\nThe Biden campaign is desperately trying to turn things around for the president. There is a strong sense of Trump nostalgia among voters. They are thinking back to the Trump years and remembering that things were going well until the pandemic hit, which he had nothing to do with. Even among the lockdowns and economic woes attributed to the pandemic, the economy was beginning to recover. Then Joe Biden came into office and blew everything up.\n\nBiden cannot get through a speech without mumbling and bumbling. He loses his place on the teleprompter and tries to ad-lib, which results in disaster. The truth is that he is unable to do much more than short speeches without needing clean-up by his staff.\n\nCampaigns often blame difficulty in getting out their message on communication problems but Biden can't deliver a message. Communication clarity doesn't matter if the messenger can't articulate the message. Biden's campaign wants to hone a sharper message that he can take into the general election. His aides are taking to the airwaves to say that the plan is for Biden to deliver fewer, not more speeches. The idea is to concentrate on quality, not quantity.\n\n\"There's a strategic advantage at this point in the race to boiling down your message to the three or four most salient, compelling arguments for why President Biden should be re-elected,\" said TJ Ducklo, the Biden campaign's senior adviser for communications. \"That will often translate to the stump [speech] being whittled down to its sharpest, most dynamic form. That's what you're seeing.\"\n\nTwo words not normally associated with Joe Biden - sharp and dynamic. He is neither.\n\nLet's be clear about how Biden has been campaigning. He speaks to small groups of friendly supporters. He is courting demographics with which he is losing support, which is all of them at this point. He brought fried chicken to a black family in North Carolina (yes, really). Biden and Jill Biden brought Italian food to an Italian family to remind voters that Jill is from an Italian family or something. Biden met with locals on an elected official's front porch in one town. It's all cringeworthy.\n\nThe press is kept away from Biden. The staff is too nervous about what he may say. Can you imagine Trump's staff keeping the press away from him? He'll stand and talk to them all day long, given the opportunity.\n\nSome of Biden's advisers have been pushing for him to go even further in attempts to sharpen his public appearances. They've argued for the president to replace prepared campaign remarks entirely, in favor of less scripted retail stops and punchier, digital content where he speaks directly to the camera.\n\nThat dramatic shift hasn't happened, but aides say the idea has been discussed as the campaign tries to find ways to reach an unsettled electorate that consumes information differently than in previous cycles. Discussing the idea is also a reflection, aides say, of how much harder it is to get -- and keep -- voters' attention.\n\nBiden stops by coffee shops and ice cream shops but those visits are awkward at best. He's surprised that a smoothie costs $7 in an upscale coffee shop. Biden botched a visit to a fast-food place that his advance team had arranged for him. He decided to order a milkshake for himself at the last minute. Then he gave the cashier some cash as he said he knew his order had already been paid for, so it looked like he was tipping the bewildered cashier. Oof.\n\nOld Yeller needs to go home, go sit on the beach in Delaware, and enjoy his retirement.\n\nHe is delivering short speeches because that is all he can do.\n\nThe president has in recent weeks made notable efforts at brevity, in both official and campaign events. Biden's remarks this past week on the campus protests over the war in the Gaza Strip were just four minutes long. His high-profile speech on abortion rights in Florida last week was just 14 minutes long. And his speech at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner lasted just 10 minutes -- half as long as the year before.\n\nBiden's speeches are not as timely as they should be for a president on top of the situation. He has not fully addressed the nation on our role in the Israel-Hamas war. He should have delivered a speech that laid out his plans and what he would be doing to support Israel months ago. Instead, he has buried his head in the sand and gone wobbly in favor of making purely political decisions. He wants the votes of Muslim Arab Americans in places like Dearborn, Michigan in November. He is throwing Israel under the bus to gain those votes. It is disgraceful. It is dangerous for Israel because Biden's weakness is a green light for Hamas to continue to attack Israel.\n\nIt is reported that the campaign has not put together a speechwriting team. That is problematic for Biden because he doesn't do well in off-the-cuff remarks. He fabricates personal stories and he tries to make jokes that don't land well.\n\nTeam Biden knows that the candidate is in trouble. They aren't willing to risk doing big campaign rallies because Biden isn't up to it and he can't deliver. Maybe small events will work for him. In the meantime, he is not inspiring voters to get ready to vote for him. There is a malaise among Americans because, in Biden's America, life is not as good as it was in the Trump years. The campaign has its work cut out for it if they are to drag Biden over the finish line. For now, the election looks like Trump's to lose, even with the lawfare waged against him by the Biden administration.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"},

In Wisconsin, the poll found Trump with a 4 percentage point lead. In March, the same poll had Biden leading by 1 point.\n\nThe trip is Biden's fourth visit to Wisconsin this year -- a marker of its importance. Trump carried the state by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 and Biden flipped it in 2020, also winning it narrowly.\n\nBiden will also make a campaign stop afterward in Wisconsin, speaking to Black voters. Polls have shown warning signs for Democrats among the crucial demographic bloc.\n\nBiden has escalated his travel to battleground states in recent weeks hoping to capitalize on his opponent's legal woes. Trump has been largely sidelined with his criminal trial involving hush-money payments to an adult film star underway in Manhattan. The presumptive Republican nominee is required to be in the courtroom for the proceedings, limiting his ability to campaign on weekdays.\n\nBiden is scheduled to visit Chicago for a fundraiser later Wednesday as he looks to build up his cash advantage over Trump. Chicago will also host the Democratic National Convention this summer.", "source": {"uri": "chicagobusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crain's Chicago Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gou", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terry Gou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Wisconsin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Wisconsin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Walker_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott Walker (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.chicagobusiness.com/s3/files/styles/1024x512/s3/411299335.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547714", "eventUri": "eng-9547714", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Unless you think I'm kidding, just think back to the 6th of January,\" Biden said, referring to the deadly 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"But look, chaos is nothing new for Trump. His presidency was chaos,\" Biden continued during a 16-minute speech before nearly 80 people inside a meeting room at the Palmer House hotel in the Loop. \"Trump is trying to make the country forget about the dark and unsettling things that he did when he was president. Well, we're not going to let him forget.\"\n\nChicago, where Biden is expected to be formally renominated for president at the Democratic National Convention in August, has become a reliable ATM for Biden's presidential campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris also is set to speak at a Chicago-area fundraising event on May 16. An estimate of how much money was raised Wednesday was not immediately available. On his March 8 trip, Biden raised an estimated $2.5 million.\n\nDuring his speech Wednesday, Biden portrayed the U.S. as a nation that had moved significantly ahead from Trump's White House days when Trump attempted to dismiss the potential severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and he suggested people inject themselves with bleach.\n\n\"The bleach, he didn't inject in his body. He put it in his hair,\" Biden joked. \"I don't think anybody wants to go back to that. And I think we've just got to remember and remind people what's going on.\"\n\nBiden also lashed out at Trump's role in urging congressional Republicans to dismiss a Democratic-backed immigration reform plan to keep the potent issue alive for the November election.\n\n\"I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades. Trump says immigrants are poisoning the blood of Americans. Well, I wonder how many of us would be here if that was the case with our forefathers?\" the president asked.\n\n\"He said the biggest threat, the biggest threat, is these criminals coming across the border. Well, folks, the biggest threat is Trump and what he poses for our democracy,\" Biden said.\n\nOutside the Palmer House, a group of pro-Palestinian protesters shut down State Street at Monroe Street, using a bullhorn to assail Biden and U.S. policies supportive of Israel.\n\nThe protest, along with road closures in the Loop around the hotel for presidential security purposes, sent downtown rush-hour traffic into gridlock at many intersections.\n\nBiden made no mention of the Israel-Hamas conflict during his brief address. But in speaking to CNN before arriving in Chicago, the president said he'd told Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that U.S. shipments of some heavy weapons would be halted if the Israeli military invaded Rafah in the Gaza Strip, where more than a million Palestinians have taken refuge.\n\nBiden's fundraising effort in Chicago kicked off three days of presidential travel. Biden also will head out for a series of West Coast campaign events, including fundraising receptions in the San Francisco area on Friday and in Seattle later Friday and on Saturday.\n\nBiden's Chicago visit followed a trip to Racine County in the critical presidential swing state of Wisconsin, where he touted investment in high-tech manufacturing in a city once seen as stereotypical of a declining rust belt.\n\nAt the Gateway Technical College, Biden called Racine a \"great comeback story\" in hailing Microsoft's $3.3 billion investment to construct a new artificial intelligence datacenter that company officials said will create 2,300 union construction jobs and eventually lead to 2,000 permanent jobs.\n\nThe location of the AI facility also provided Biden a chance to criticize Trump.\n\nSome of the land for the data center is located at the same place where Trump six years ago had lauded the promise of Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn to invest $10 billion in an LCD screen production facility that would create 13,000 jobs -- with $500 million in public money used as an enticement.\n\nInstead, after homes and farms were bulldozed for the production facility, Foxconn abandoned plans for screen manufacturing at the site and few jobs were created.\n\n\"He came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the eighth wonder of the world. You kidding me?\" Biden told the crowd. \"Look what happened. They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it.\"\n\nIn contrast, Biden said, \"On my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. We leave no one behind.\"\n\nBiden's comments came as new polling showed the president was continuing to have difficulties selling his domestic policy and economic initiatives as achievements to voters.\n\nThough he pushed his theme of \"Bidenomics,\" voters still remain sensitive to inflationary costs.\n\n\"We're doing what has always worked in this country,\" he said, explaining the rationale of \"Bidenomics.\" \"Giving people a fair shot, leaving nobody behind, growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.\"", "source": {"uri":

The 'uncommitted' voters have been highlighted only because of the war in Gaza, but they may not amount to much\n\nSeveral leading American universities at present are under siege by two things: 1) Students, and 2) The shortsightedness of their managements, who have abdicated administrative responsibilities and handed them over to law enforcement. Following nationwide protests against the Israeli military offensive in Gaza that has left nearly 35,000 Palestinians dead, universities around the US allowed the police to take action against their students. In some cases, like Columbia University in New York, administrations have cancelled graduation ceremonies, locked up hostels and dorm rooms, and cancelled all classes, leaving thousands of students in the lurch.\n\nThese intense student protests led to an obvious question -- has President Joe Biden lost the youth vote? It is a legitimate question, because young voters in America have traditionally been voting for the Democratic Party (to which Biden belongs). But not only is Biden not listening to the students, he has doubled down on Washington's support to Tel Aviv by pushing for more dollars in aid.\n\nOn March 29, the Biden administration authorised the transfer of billions of dollars' worth of bombs and fighter jets to Israel. Of the $3.8 billion in military aid given to Israel this year, half a billion was for Israel's missile defence. Washington has announced that it will replenish Israel's ammunition used in the recent war against Hamas.\n\nIn April, Biden signed a $95bn security package which included around $17bn in military aid for Israel and just $1bn in humanitarian aid for Gaza.\n\nRecently, The New Yorker magazine quoted Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official, as saying, \"Do I think that Joe Biden has the same depth of feeling and empathy for the Palestinians of Gaza as he does for the Israelis? No, he doesn't.\"\n\nNot surprising then, that one of the epithets to have emerged in the middle of all this is \"Genocide Joe.\"\n\nBiden has a two-body problem for this November's election. One, he has to retain the White House not just for the Democrats but to retain the overall sanity of America and the rest of the world. Two, he has to wrest back the House of Representatives from the Republicans who have thrown spanner after spanner in Biden's path this term to get even the most basic of legislations passed. And, have threatened impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nThe option to Biden is Donald Trump, the only presidential candidate in American history to have asked a porn star to spank him with a magazine and to have participated in a gold tournament part-sponsored by a leading porn film company (if you are really interested, the company's name is Wicked Pictures). Trump's first term -- like his 2024 presidential campaign -- was characterised by bigotry, hatred, lies, misdirected policies, antagonising allies and befriending arch enemies, and generally making America the laughing stock. America needs Biden not because Biden is a great President, but to keep Trump and the ensuing chaos out.\n\nWhich brings us to the question we asked at the beginning: How much does the youth vote matter to Biden, and will it change the course of history? Potentially, it can. But in reality, it may not. Historically, America has been a low-voting country. Rarely does its presidential election voting percentage cross 60%. In the last 10 elections, Americans have broken the 60% barrier just once, in the 2020 election when Biden won comprehensively. In fact, the last time Americans crossed 60% in a presidential poll was 1968 -- 56 years ago.\n\nThe youth demographic (this includes young Jews, a contextually important sub-group) is worse. In the 18-24 age group, the voting percentage in the last seven elections is around 39%. It is abysmally low. The age groups that turn up the most to vote in the US are 45-64 and 65-plus. Both groups record over 65% in any election, and in the last where Biden won, 72% of those eligible in the 65-plus age group turned up to vote.\n\nAccording to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Biden's support for Israel is not necessarily increasing his votes among the Jewish population. His constituency, it would therefore seem, is not secular to the extent that they are willing to support him over domestic issues rather than foreign policy concerns.\n\nProf Steven Windmueller of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, Los Angeles writes: \"Historically, most American Jewish voters have been aligned with the Democratic Party. In the 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden received about 68% of the Jewish vote, while Donald Trump secured 28%. The overall national vote four years ago broke 51% to 49% in favor of President Biden... A more recent Siena College-NY Times study noted the following: Trump's support among Jews in New York is...slipping, decreasing from 53 percent in a February poll by Siena College to 38 percent in a survey conducted between April 15 and 17, 2024.\"\n\nEvidently, voting patterns in America are more complex than what the mainstream media would have us believe. The \"uncommitted\" voters have been highlighted only because of the war in Gaza, but they may not amount to much. The youth vote may not impact Biden much because they despise Trump more, and Biden becomes a fait accompli -- if they turn up, that is.\n\nWhat we are left with, therefore, are the same experienced voters (45 and above) as the 2016 and 2020 elections. Biden knows this. It is for this reason perhaps that he is not making any strong statements about law enforcement excesses in campuses.\n\nWe are exactly six months away from one of the most consequential American elections of this century. But neither candidate seems to be currently super active on the campaign trail -- President Biden is bogged down by serious administrative issues and former President Trump has to be in court every day in New York.\n\nBut if all the surrounding noise is muted, it would seem the election is actually business as usual.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free

One says former President Donald Trump is up, and another gives the nod to President Joe Biden.\n\nOne pollster thinks it has an answer: Just ask your neighbor whom he or she is planning to vote for.\n\nLike many consumers of political surveys, pollster TIPP/Insights has been angling to determine who is really leading in the dead heat race.\n\nSo, for its latest analysis, it did a deep dive into the data and found five indicators that Trump could be ahead.\n\nThe headline numbers for its latest survey found Biden with 42% national support and Trump with 40%. It described the race as \"neck and neck\" and within the margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 points.\n\nBut as it dug into other questions, it found an edge for Trump.\n\nFirst, the polling outfit looked at independent voters, who are expected to play an outsize role in the November outcome. Among independents, TIPP said Trump led 35% to 30%.\n\n\"Why is this important? Independents in the last election favored Biden 54% to Trump's 41%. That has, for all intents and purposes, been reversed this time around,\" the analysis said.\n\nNext, Biden is losing his big advantage among black and Hispanic people. \"African Americans, for instance, gave 87% of their vote to Biden in 2020, compared to just 12% for Trump. But that's changed dramatically in 2024: Black voters say they favor Biden by 59%, a 28% decline from four years ago, while 15% say they back Trump, a three percentage-point gain. All told, it's a 31-point swing,\" TIPP said.\n\n\"Among Hispanics, Biden slammed Trump in 2020, 65% to 32%. In this month's I&I/TIPP Poll, Hispanics give just 47% support to Biden, 26% to Trump, and 13% to Kennedy,\" it added.\n\nVoter support, or intensity for their choice, is also key. The gap favors Trump, 64% to 54%.\n\nThen, there is the question of who voters \"think\" will win. It's Trump again, but closer, 37% to 34%.\n\nBut the kicker, the pollster said, is in the question about who voters think their neighbor will vote for. Here, it cited a Brookings Institution report that said the neighbor vote is among the best predictors.\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\n\"We demonstrate that polls of voter expectations consistently yield more accurate forecasts than polls of voter intentions,\" Brookings said. TIPP added, \"I&I/TIPP data indicate that even voters who support Biden show a lack of enthusiasm, while most registered voters now expect Trump to win, significant since recent studies indicate such expectations have a high likelihood of becoming reality.\"\n\nOn the question of how neighbors are voting, TIPP concluded, \"The answer is revealing: 43% responded Trump, while just 31% said Biden. Another 25% said 'not sure.'\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bedard@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Paul Bedard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brookings Institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

They say that in polls. And part of the reason for that may be the numbers,\" Burnett told Biden on an OutFront interview set to air Wednesday night.\n\nBurnett then dug into the hard data showing costs rising across the board while wages have gone down.\n\n\"You're aware of many of these, of course. The cost of buying a home in the United States is double what it was when you look at your monthly costs from before the pandemic,\" she explained. \"Real income when you account for inflation is actually down since you took office.

Newsweek has reached out to the Trump and Biden campaigns via email for comment.\n\nA Data Orbital poll has found that Trump is trailing Biden in the battleground state of Arizona for the first time in six months.\n\nBiden won Wisconsin in 2020, and victory there was crucial in setting him on the path to the White House. The state was also essential to Trump's election victory in 2016 and will be hotly contested this year.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll also found that Trump and Biden were neck-and-neck when Green Party and independent candidates were included.\n\nForty percent of registered voters said they would back Biden; 39 percent supported Trump; and 12 percent expressed support for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nA further 4 percent said they would vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and 1 percent supported independent candidate Cornel West.\n\nThe poll was conducted from May 2 to 6 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percent.\n\nBiden's support in the head-to-head matchup is his biggest lead over Trump in Wisconsin in 2024 polling, according to polls aggregated since April by tracker FiveThirtyEight.\n\nAn Emerson College poll among 1,000 registered voters from April 25 to 29 showed Trump leading in Wisconsin with 52 percent to Biden's 48 percent in a two-way matchup.\n\nWhen Kennedy, Stein, and West were included, the Emerson College poll found Trump leading with 45 percent to Biden's 40 percent.\n\nA YouGov/CBS News poll conducted from April 19 to 25 among 1,226 likely voters showed Trump with 50 percent to Biden's 49 percent in a head-to-head race; a lead of just 1 percent for the former president.\n\nWhen Stein was included in the YouGov/CBS News poll, Trump led with 48 percent, Biden had 44 percent support, and Stein garnered 8 percent.\n\nThe earliest poll cited by FiveThirtyEight showed a dead heat in Wisconsin, with Biden and Trump recording 48 percent support. That poll was carried out by Beacon Research/Shaw & Company Research on behalf of Fox News and it surveyed 1,198 registered voters from April 11 to 16.\n\nThough the Quinnipiac poll may be good news for Biden, the race in Wisconsin looks set to remain very close. FiveThirtyEight's polling average gave Trump a lead of 1.5 percent over the president as of Wednesday.\n\nTrump won an upset victory in Wisconsin in 2016, carrying the state by less than 1 percent. In 2020, Biden won Wisconsin with 49.4 percent of the vote to Trump's 48.8.

(CBS 58) -- When President Joe Biden walked into a room of about 40, mostly Black, voters Wednesday afternoon, the first thing he brought up was his first campaign for U.S. Senate in 1972.\n\nThe president noted he's long relied on the support of Black voters, and his campaign is making clear those votes will once again be necessary this fall if Mr. Biden is to be reelected.\n\n\"When I run in [my home state of] Delaware -- not a joke -- I get 90% of the African-American vote,\" Mr. Biden said. \"In off-years and [presidential election] years, because you're the most loyal constituency.\"\n\nWednesday afternoon's stop at the Bryant Community Center followed the president's remarks at Gateway Technical College, where he touted Microsoft's commitment to invest $3.3 billion in a data center on Mount Pleasant property that had originally been cleared and reserved for Foxconn.\n\nThe invite-only event was part of a new push from Mr. Biden's re-election campaign to secure the votes of Black, Latino and Asian voters. Campaign officials said they're spending $14 million this month on advertising targeting those demographic groups.\n\nRecent election results in Racine County illustrate why Mr. Biden's campaign is launching a push to shore up the support of groups that have traditionally backed Democrats.\n\nRacine County had long been a bellwether state, with the candidate who won the county carrying Wisconsin in every presidential election between 2000 and 2016. That trend broke in 2020 when former President Donald Trump won the county by more than 4,300 votes despite losing Wisconsin by nearly 21,000 votes.\n\nThe only Democratic candidate to win Racine County since 2000 was former President Barack Obama, who won the county by fewer than 4,000 votes in 2012 and by nearly 7,500 votes in 2008.\n\nMr. Trump won Racine County en route to taking Wisconsin as he upset former U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump won the state by nearly 4,100 votes eight years ago.\n\nReporters were allowed to be in the room for about 15 minutes during President Biden's remarks Wednesday. After telling the story of his first Senate election, Mr. Biden quipped, \"You've got some senators I'd like to see change\" in an apparent reference to Republican Senator Ron Johnson.\n\nMr. Biden then told the audience he believed democracy was at stake in this year's election. He referred to an interview he did earlier in the day with CNN and said he was asked if he believed Mr. Trump was being serious when he would not commit to accepting the election results in an interview last week with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n\"She asked the question, whether I thought Trump- did he mean what he said when he said, basically, he's not gonna accept the results of the election,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I said he won't. He won't.\"\n\nDuring a press call with reporters earlier in the day, Wisconsin Republicans said the president's Microsoft event and renewed push to target Black, Latino and Asian voters were an effort to deflect from frustrations over the lingering effects of inflation.\n\n\"What we had previously [under former President Trump] was economic policies that was helping lift up all groups,\" Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Janesville) said. \"In particular, those groups that have found themselves historically disadvantaged.\"\n\nOutside the community center, a youth flag football team held a practice long after the president and attendees left. The coach, Daryl Carter, had the team do sprints and jumping jacks before getting into drills.\n\nWhen asked issued mattered most to him and what he wanted to see from a presidential candidate, Carter was straight to the point.\n\n\"Jobs, schools, programs for the children, Carter said. \"Cut out some of the red tape. Don't just write it on paper, be about it.\"\n\nRegarding the issues that matter most to Wisconsin voters, it's a mixed bag. Last month's Marquette Law Poll found respondents were torn over who performed best on the four issues they ranked most important: The economy, immigration, abortion, and Medicare/Social Security.\n\nVoters preferred Mr. Trump on the economy and immigration while favoring President Biden on abortion and Medicare/Social Security.\n\nOverall, Mr. Trump had a slight edge among likely Wisconsin voters, 51% to 49%. However, a Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday found Mr. Biden with a six-point lead over Mr. Trump, 50% to 44%, although the gap was just one point when putting Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on the hypothetical ballot.\n\nUltimately, the only thing that matters is turnout this fall, and that explains why both candidates have come to Wisconsin over the past seven days. Mr. Trump held a rally Waukesha last week after visiting Green Bay in early April.\n\nWednesday's visit marked President Biden's fourth trip to Wisconsin this year, and Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to make her fourth visit to the Badger State with a stop in Milwaukee next Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "cbs58.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS58"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racine_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racine County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Racine County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Technical_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gateway Technical College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDJT-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WDJT-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellwether", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bellwether"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Journal_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Steil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Steil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinnipiac_University_Polling_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinnipiac University Polling Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Some plan to avoid voting entirely, unimpressed by both Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe voter turnout under age 30 has increased in recent presidential elections. The 2020 and 2018 elections each logged \"unusually high turnout\" among young voters, said estimates from the University of Florida's Michael McDonald cited by The Washington Post. Youth participation was record-breaking in 2020, even higher than in the 2008 election, which Barack Obama won after securing 66% of the under-30 vote. But a fall 2023 poll released by the Harvard Kennedy School indicated that young Americans are less likely to vote in 2024. \"At this point in the 2020 election cycle, 57% of Americans between ages 18 and 29 were planning to vote; that number has since declined to 49%,\" said Teen Vogue.\n\nThough Gen Z voters generally prefer Biden over Trump, younger generations are also distancing themselves from the president. \"Poll after poll\" suggests a huge shift in the electorate, said Politico: \"Biden is struggling with young voters but performing better than most Democrats with older ones.\" This is a reversal, as Democratic candidates typically win the youth vote while Republicans lead with seniors. The polls may be wrong -- they did underestimate Trump in the last two elections. But \"if these changes are real, it would have profound effects on the coalitions both campaigns are building,\" Politico added. Biden still leads Trump in voters ages 18 to 29, but that margin is much smaller than it was four years ago; and if Trump's young voters are fewer than Biden's, they are also more enthusiastic.\n\nWhy are young people so disgruntled? To begin with, many do not support Israel's war in Gaza. A letter signed by leaders of youth organization-focused groups in November 2023 warned that the Biden administration's position on Israel \"risks millions of young voters staying home or voting third party,\" said NBC News. Since October, over 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces (about 72% of them women and children, according to Gaza's Government Media Office). Thousands of college students protested the war in the last week, outraged over the United States' continued support of Israel. Separately, Biden recently signed a law that would ban the popular social media app TikTok. If youth protests are swarmed with police and TikTok is gone, where can young people speak out? At the polls, it seems -- or, quite possibly, not at them.\n\n\"Young voters are stuck in a political Groundhog Day -- and many are disillusioned by the lack of choice or younger candidates who reflect their views,\" said Erica Pandey at Axios. The problem is not just this year's presidential candidates, but fatigue on a grander scale. \"Confidence in the nation's institutions has plummeted among younger Americans over the last two election cycles,\" said The Harvard Gazette.\n\nIt's no surprise that backing for Biden has waned. \"He was never young people's preferred candidate in the 2020 primaries; young Americans were reluctant to support him; and though 2020 saw a record number of young people turn out, they still tended to be voting against Trump, rather than for Biden, in the general election,\" said Christian Paz, a political reporter at Vox. In addition to their disapproval of funding Israel's war on Gaza, young people consider Biden not \"progressive enough\" on issues like inflation, health care and abortion access.\n\n\"The real threat to Biden is that younger voters, especially college-educated voters, won't turn out for him in the election,\" Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, said to The Guardian. \"I wouldn't expect that the protesters on campuses today are going to vote for Trump ... The danger is much simpler: that they simply won't vote.\"\n\nPolls show Biden and Trump neck and neck in several key swing states, so youth turnout could have a real impact. Young people seem to realize Biden's reelection depends on their support, but are waiting and hoping for his campaign to address their concerns more directly. Biden could call for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza -- which young Americans support by a five-to-one ratio, said a recent Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll. Biden could also alter his campaign strategy to focus more forcefully on issues that are important to young generations, such as climate accomplishments.", "source": {"uri": "theweek.com", "dataType":

Not long after, the Republican headlined a \"groundbreaking\" event on the site -- Trump even held a shovel painted gold -- claiming that the high-tech venue would be the \"eighth wonder of the world.\"\n\nIt was not.

While this lead is incredibly small and within the poll's margin error, it represents the first time Biden has taken the lead in an Arizona state poll since November, according to analysis by polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight.\n\nFor instance, an April Echelon Insights survey of 2,401 registered voters, conducted for the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, showed that Trump was ahead of Biden in Arizona by 51 percent to 45 percent.\n\nIn March, the former president and the incumbent won enough primary races to secure, respectively, the Republican and Democratic nominations in the 2024 presidential election. Polls have so far shown that the results will be tight as the pair are statistically tied in most surveys or enjoying only marginal leads.\n\nArizona has historically leaned towards Republicans, but it backed Biden in 2020 and the Democratic party in several statewide races in 2022. It's expected to be a close race in November.\n\nBattleground states like Arizona may determine the result of the election, so surveys from them are arguably more important than national polls.\n\nHowever, many experts and academics have cautioned against relying on polls to try to predict the outcome of the election rematch. Thomas Gift, who heads the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, previously told Newsweek that reading too much into polls was \"a fool's errand.\"\n\n\"Polls are so variable at this point that the only consistent insight we can glean from them is that Biden and Trump are neck and neck -- not only nationally but in key swing states,\" he said.\n\nNewsweek contacted representatives for Trump and Biden by email to comment on this story.\n\nIn response, Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign spokesperson, sent Newsweek links to a series of Arizona polls from February to April in which Trump led Biden in the state.\n\nData Orbital's poll was conducted from April 27 to April 29.

And despite U.S. troops not directly engaging in either conflict, the political impact is being seen.\n\nThe Biden administration had been pushing congressional Republicans to approve additional financial support for Ukraine in its war with Russia for months before the aid package passed last month.\n\nAt the same time, Biden has been navigating a tricky situation with the war in the Middle East, which has exacerbated tensions within his coalition from 2020. Protests have popped up on college campuses in recent weeks in opposition to continued financial aid for Israel.\n\nCritics have also organized an effort to vote \"uncommitted\" as a protest against Biden in the Democratic primaries.\n\nSo far, both these conflicts have not pulled the U.S. in directly. But if they were to spill over -- if Russia were to attack a NATO country, for example, or Iran were to get more involved in the Israel-Hamas war -- direct military involvement may be deemed necessary.\n\nThat kind of development could boost or set back Biden's campaign, depending on the public's view of the conflict.\n\nRFK Jr. or other third-party candidates gain more traction\n\nDespite the third-party candidates in the race mostly polling in the single digits, both major parties have recently gone on offense against independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has at times polled just above 10 percent.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has formed a team to address third-party and independent candidates running this year. Trump has also recently turned his attention to Kennedy, calling him a \"Democratic plant\" and \"not a serious candidate.\"\n\nEven with Kennedy sometimes cracking double digits, he would still need to improve to potentially make the debate stage in the fall. If he does, the first three-person general election debate in three decades could add another element of unpredictability.\n\nIn addition to Kennedy, Cornel West is running as an independent, and Jill Stein appears likely to be the Green Party nominee again. Still, both are receiving no more than 1 or 2 percent support in the polls currently.\n\nA surge for one or more of these candidates could change the outlook for the race. While they're all long shots for the presidency, a rise from any could yield uncertain results.\n\nEconomy experiences a downturn or recession\n\nThe economy is often a key campaign issue in presidential elections, and polls have shown the topic to be a top concern for voters this year.\n\nAlthough unemployment has consistently remained at a historically low rate -- under 4 percent -- polls show many Americans are pessimistic, especially in light of lingering inflation that has dropped significantly in the past year but remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent.\n\nBiden has sought to balance emphasizing his administration's success in maintaining low unemployment with recognizing the continued higher prices raising the cost of living. While the economy remains stable, that could be a viable strategy.\n\nBut if an economic downturn or a recession were to happen, Biden would be in a considerably tougher spot to try to convince Americans of his economic message. On the other hand, a drop in inflation allowing the Fed to lower interest rates for the first time in months could spark the optimism that the president needs.\n\nTrump is convicted or acquitted in New York case\n\nThe twist that is most expected to come -- as soon as a few weeks from now -- is the return of a verdict in the first criminal trial of a former president.\n\nTrump's trial over alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels has been ongoing for a few weeks and could wrap up before the summer starts. The trial may be the only one of the four cases Trump is facing that takes place before Election Day.\n\nIf Trump is found not guilty, he will likely declare victory and it proves the charges were politically motivated, as he has claimed.\n\nIf Trump is convicted, it would be unprecedented, but the impacts are unclear. Polling has been mixed on whether a conviction in this case would notably hurt Trump.\n\nOne poll found 57 percent of those surveyed consider the hush money charges to be serious, and the same amount say Trump shouldn't be president if convicted of a serious crime. Another poll found that those who said a conviction would make them reconsider support for Trump overwhelmingly would not vote for Biden.\n\nBut even a small change one way or another could make the difference.", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTAJ - www.wtaj.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_gans@wtaj.com", "name": "Jared Gans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Donald Trump could lose the Keystone State and cobble together a few plausible paths 270, though claiming that prize could guarantee his victory. In 2016, Trump carried Pennsylvania over Hillary Clinton by less than one percentage point. Four years later, Biden eked out a close win by just over one percentage point. Another very close contest is expected. As Rebecca covered earlier in the week, a fresh survey of this crucial battleground -- commissioned by the left-leaning advocacy group AARP -- found the 45th president leading the 46th president in their looming rematch by four points, head-to-head. Within a wider field, the margin expands slightly to five points:\n\nTrump is up 10 points among independents here. The survey also shows the GOP ahead slightly in the state's 'generic ballot,' though incumbent Senator Bob Casey, a Biden rubber-stamp Democrat, maintains a modest lead over Republican challenger Dave McCormick. This poll's top-line results are strikingly similar to another Keystone State data set published this week by Muhlenberg College:\n\nTrump has a three point lead against Biden in a straight-up matchup, but when Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is added to the mix as an independent, the two major party nominees are tied. In the AARP poll, RFK wasn't included. This suggests that the prominent third-party candidate's presence may benefit Biden in Pennsylvania, if he can get on the ballot. In other states (see below, for instance), RFK appears to boost Trump. To hammer away at the electoral dynamic I can't stop writing and talking about, this latter survey found the former president ahead by two points among those who say they are \"definitely voting\" this year. Among those who are \"not likely\" to vote, Trump's lead is 11 points. All the numbers show that there's a sizable reservoir of would-be Trump supporters who are either unreliable voters, or who aren't yet registered to vote. How many of them do or do not participate in the election could be the difference between a Trump win and a bigger Trump win -- or they could be the deciding factor between a Trump win and a Trump loss.\n\nThe Democrats and the Biden campaign are deadly serious about their ballot-chasing turnout operation. Republicans and Team Trump seem to be lagging considerably behind in this imperative-to-decisive realm. Meanwhile, Quinnipiac has released a new poll in the swing state of Wisconsin, which looks like good news for the incumbent:\n\nThis survey shows a six-point Biden lead collapsing down to a neck-and-neck virtual tie when RFK and others are included on the ballot, indicating that unlike in Pennsylvania, Trump may be rooting for the independent candidate with a famous last name to gain ballot access. Then again, I take all Quinnipiac numbers with a chunk of salt because that pollster has been, to be quite frank, horrendous for multiple cycles -- especially, but not exclusively, at the state level. To wit:\n\nYikes.

And even if American troops do not engage directly in either conflict, the political impact is visible.\n\nThe Biden administration had been pushing congressional Republicans to approve additional financial support for Ukraine in its war against Russia for months before the aid package passed last month.\n\nAt the same time, Biden faces a delicate situation with the war in the Middle East, which has heightened tensions within his coalition starting in 2020. Protests have erupted on college campuses in recent weeks to oppose to maintain financial aid to Israel.\n\nCritics also organized an effort to vote \"no strings attached\" as a protest against Biden in the Democratic primaries.\n\nSo far, these two conflicts have not directly involved the United States. But if they were to spill over - if Russia were to attack a NATO country, for example, or if Iran were to become more involved in the war between Israel and Hamas - direct military participation might be deemed necessary.\n\nThese kinds of developments could boost or hinder Biden's campaign, depending on the public's view of the conflict.\n\nRFK Jr. or other third-party candidates are gaining ground\n\nAlthough third-party candidates in the race have mostly polled in the single digits, both major parties have recently taken the offensive against independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has at times scored just over 10%. hundred.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has formed a team to reach out to third-party and independent candidates running this year. Trump also recently turned his attention to Kennedy, calling him a \"Democratic plant\" and an \"unserious candidate.\"\n\nEven if Kennedy hits double digits at times, he would still need to improve to potentially enter the debate in the fall. If he does, the first three-way general election debate in three decades could add another element of unpredictability.\n\nIn addition to Kennedy, Cornel West is running as an independent and Jill Stein appears to be the Green Party candidate again. Yet both currently receive no more than 1 or 2 percent support in polls.\n\nA rise of one or more of these candidates could change the outlook of the race. Although they are all far from presidential candidates, a rise by any one could yield uncertain results.\n\nThe economy is experiencing a slowdown or recession\n\nThe economy is often a key theme in the presidential election campaign, and polls have shown the issue to be a top concern among voters this year.\n\nEven though the unemployment rate has remained consistently at a historically low rate - below 4 percent - polls show that many Americans are pessimistic, especially in light of persistent inflation that has declined significantly over the past year. last year but remains above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.\n\nBiden has sought to balance a focus on his administration's success in keeping unemployment low while acknowledging continued price increases that are driving up the cost of living. As long as the economy remains stable, this could be a viable strategy.\n\nBut if an economic downturn or recession were to occur, Biden would find himself in a much more difficult situation trying to convince Americans of his economic message. On the other hand, falling inflation allowing the Fed to cut interest rates for the first time in months could provide the optimism the president needs.\n\nTrump found guilty or acquitted in New York case\n\nThe most anticipated development - within a few weeks - is the verdict in the first criminal trial of a former president.\n\nTrump's trial over alleged secret payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels has been ongoing for several weeks and could conclude before the start of summer. The trial may be the only one of the four cases Trump faces that takes place before Election Day.\n\nIf Trump is found not guilty, he will likely declare victory and that will prove that the charges were politically motivated, as he has claimed.\n\nIf Trump were convicted, it would be an unprecedented situation, but the consequences are unclear. Polls are mixed on whether a conviction in the case would particularly harm Trump.\n\nA poll finds that 57 percent of respondents consider the hush money accusations to be serious, and the same number say Trump should not be president if he is convicted of a serious crime. Another poll found that those who thought a conviction would cause them to reconsider their support for Trump would not overwhelmingly vote for Biden.\n\nBut even a small change, one way or another, could make a difference.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

It always depends on the fairness of an election.\"\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nDoyle McManus is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" he later told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\nWhen Trump says \"it depends,\" here's the problem: He has never competed in an election that he acknowledged as fair.\n\nEven when he won the presidential election of 2016, he claimed that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats rigged the count to deny him a popular-vote landslide, contending without evidence that millions of noncitizens had voted in California. The official inquiry he ordered up found no significant irregularities.\n\nIn 2020, when he lost to President Biden by 7 million votes, Trump not only claimed the result was illegitimate; he worked for months to overturn it, demanding that state officials \"find\" thousands of new votes in his favor. When his court challenges failed, he summoned supporters to Washington and urged them to march on the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you don't fight like hell, you won't have a country any more,\" he told them. The mob responded by invading the building.\n\nHe returned to that apocalyptic theme last week, when he told supporters in Wisconsin that if Biden wins a second term, \"we won't have a country left.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is destroying our country,\" Trump said at a rally. \"The enemy from within is more dangerous than China and Russia. ... I actually think our country is not going to survive.\"\n\nIt was as if he was priming his followers for extreme measures if he doesn't prevail.\n\nAnd it was part of a long pattern. In January, he warned that if his four criminal indictments prevent him from winning, the result will be \"bedlam in the country.\"\n\n\"It's the opening of a Pandora's box,\" he warned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, he posted a video on his social media account showing an image of Biden hog-tied like a prisoner.\n\nAnd for months he has extolled the defendants convicted of violent crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection as \"hostages,\" promising to pardon many or all if he is reelected.\n\n\"He's telling us what his intentions are, as he did before Jan. 6,\" Juliette Kayyem, a terrorism expert at Harvard University, said recently on PBS. \"The language is the language of incitement. ... If he loses, we certainly know from what Trump has said -- and we also know from what the FBI is telling us -- that there are large groups and organizations that are preparing to continue the fight.\"\n\nAs matters stand in the presidential campaign, that kind of 2020-style crisis may not recur, since Trump stands a good chance of winning.\n\nThe average of public opinion polls published by fivethirtyeight.com shows a dead heat in the national popular vote -- but it shows Trump winning in all six of the most important swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump used a day off from his New York criminal trial Wednesday to campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, where he returned to his warnings about an unfair election process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The radical-left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020,\" he claimed untruthfully yet again. \"We're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. We won't have a country left ... 2024 is our final battle.\"\n\nFor months, Biden has sought to remind voters that Trump, if reelected, would run roughshod over the norms of American government and politics.\n\n\"Democracy is on the ballot,\" the president often says.\n\nBy reminding voters that he doesn't accept the duty to recognize the result of an election he loses, Trump has paradoxically bolstered Biden's case.\n\nFor some voters, this election may come down to a choice between preserving democracy and hoping for a return of the low inflation of the Trump years. They may not find it an easy choice.\n\nA survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 38% of Americans believe the country needs \"a leader who is willing to break some rules if that's what it takes to set things right.\" That substantial minority included 48% of Republicans.\n\nWhen Time's reporter asked Trump whether his rhetoric about overriding the Constitution and ruling as a \"dictator for a day\" might alienate voters, the former president disagreed.\n\n\"I think a lot of people like it,\" he said.\n\nUnfortunately, he's right.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Unless you think I'm kidding, just think back to the 6th of January,\" Biden said, referring to the deadly 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"But look, chaos is nothing new for Trump. His presidency was chaos,\" Biden continued during a 16-minute speech before nearly 80 people inside a meeting room at the Palmer House hotel in the Loop. \"Trump is trying to make the country forget about the dark and unsettling things that he did when he was president. Well, we're not going to let him forget.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

WJBC mourns loss of former radio host Scott Laughlin\n\nChicago, where Biden is expected to be formally renominated for president at the Democratic National Convention in August, has become a reliable ATM for Biden's presidential campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris also is set to speak at a Chicago-area fundraising event on May 16. An estimate of how much money was raised Wednesday was not immediately available. On his March 8 trip, Biden raised an estimated $2.5 million.\n\nDuring his speech Wednesday, Biden portrayed the U.S. as a nation that had moved significantly ahead from Trump's White House days when Trump attempted to dismiss the potential severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and he suggested people inject themselves with bleach.\n\n\"The bleach, he didn't inject in his body. He put it in his hair,\" Biden joked. \"I don't think anybody wants to go back to that. And I think we've just got to remember and remind people what's going on.\"\n\nBiden also lashed out at Trump's role in urging congressional Republicans to dismiss a Democratic-backed immigration reform plan to keep the potent issue alive for the November election.\n\n\"I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades. Trump says immigrants are poisoning the blood of Americans. Well, I wonder how many of us would be here if that was the case with our forefathers?\" the president asked.\n\n\"He said the biggest threat, the biggest threat, is these criminals coming across the border. Well, folks, the biggest threat is Trump and what he poses for our democracy,\" Biden said.\n\nOutside the Palmer House, a group of pro-Palestinian protesters shut down State Street at Monroe Street, using a bullhorn to assail Biden and U.S. policies supportive of Israel.\n\nThe protest, along with road closures in the Loop around the hotel for presidential security purposes, sent downtown rush-hour traffic into gridlock at many intersections.\n\nBiden made no mention of the Israel-Hamas conflict during his brief address. But in speaking to CNN before arriving in Chicago, the president said he'd told Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that U.S. shipments of some heavy weapons would be halted if the Israeli military invaded Rafah in the Gaza Strip, where more than a million Palestinians have taken refuge.\n\nBiden's fundraising effort in Chicago kicked off three days of presidential travel. Biden also will head out for a series of West Coast campaign events, including fundraising receptions in the San Francisco area on Friday and in Seattle later Friday and on Saturday.\n\nBiden's Chicago visit followed a trip to Racine County in the critical presidential swing state of Wisconsin, where he touted investment in high-tech manufacturing in a city once seen as stereotypical of a declining rust belt.\n\nAt the Gateway Technical College, Biden called Racine a \"great comeback story\" in hailing Microsoft's $3.3 billion investment to construct a new artificial intelligence datacenter that company officials said will create 2,300 union construction jobs and eventually lead to 2,000 permanent jobs.\n\nThe location of the AI facility also provided Biden a chance to criticize Trump.\n\nSome of the land for the data center is located at the same place where Trump six years ago had lauded the promise of Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn to invest $10 billion in an LCD screen production facility that would create 13,000 jobs -- with $500 million in public money used as an enticement.\n\nInstead, after homes and farms were bulldozed for the production facility, Foxconn abandoned plans for screen manufacturing at the site and few jobs were created.\n\n\"He came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the eighth wonder of the world. You kidding me?\" Biden told the crowd. \"Look what happened. They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it.\"\n\nIn contrast, Biden said, \"On my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. We leave no one behind.\"\n\nBiden's comments came as new polling showed the president was continuing to have difficulties selling his domestic policy and economic initiatives as achievements to voters.\n\nThough he pushed his theme of \"Bidenomics,\" voters still remain sensitive to inflationary costs.\n\n\"We're doing what has always worked in this country,\" he said, explaining the rationale of \"Bidenomics.\" \"Giving people a fair shot, leaving nobody behind, growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.\"\n\nPhotos: Pritzker Military Archives

Here's why they were reinstated", "body": "An advertisement for the Donald Trump reelection campaign that was aimed at Black voters in Middle Georgia was removed by Google last week and then reinstated, the company confirmed to The Telegraph.\n\nA political action committee helping Trump has begun buying digital microtargeted ads that appear on YouTube and elsewhere, an election data group found. They say Trump-related accounts have spent $304,000 to $353,500 nationwide this year.\n\nThe Middle Georgia ad created a firestorm of comments on social media, even drawing a communication from the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who claimed \"Google is censoring this pro-Trump ad to protect (President Joe) Biden.\" Trump Jr. even asked his followers on X, formerly known as Twitter, to help him make the ad go viral.\n\nGoogle says it made a mistake. \"This enforcement decision was made in error,\" a Google spokesman told The Telegraph, and \"it was appealed by the advertiser and quickly overturned upon further review. This ad is currently running.\"\n\nThe ad features a Biden campaign worker on the phone with a man who voted for Biden in 2020. The voter says \"everything costs more\" since Biden took office, including rent. The worker then says Biden is helping pay rent for \"newcomers.\"\n\n\"You mean illegal immigrants?\" the voter says. \"I'm struggling to pay my bills, but Biden's paying rent for illegals? They get handouts, and I'm paying for it. Things were better before Biden. I'm voting for Trump.\"\n\nMake America Great Again, Trump's super PAC, spent about $15,000 on the ads and ran them starting April 25 in specific communities near Macon, according to social media posts from Andrew Arenge, director of operations for the University of Pennsylvania's program on opinion research and election studies. Arenge keeps data on how much Trump and Biden have spent on digital ads.\n\nArenge made multiple X postings this weekend about how the ads were pulled and then apparently reinstated.\n\nAt least two conservative news sources were quick to write about the Middle Georgia ads being temporarily stopped, with one, the Tampa Free Press, saying \"Big Tech is already seeking to help President Biden, who is failing and flailing, stay in office.\"\n\nBiden narrowly won Georgia by a margin of 0.23% and 11,779 votes in 2020. The Trump campaign has talked openly in recent weeks about its desire to attract more Black voters by flipping Democratic constituencies.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macon,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macon, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Macon, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/macon_telegraph_mcclatchy_articles_892/a4e923822c878c7686d25bf34c2717bb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547714", "eventUri": "eng-9547714", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1567, "textEnd": 1575}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Kennedy's Peace Corps inspired their grandparents.\n\nBiden took a selfie with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New York Democrat, to remind voters that he was the first president to truly embrace elements of her Green New Deal, signing a signature $369-billion spending package in 2022 -- the biggest climate bill in American history -- to ignite the renewable energy revolution.\n\nBut Biden isn't reaping the political benefits. His lead over former President Trump among voters younger than 30 is down since 2020 -- when he won that group by 24 percentage points.\n\nHis current lead among those younger voters is somewhere between the single digits and high teens, according to a variety of polls. The Harvard Youth Poll conducted in March found Biden leading by a 19-point margin but found Trump voters (76%) were far more likely to say they were enthusiastic than Biden voters (44%).\n\nAnd even on the issue of climate, Biden and Trump are statistically tied among voters younger than 30, according to an April CBS poll.\n\nMany young voters don't know much about Biden's climate record, and many of the activists who helped fuel his 2020 victory are angry with his approval of a high-profile drilling project in Alaska and his response to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Climate, of course, is one of the most, if not the most, important issues. But because there's such extreme attention being paid to other issues, it's maybe getting a little bit less attention,\" said Isabel Hiserodt, a 20-year-old senior at Arizona State University.\n\nThough Hiserodt is president of the campus chapter of Young Democrats in a top battleground state, she said she is personally more concerned with abortion access, which is likely to be on a statewide ballot, and Gaza, where she is critical of Biden's approach. Her choice of Biden is \"not necessarily the happiest vote.\"\n\nAn undecided voter in the process of moving from Arizona to Colorado, 25-year-old Ryan Williams, said he has heard only a little about Biden's climate agenda but is thinking more intently about the two candidates' economic policies, the biggest issue for all age groups, according to polls. Climate change ranked 12th among the list of 16 issues in the Harvard poll, which found young voters were most concerned with inflation, healthcare and housing.\n\nIt's \"hard to say\" how much climate will affect his vote because there are \"a lot of different things happening in my life that take priority over researching what's happening in the government,\" Williams said, an aerospace engineer who voted for Trump in 2016 and for Biden in 2020.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green New Deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peace Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He calls supporters jailed for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol \"hostages\" and campaigns using increasingly dystopian rhetoric, refusing to rule out possible violence around the Nov. 5 contest.\n\nTrump, 77, faces 88 charges in four criminal cases over efforts to subvert the 2020 election, retaining classified documents after leaving office and alleged efforts to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star.\n\nHe denies wrongdoing in all the cases, including the criminal trial over the hush money payment that began in New York on April 15, which could be the only one of the four to go before a jury ahead of the Nov. 5 election.\n\nHe has called the criminal charges a Democratic conspiracy designed to keep him from winning, with some of his legal challenges reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Justice Department denies any political interference. If elected to another four-year term, Trump has vowed revenge on his political enemies and said he would not be a dictator except \"on day one,\" later calling that \"a joke.\" He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists. He has suggested he may not accept the election results were he to lose in November. Trump sparked criticism from Western leaders for saying the U.S. would not defend NATO members that failed to spend enough on defense and would encourage Russia to attack them. He also pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course. Trump has made immigration his top domestic campaign issue, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, create holding camps, utilize the National Guard and possibly federal troops, end birthright citizenship, and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries. He has referred to migrants as \"animals\" and has not ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil. On abortion, Trump takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, and in April said abortion should remain a state issue. While he has criticized some Republican-led state actions such as Florida's six-week abortion ban, he said he would allow Republican-led states to track women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate their state bans.\n\nHe has promised sweeping changes that included eliminating Obamacare health insurance before saying in an April 11 video that he would not \"terminate\" it. He has also vowed to undo much of the Biden administration's work to fight climate change. Trump has yet to announce a vice presidential running mate, but several possibilities have been floated. Mike Pence, who ran alongside Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was targeted by Trump and his supporters amid the Jan. 6 attack, refused to endorse him in November's contest.\n\nJOE BIDEN: Biden launched his 2020 candidacy as an urgent bid to defend American liberties and protect democracy and has cast his reelection bid in the same light, saying Trump threatens the future of American democracy.\n\nBiden faced no serious challenger for the party's nomination, which he clinched in March. November's election will be much tougher, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll putting Biden's voter support slightly ahead at 40% of registered voters, 1 percentage point ahead of Trump's 39%. Biden, already the oldest U.S. president ever at 81, must convince voters he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just four years younger, while combating low approval ratings.\n\nThe economy will also factor in Biden's reelection campaign. While the U.S. escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation and the cost of essentials are weighing on voters. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost U.S. industrial output, but has received little recognition from voters so far as his campaign moves to highlight new semiconductor manufacturing plants, housing plans and other economic efforts. Biden's handling of immigration policy has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border hit record highs.\n\nHe has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv. Biden has provided military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas in Gaza while pushing for more humanitarian assistance, but he has faced sharp criticism from some Democrats for not pushing harder for a ceasefire or matching his tougher rhetoric on Israel with action. He has said he will withhold weapons from Israel if it invades Rafah.\n\nIntensifying U.S. student protests over the war in Gaza also could weigh on his reelection bid, with some organizers behind the \"uncommitted\" movement siphoning some support from Biden in the primaries now seeking to join up with campus protesters. Biden secured additional funding for both Ukraine and Israel in April after a months-long battle with congressional Republicans.\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Best-selling author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, 71, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid focusing on \"justice and love\" less than one month after dropping out.\n\nIn a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump's \"dark and authoritarian vision\" after earlier suspending it because she was losing \"the horse race.\"\n\nWilliamson previously ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out of that race before any votes were cast.\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist and environmental advocate, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination. While he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 8% of registered voters, a seven-percentage-point drop from March. The son of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid, Kennedy has drawn rebukes from his famous family, which has publicly backed Biden. Kennedy, who chose wealthy lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, supports Israel and has questioned a six-week ceasefire backed by Biden.\n\nHe said he views the U.S. southern border situation as a humanitarian crisis and opposes Trump's border wall. He has also vowed to repeal parts of Biden's climate bill over tax breaks he says help the oil industry. Kennedy has taken different positions on abortion rights, including restrictions on when a woman can access an abortion. He told Reuters he thought every abortion was a \"tragedy\" but that it should be a woman's right \"throughout the pregnancy.\" He has been criticized for making false medical claims over the years on vaccines but says he would still allow Americans to have access to them. He himself had a brain worm more than a decade ago but has fully recovered, his campaign said in May.\n\nKennedy is officially on the ballot in a handful of states so far, including California, Michigan and Utah, and faces a challenging and costly battle to be listed in all 50.\n\nCORNEL WEST\n\nThe political activist, philosopher and academic is making a third-party bid for president that is most likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but, in October, he said people \"want good policies over partisan politics\" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.\n\nJILL STEIN\n\nJill Stein, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is trying once again in 2024.\n\nShe launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \"for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don't even make such promises in the first place.\"\n\nStein, 73, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory.

Parties surrounding Saturday night's White House Correspondents' Association Dinner have made April a high point of the Washington social calendar.\n\nWASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden didn't waste time.\n\nJust minutes into his speech at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner Saturday, Biden launched into the issues dominating the 2024 election, including his age and former President Donald Trump's hush-money trial in New York.\n\n\"The 2024 election's in full swing and yes, age is an issue,\" Biden said in a roughly 10-minute speech. \"I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.\"\n\n\"Donald has had a few tough days lately. You might call it 'stormy' weather,\" Biden said, an oblique reference to Stormy Daniels, a porn actor who claims to have had sex with Trump in 2006 and received a hush-money payment in the days before the 2016 election, a deal at the center of his New York trial.\n\nThe comments, even as part of a roast, were notable given Biden has forbidden his aides from talking publicly about Trump's legal troubles. But they also came as Biden has ramped up his attacks on Trump, sharpening the split-screen between a president on the campaign trail and a former president spending his days in a courtroom.\n\nThe annual dinner at the Washington Hilton Hotel provided a break to journalists and government officials from their normal jousting for a night of glitz and gossip in celebration of the free press. Biden, who has held fewer news conferences than his predecessors, extended his roast to the journalists gathered for the dinner.\n\n\"Some of you complained that I don't take enough of your questions,\" Biden said. \"No comment.\"\n\n\"The New York Times issued a statement blasting me for 'actively and effectively avoiding independent journalists,'\" Biden said. \"Hey, if that's what it takes to get The New York Times to say I'm active and effective, I'm for it.\"\n\nOutside the gates of the Washington Hilton, however, outrage over Biden's support for Israel's war in the Gaza Strip was evident.\n\nAs journalists and politicians arrived at the hotel, many were swarmed by pro-Palestinian protesters chanting, \"Shame on you!\" Other protesters wearing press vests with the names of more than 100 Palestinian journalists who have been killed in Gaza lay down in front of the dinner venue.\n\n\"By putting our human bodies on the street, we create a little discomfort\" for the journalists attending the event, said Hazami Barmada, an organizer of the protest.\n\nInside the hotel ballroom, many journalists wore pins reading \"Free Evan\" to raise awareness of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in Russia since March 2023 -- wrongfully, according to the U.S. government.\n\nKelly O'Donnell, a senior White House reporter for NBC News who is also president of the correspondents' association, used her remarks to call attention to journalists who have been captured or killed while doing their jobs, including Gershkovich; Austin Tice, who was kidnapped while reporting in Syria; and reporters who have been killed in Gaza.\n\n\"Our profession can be perilous,\" O'Donnell said. \"Since October, about 100 journalists have been killed, most of those deaths in Gaza.\"\n\nO'Donnell also said the association had wanted to choose both a writer and a comedian when it came to their host this year. Colin Jost, the co-anchor of \"Weekend Update\" on \"Saturday Night Live\" -- and a former reporter for the Staten Island Advance -- spent roughly 23 minutes poking fun at the president.\n\nBut Jost's speech was relatively light, even supportive of Biden. He ended it by noting that his grandfather, who recently died, had voted for Biden in the last election.\n\n\"The reason he voted for you is because you're a decent man,\" Jost said.\n\nStill, Jost didn't miss an opportunity to needle the president over his poll numbers.\n\n\"My 'Weekend Update' co-anchor, Michael Che, was going to join me here tonight -- but in solidarity with President Biden I decided to lose all my Black support,\" Jost said, referring to polling that has shown Biden struggling with Black voters.\n\nOver seared petit filet mignon, celebrities and journalists also had a chance to catch those setting policy that will impact Americans for years to come. Lester Holt, the anchor of NBC News, sat next to Jeffrey Zients, the White House chief of staff, who made sure to stand up and speak briefly with the Rev. Al Sharpton.\n\nNot everyone was in a tuxedo or dress -- Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., showed up wearing a white, hooded sweatshirt emblazoned with a bow-tie design on its front.\n\nHollywood was well represented at the dinner, with actress Scarlett Johansson, who is married to Jost, sitting up front. Popular cable news anchors dined with actors Jon Hamm and Sean Penn, among others.\n\nBefore making their way to their seats, politicians like Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, and Gov. J.B. Pritkzer of Chicago held court with guests as Biden campaign officials talked about recent polls showing Biden cutting into Trump's lead.\n\nBiden, too, sounded emboldened. While he rarely mentioned Trump by name early in his presidency, he has aggressively taunted him as of late and kept it going Saturday.\n\n\"Did you hear what Donald said about the major Civil War battle?\" Biden said. \"Gettysburg. Wow. Trump's speech was so embarrassing, the statue of Robert E. Lee surrendered again.\"\n\n\"Age is the only thing we have in common,\" Biden, 81, said of Trump, 77. \"My vice president actually endorses me,\" Biden said, referring to former Vice President Mike Pence's decision not to endorse Trump.\n\nBiden also used his speech at the dinner to warn about his political opponent's threats on democracy -- increasingly a focus of his message to voters.\n\n\"Focus on what's actually at stake,\" Biden said. \"The stakes couldn't be higher.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"},

I think he was trying to say he wasn't a \"democrat\" meaning he didn't believe in \"democracy.\"\n\nBut indeed, it's Biden and the Democrats who fail to understand the basic principles of our Constitutional Republic.

He trailed Biden by 12 points among people of color (45-33%).\n\nNeither of the main presidential candidates can say that they are viewed favorably. Only 36% of those surveyed view Biden in a favorable light with his unfavorables coming in at 57%. The good news for the 46th president is that the -21 net is two points higher than Muhlenberg's December survey (36-57%).\n\nTrump's numbers are also up, rising from a net -23 to a net -16. Thirty-nine percent of respondents view the 45th president favorably, while 55% view him differently.\n\nBiden's approval rating ticked up slightly to 35 percent from 34% during the last survey. But even though more than one-third approve of his performance, just 33% say he deserved reelection.\n\nIn our average of 18 polls since the start of the calendar year, Trump has the slightest of leads by just 0.2 percentage points over Biden, helped in part by a 2.2-point advantage in the average of the most recent five polls (47.7-45.5%).\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nCasey's numbers were above the 50 percent mark with voters of color (55%), those with a college degree (53%) and seniors over the age of 65 (54%). He holds a seven-point edge over McCormick among women (46-39%) and a slim advantage among men (45-43%).\n\nMcCormick's strength in this poll rest with white voters (45-43%), those without a 4-year degree (43-40%), those between the ages of 30-49 (45-40%) and independents (39-37%).\n\nCasey has a net +6 rating when it comes to favorable opinions (39-33%) with 1-in-5 not sure where they stand on the three-term Democrat. One out of every 12 respondents said they have not heard of the Scranton native.\n\nMcCormick, the former Bridgewater Associates CEO, has nearly equal numbers among the options with 28% favorable, 26% unfavorable, and 29% not sure. Seventeen percent indicated that they were not familiar with McCormick, who spent his youth in Bloomsburg.\n\nIn our average of 12 polls since the start of the calendar year, Casey holds a 6.6-point lead over his GOP opponent, although McCormick has whittled away over the last five, trailing by an average of 5.2 points (46.2-41.0%)\n\nGovernor\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro continues to receive plaudits for his job performance with 64% approving of his work after nearly a year-and-a-half. The number is 13 points higher than Muhlenberg's December survey. Shapiro also saw his disapproval percentage drop two points from 21 to 19%.\n\nElection Integrity\n\nGood news in the fact that more than 55% of respondents agreed with the statements that:\n\nThe bad news is that more than 2 in 5 surveyed still are not confident that the election was secure. Men outnumbered women (48-39) in their confidence level that there was widespread election fraud. That number increases between those with (36%) and without a 4-year degree (48%). Seventy-five percent of those who voted for Trump in 2020 said there was fraud, while just 15% of those who voted for Biden.\n\nNearly 3-in-4 are confident with the use of paper ballots going forward, while 84% have a good feeling about electronic voting systems. However, on the topic of mail ballots, just 57 percent are somewhat or very confident that their use allows for an accurate count of the vote.\n\nRepublicans still have work to do when it comes to convincing its followers to utilize no-excuse mail ballots, as just 26 percent of those who voted for Trump in 2020 feel confident about their use.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nVoter suppression tops the list of the biggest threat to the Commonwealth having a safe, secure and accurate election in 2024. Nearly one-third of respondents indicated that suppression of individuals from voting was the biggest threat, while one-fourth said voter fraud. One in five said the use of mail ballots, while 13% were concerned about foreign interference in the election.", "source": {"uri": "politicspa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Politics PA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhlenberg_College", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muhlenberg College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Casey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Casey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Chris Christie, was one of former President Donald Trump's most vocal critics during the GOP presidential primary season. Early on, Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor, said Trump should drop out because of the array of federal and state charges against him.\n\nOther prominent Republicans have recently said they won't vote for Trump but also won't vote for Biden, who will be the only other major party nominee on the ballot.\n\nFormer House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that he wouldn't be voting for Trump but would instead write in his pick, which he said he also did in 2020.\n\nChristie, also a former federal prosecutor, said he, too, would not vote for Trump but also could not bring himself to vote for Biden, describing him as \"past the sell-by date.\"\n\nChristie said, \"If the American people are stupid enough to nominate these two guys, doesn't mean I have to be stupid, too.\"\n\nNot every anti-Trump Republican has picked that route, though. Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan said Monday he would vote for Biden instead of \"a criminal defendant without a moral compass.\"\n\nWhile critics of the no-Trump-no-Biden school say the narrow margins in swing states and the potential consequences of a second Trump win make that approach untenable, Hutchinson disagreed.\n\n\"I see one candidate that's very dangerous, Donald Trump, for America. I see Joe Biden as reflecting bad policies in America. Our democracy is resilient enough to survive either, but it might challenge it,\" he said.\n\n\"People are all struggling. Some will vote for a third party. Some Republican friends will write-in candidates. Others say we're going to do the team thing, and we need to support Donald Trump. I've indicated I'm not going to do that.\"\n\nTrump, for his part, has appeared to give no credit for what his critics decide to do once they've said they're not voting for him. In a post on his social media site Thursday, Trump railed against Ryan, saying he should be fired from his position as a board member of FOX Corporation, the parent company of FOX News.\n\nTrump posted, \"Ryan is a loser, always has been, and always will be.

They think the nation is not in good shape. They're personally good shape. The polling data has been wrong all along.\"\n\nBiden said that high inflation was the result of \"corporate greed\" and \"shrinkflation,\" after previously blaming COVID-19 supply chain issues and Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"There's corporate greed going on out there,\" the president said.\n\n\"But there's real pain,\" Burnett countered.\n\n\"I mean, grocery prices are up 30% -- more than 30% -- since the beginning of the pandemic. And people are spending more on food and groceries than they have at any time, really, in the past 30 years. I mean, that's a real day-to-day pain that people feel.\"\n\n\"It's real,\" Biden replied, adding, \"But the fact is that if you take a look at what the people have, they have the money to spend; it angers them and angers me that you have to spend more. For example, the whole idea of this notion Senator [Bob] Casey [of Pennsylvania] talked about, shrink inflation. For example, Snickers bar they did a thing, and it's like 20% less for the same price. That's corporate greed, it is corporate greed. And we've got to deal with it.\"\n\nThe pro-Trump super PAC MAGA Inc responded to the interview with a press release saying that \"Joe Biden was confronted with the poor state of Bidenomics during a CNN interview Wednesday and was asked if he's running out of time to improve the economy. Biden lied and said, 'we've already turned it around.'\"\n\nThe group highlighted data showing credit card debt up 38.7% since Biden took office, with 65% of Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck and a record number of people unable to afford rent.\n\nProminent Democrats also have blamed Biden for the inflation crisis, which prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates dramatically.\n\nAverage credit card interest rates currently are 27.64% -- nearly double the 14.6% average when Biden took office -- and average 30-year home mortgage rates have soared from 2.65% to more than 7% for the average 30-year mortgage.\n\nDemocratic economist Steven Rattner, who led the Obama Treasury Department's auto bailout, branded Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus law, passed in March 2021 without any Republican votes, as the \"original sin\" of the inflation crisis.\n\n\"The bill -- almost completely unfunded -- sought to counter the effects of the Covid pandemic by focusing on demand-side stimulus rather than on investment. That has contributed materially to today's inflation levels,\" Ratter wrote in a November 2021 New York Times op-ed.\n\nLarry Summers, who worked as President Barack Obama's top White House economist and as President Bill Clinton's treasury secretary, also blamed Biden's spending.\n\nSummers wrote in a February 2021 Washington Post op-ed that Biden's stimulus bill could \"set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation.\"\n\n\"There's an element in this that the secret sauce of economics is arithmetic,\" Summers reflected in July 2022.\n\n\"And there were many people in the debate who didn't do arithmetic... and they thought more stimulus was good, so more stimulus was better, and they didn't think too much stimulus was really possible.\"", "source":

Biden closed out the summer that same year in the shadow of Philadelphia's Independence Hall, decrying Trumpism as a menace to democratic institutions.\n\nAnd that November, as voters were casting ballots in the midterm elections, Biden again sounded a clarion call to protect democratic institutions, warning that their underpinnings remained under threat.\n\nBiden on Thursday will make his fourth in a series of presidential addresses about the state of democracy, a cause that is a key motivator and a touchstone for him as he tries to remain in office even in the face of low approval ratings and widespread concern from voters about his age.\n\nThe location for this speech, as was the case for the others, was deliberately chosen: It will be near Arizona State University, which houses the McCain Institute, named after the late Arizona Sen. John McCain -- a friend of Biden and the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who spent his public life denouncing autocrats around the globe.\n\nNow, as Biden slowly ramps up his reelection campaign, his core focus on democracy is increasingly intertwined with the political dynamics that are confronting him. His likeliest 2024 opponent, former President Donald Trump, continues to spread falsehoods about the results from the 2020 election and is battling unprecedented criminal charges stemming in part from those lies.\n\nThose challenging Trump for the GOP presidential nomination have largely avoided challenging his election falsehoods and his allies on Capitol Hill are only becoming more emboldened as Trump eggs them on, including toward a looming government shutdown that appears all but inevitable.\n\nIn closed-door fundraisers, Biden has opined at length about his case for reelection, imploring supporters to join his effort to \"literally save American democracy,\" as he described it to a gaggle of wealthy donors earlier this month in New York.\n\n\"I'm running because we made progress -- that's good -- but because our democracy, I think, is still at risk. And I mean it,\" Biden said. \"I don't think it's hyperbole to suggest that. Because our most important freedoms -- the freedom to choose, the freedom to vote, the freedom to be -- the right to be who you are, to love who you love -- is being attacked and shredded today, right now.\"\n\nAdvisers see Biden's continued focus on democracy as not only good policy, but also good politics. Campaign officials have pored over the election results from last November, when candidates who denied the 2020 election results did not fare well in competitive races, and point to polling that showed democracy was a highly motivating issue for voters in 2022.\n\nCandidates who backed Trump's election lies and were running for statewide offices with some influence over elections -- governor, secretary of state, attorney general -- lost their races in every presidential battleground state.\n\nA senior White House official, granted anonymity to preview Biden's Thursday remarks, said his Arizona address will highlight the \"importance of America's institutions in preserving our democracy and the need for constant loyalty to the U.S. Constitution.\" His appearance at the center that honors McCain will also tie into the theme, with Biden set to urge Americans to \"never walk away from the sacrifices generations of Americans have made to defend our democracy.\"\n\nIn few states does Biden's message of democracy resonate more than in Arizona, which became politically competitive during Trump's presidency after seven decades of GOP dominance and later became a hotbed of efforts to overturn or cast doubt on Biden's victory there.\n\nRepublican state lawmakers used their subpoena power to get ahold of all the 2020 ballots and vote-counting machines from Maricopa County, then hired Trump supporters to conduct an unprecedented partisan review of the election. The widely mocked spectacleconfirmed Biden's victory but fueled unfounded conspiracy theories about the election.\n\nLater, the GOP-controlled board of supervisors in one rural county refused to certify the midterm election results, forcing a judge to intervene. The state has seen an exodus of election workers.\n\nAnd last November, voters up and down the ballot rejected Republican candidates who repeatedly denied the results of the 2020 election. Kari Lake, the GOP gubernatorial candidate, has never conceded her loss to now-Gov. Katie Hobbs and is preparing a bid for the U.S. Senate next year. Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters and Mark Finchem, who ran for secretary of state, also repeated fraudulent election claims in their respective campaigns.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., who defeated Masters, appeared at a campaign rally in November alongside former President Barack Obama, who in his remarks framed the race in Arizona as a battle to protect democracy. That message, Kelly now says, not only resonated with members of his own party but independents and moderate GOP voters.\n\n\"I met so many Republicans that were sick and tired of the lies about an election that was two years old,\" Kelly said. \"They were just done with it, and they did not appreciate folks who were running for high offices just lying about it.\"\n\nIndeed, Republicans privately concede that the election-denialism rhetoric that dominated their candidates' message -- as well as the looming specter of Trump -- damaged their efforts to retain the governor's mansion and flip a hotly contested Senate seat, according to three Republican officials who worked in statewide races last cycle.\n\nThe issue of democracy resonated more in Arizona than in other competitive states, and to have candidates deny basic facts on elections helped reinforce claims from Democrats about GOP extremism on other, completely separate issues, said the Republican officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly describe the party's shortcomings last year. Though Trump-animated forces in the party dominated public attention, many Republican voters were concerned about other issues such as the economy and the border and did not want to focus on a past election result.\n\nArizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is seeking the Democratic nomination in next year's Senate race, said a democracy-focused message also is particularly important to two critical blocs of voters in the state: Latinos and veterans, both of whom Gallego said are uniquely affected by election denialism and the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.\n\n\"You know, we come from countries and experiences where democracy is very corrupt, and many of us are only one generation removed from that, but we're close enough to see how bad it can be,\" Gallego said. \"And so Jan. 6 actually was particularly jarring, I think, to Latinos.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Biden is set to speak at a performing arts center on the shore of Tempe Town Lake, a once-dry riverbed that has become an oasis for outdoor recreation in the desert. The lake is the centerpiece of the Rio Salado Project, a riverbed revitalization plan that McCain advocated for until his death.", "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Clearly, that didn't happen. Instead, we got pure, unadulterated Regime Media sycophancy.\n\nBurnett opens the interview with a thematic softball fresh off of Biden's visit to Microsoft's new AI data center, to be built on the site of the former Foxconn project in Wisconsin. Biden was allowed to mumble through his talking point set-pieces, with little to no follow-through.\n\nYou'll be SHOCKED to discover that the former CNBC anchor offers NO pandemic recovery pushback on Biden's job creation whopper. Biden is just allowed to mumble his talking point set pieces unchecked. pic.twitter.com/F9kCD2L3uj\n\n-- Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) May 8, 2024\n\nAbout those \"100,000\" jobs that Burnett and Biden throw around here- it should be noted that the actual site itself expects to generate 2,300 construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs. It's right there on CNN's writeup:\n\nThe new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft said it will use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state on generative AI by 2030, thanks in part to a partnership with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners. It also plans to open a lab on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to help companies and manufacturers infuse the technology into their businesses.\n\nWatch for more of the \"100,000 jobs\" sleight-of-hand, small potatoes for a media that, with the recent and notable exception of Katy Tur, already let Biden get away with claiming pandemic recovery as his creation of 15 million jobs.\n\nWatch next, as Burnett frets that Biden might not have enough time to turn the economy around, to which Biden responds \"I've ALREADY turned it around.\"\n\nCNN's @ErinBurnett empathizes with President Biden on economy: \"With less than six months to go to Election Day, are you worried that you're running out of time to turn that around?\" pic.twitter.com/598wDxQVxW\n\n-- Brent Baker \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 (@BrentHBaker) May 8, 2024\n\nThe biggest and most easily verifiable whopper of the night? Biden claiming that inflation was at 9% when he took office. It was, in fact, at 1.4%, a fact that HAD to have been top of mind for the former CNBC anchor with a background in economics. But alas, no pushback or correction. Simply inexcusable.\n\nAnother unchecked whopper: Biden claims the inflation rate was 9% when he took office. Inflation was in fact 1.4% in January 2021. pic.twitter.com/hLWJfwjUQa\n\n-- Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) May 8, 2024\n\nMoving off of the economy, Burnett offered Biden a bridge from which to pander to \"the youth vote\", assuming they interrupted their \"free Palestine\" chants at college campuses and \"Little Gaza\" encampments in order to watch the interview:\n\nChanneling hate agenda of terrorist-supporting anti-Semites. @ErinBurnett to Biden: \"Mr. President, signs at college campuses, some say 'Genocide Joe.' Many of us who have gone to those campuses, sometimes we hear that chant. Do you hear the message of those young Americans?\" pic.twitter.com/7WnPGehQRU\n\n-- Brent Baker \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 (@BrentHBaker) May 8, 2024\n\nBiden also announced the holdup of weapons shipments to our ally Israel over concerns they may be used in Rafah:\n\nBeyond 2,000 lb. bombs, Biden has held up artillery shipments to Israel over Rafah concerns. pic.twitter.com/i7nZyZIhuM\n\n-- Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) May 8, 2024\n\nNow for the January 6th nostalgia portion of the interview:\n\nAnother softball from @ErinBurnett to Biden to cue up his talking points: \"How seriously do you take\" Trump's \"threat\" to not accept election results? Biden: \"The guy is not a democrat with a small d.\" pic.twitter.com/JgDYrLff5v\n\n-- Brent Baker \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 (@BrentHBaker) May 8, 2024\n\nAnd, finally, some Obama revivalism. What advice might the god-king offer Biden these days? \"Keep doing what I'm doing\", says Biden.\n\nIn her last question, @ErinBurnett relays Democratic concerns, noting Barack Obama \"has said that this is an 'all hands on deck moment,'\" so \"what's his advice to you when you talk to him?\" Biden: \"Keep doing what I'm doing.\" pic.twitter.com/5528QUrFst\n\n-- Brent Baker \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 (@BrentHBaker) May 8, 2024\n\nMost notably from the panel discussion, Scott Jennings and David Axelrod get into it over the parallels between Biden's hold of military assistance to Israel, arguably over political considerations (see the aforementioned \"youth vote\" and the 18% \"Uncommitted\" vote in the Michigan Democrat primary), and former President Donald Trump's call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy- which triggered an impeachment.\n\n.@ScottJenningsKY rightly notes parallels between Biden weapons hold and first impeachment of Trump. And, yes, the Michigan primary and 18% uncommitted vote happened AFTER Gaza City and Khan Younis offensives. pic.twitter.com/Jxhj1pWTWX\n\n-- Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) May 8, 2024\n\nWe were promised an interview.

It would require what experts referred to as a \"perfect storm\" of an exactly right set of states to split between Trump and President Biden.\n\n\"It would lead to a pretty significant, potentially -- I won't call it disastrous -- but disruptive election process if it does happen,\" said Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. \"A low-likelihood scenario, but certainly a problematic one.\"\n\nIn the event that neither Trump nor Biden receives the necessary 270 electoral votes, the election would move to the House of Representatives, which elects the president by giving each state delegation one vote.\n\nA majority of each state's House delegation would decide who receives the state's vote. So if a majority of a state's House members are Republican, Trump would likely receive that vote, and if a majority of a state's House members are Democratic, Biden would likely receive that vote.\n\nIf a state's delegation is evenly divided between the parties and the state's representatives are deadlocked, the state would not vote.\n\nThe Senate would elect the vice president, with each senator casting one vote until one candidate reaches 51 votes. So if a majority of the Senate is Democratic, Harris -- who's almost certain to be the official vice presidential nominee once again -- would likely win, and if Republicans flip the Senate, whoever Trump chooses as his running mate would win.\n\nWhichever candidate receives at least 26 votes in the House would win, but if 26 isn't reached by Inauguration Day in January, the vice president-elect would serve as acting president until the House resolves the situation, according to the National Archives.\n\nThe current Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate are indicators of what could happen if voting goes to Congress. But, importantly, the incoming House and Senate would be responsible for picking the president and vice president, respectively -- not the outgoing lawmakers.\n\nSo, the parties could end up swapping positions as they seek to break a potential tie after November.\n\n\"If a tie were to happen, what's important to remember is that it would be broken not by the current House but by the 'newly elected' House, and not by simple majority of members but by 'state delegations' within the House,\" said Christopher Miller, a political science professor at the University of Richmond. \"This might come as a surprise to many voters, and quite possibly a source of frustration. It's one more reason voters should pay close attention to down-ticket races this fall.\"\n\nThe prospect of a split administration six months out from Election Day isn't far off considering the two candidates have been tied in national polls, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's average of polls.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll from late April found the two tied, a Morning Consult poll from mid-April also found a tie and another mid-April poll from Yahoo News/YouGov had the same result.\n\nOnly one potentially realistic electoral scenario exists where Biden and Trump would both land at 269 electoral votes.\n\nThe main swing states likely to decide the election are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If Trump wins Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, while Biden takes Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, both would be just short of reaching the threshold of 270.\n\nCrucially, Maine and Nebraska distribute some of their electoral votes by the winner of each of their congressional districts instead of through a winner-take-all system as the other states do. Each state's 2nd Congressional District is a battleground district that has flipped back and forth in recent years.\n\nIf Trump wins both of those districts along with the four swing states, the race would be tied at 269 each.\n\nBruce Mehlman, a founder at Mehlman Consulting and a former official under President George W. Bush, noted that a 269-269 tie could happen and argued that the situation comes with a clear resolution.\n\n\"While somewhat remote, an Electoral College tie is possible and in many ways easier to resolve than a situation with hanging chads and a butterfly ballot, competing slates of electors or where Election Day violence may or may not have impacted the final tally,\" Mehlman said.\n\nTwo past elections in U.S. history have resulted in no candidate receiving a majority of electoral votes and the House deciding the contest. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied at 73 electoral votes each in a four-way race, and the House needed 36 ballots to eventually elect Jefferson the president.\n\nIn 1824, Andrew Jackson achieved a plurality of the vote in another four-way race but fell short of a majority. But the second-place finisher in the Electoral College and popular vote, John Quincy Adams, was able to gain enough support in the House to win the presidency.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't respond to a request for comment on the scenario.\n\nThe Biden campaign, meanwhile, has largely brushed off polls months out from Election Day.\n\n\"We don't see polls that are six or seven months out, head-to-head numbers, as any more predictive than a weather report,\" Dan Kanninen, battleground states director for the Biden campaign, told reporters this week.\n\nA former Biden aide told The Hill that the president's team \"would never outwardly convey a sense of panic about something so specific and theoretical.\"\n\n\"I'm skeptical that this particular outcome is being discussed in isolation at this time but it's probably included on a menu of scenarios for a team of attorneys being considered,\" the former aide added.\n\nBut some warned about what a split Republican-Democratic presidency could mean, especially with Trump and Harris together.\n\n\"A Trump-Harris presidency? They would both need full-time food tasters,\" said Democratic strategist Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way. \"In the unlikely event this occurs, Trump would make sure Harris would have the same influence that Mike Pence had when he was vice president: zero.\"\n\nAnd experts warned that such a scenario in which Congress decides the presidency could cause an uproar in the public and further declining faith in the legitimacy of elections, even though this process has been constitutionally established for two centuries.\n\nTrish Crouse, an adjunct professor of political science at the University of New Haven, said an \"outcry\" could happen across the country because of a lack of understanding of how the Electoral College functions and many do not follow elections closely until the outcome.\n\n\"There would be a sense of distrust of the government, thinking that something underhanded is going on, when in reality, this is how the system works,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_gangitano@thehill.com", "name": "Alex Gangitano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false},

'We could do it in D.C., even pinpoint the White House, or in New York when your radical left fascists are finished with the election interference against your political opponent, me.'\n\nTrump has long claimed his litany of legal troubles are politically motivated against him.\n\nThe ex-president called attention to comments Biden made on what Trump called the 'ratings-challenged Howard Stern show.'\n\nDuring a surprise sit-down with Stern late last month, Biden indicated that he would debate Trump.\n\n'I am, somewhere. I don't know when,' the president said. 'But I'm happy to debate him.'\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debate announced in November the dates and locales of the three planned presidential debates and the vice presidential debate, which kick off in mid-September\n\nTrump has said he wants them earlier.\n\nAnd last week, his campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles made that complaint official saying that the 'schedule does not begin until after millions of Americans will have already cast their ballots.'\n\n'This is unacceptable, and by refusing to move up the debates, they are doing a grave disservice to the American public who deserve to hear from both candidates before voting begins,' LaCivita and Wiles said.\n\nThe CPD pushed back in a statement pointing out that the September 16 debate 'will be the earliest televised general election debate ever held.'\n\nThe committee said that only in North Carolina and Pennsylvania will voters be allowed to request and then mail back absentee ballots by this point.\n\nThe CPD also argued that it needed to schedule the first debate after September 6, which is the deadline for three states to certify whether an independent candidate can appear on the ballot.\n\nThe bipartisan group had laid out criteria in November that said third-party candidates would only be considered if they appeared on a sufficient amount of state ballots to win the Electoral College.\n\nThis has been the biggest challenge for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy's campaign, as he's only currently satisifed the requirements to appear on a handful of state general election ballots.\n\nTrump and Biden faced off twice during the 2020 election cycle.\n\nThe second debate was scrapped after Trump caught COVID-19 and refused to participate in it virtually.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Stern", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howard Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Room", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Room"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1984 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Wiles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Susie Wiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_LaCivita", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris LaCivita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

In fact, Donald Trump one day last week emerged from his trial as feisty as ever. A reporter asked if he would like to debate President Joe Biden. Trump didn't hesitate. He effectively reiterated his earlier statement that he's ready to debate Biden, \"Anytime, anywhere, any place.\"\n\nBring it on.\n\nBiden, in turn, didn't back down. He told vulgarian shock-jock Howard Stern he's \"happy to\" debate Trump.\n\nBut whether that's good thinking by either man is, well, a matter of debate, especially for Trump.\n\nRemember what happened in 2020. I'm convinced -- and I'm not alone -- that Trump lost his reelection bid in his first debate with Biden on Sept. 29, 2020. Trump behaved like a maniac. He couldn't keep his mouth shut. Interruption, interruption, interruption.\n\nIn his defense, I know why Trump took such a combative approach. His advisers were mindful of then-Vice President Biden's debate with Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in October 2012. Biden was insufferably condescending, smirking, rolling his eyes, rudely scoffing at his opponent like a petulant brat. It was one of the ugliest debate displays I've ever seen. Trump and his advisers in 2020 must have been mindful of that. And so, Trump didn't give old smirkin' Joe a chance this time around. Each time Biden opened his mouth, Trump pounced.\n\nNot that Biden was any better. He embarrassed himself this time, as well. Though, unlike in 2012 with Ryan, he was the one getting punched. Frankly, it was much deserved, though it didn't score Trump points with voters. Quite the contrary.\n\nTrump-Biden wasn't exactly Lincoln-Douglas.\n\nTo be sure, Trump redeemed himself in the second and final debate Oct. 22, 2020. He was excellent, much more controlled and measured. But it was too late. In the four-week interim, with the election less than two weeks away, the sitting president lost millions of mail-in ballots after that first debate, which, in the narrow election (narrow in terms of Electoral College votes in key swing states), was decisive.\n\nTrump wants to redeem himself in 2024. He's champing at the bit, ready to attack, again. But that will not serve him well, again.\n\nTrump supporters relish the prospect of an addled \"Sleepy Joe\" embarrassing himself on national television, struggling with his teleprompter; they're hoping for a humiliating \"dementia Joe\" moment. It's a sad wish, yes. But they should ask themselves: If Biden has such a moment, would he really lose many supporters? They will vote for him and against Trump no matter what.\n\nLook at what happened here in Pennsylvania in the Senate debate between John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz. Fetterman couldn't even read from the teleprompter. Did it matter to his voters? Not at all. The same would be true if Biden self-destructed on national television.\n\nIn other words, Trump has nothing to gain but much to lose from a debate. He has been ahead of Biden in the polls since October. He could do what Biden did in 2020: campaign from his basement. When you're ahead, don't do anything dumb to blow your lead. Restrain your worst impulses. Assuming that's possible for Trump.\n\nAs for us spectators, we'll watch the spectacle.

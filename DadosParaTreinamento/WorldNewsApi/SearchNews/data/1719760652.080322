{"id": 225010624, "title": "John Lewis shoppers love 'flattering' floral dress perfect for summer occasions", "text": "As wedding season approaches, John Lewis customers are flocking to purchase the Urban Touch Floral Print Dipped Hem Midi Dress, which is currently topping the charts as one of the most sought-after occasionwear dresses available. Boasting a four-star rating, the dress comes in an array of colours including green, blue, navy, mint, peach, and soft pink, and has been hailed as 'incredibly flattering' by satisfied customers leaving reviews online. Labelled as 'popular' and 'selling fast', the dress is available online for \u00a360. Featuring an elegant dipped hem and a cinching belted waist, this Urban Touch midi dress is considered a sophisticated choice for any special event. The John Lewis website describes the dress as \"gently dipped for a flattering look\". Printed with fresh florals throughout, it's a lovely choice for a summer wedding. Featuring a flattering v-neckline and three-quarter length sleeves, it could also be a care-free option for daytime dressing at an event like a barbecue. After a sell-out run, the popular dress is back in stock and flying off the virtual shelves once more. Crafted from 100% polyester, it adds a touch of allure with its plunging design, reports the Liverpool Echo. The dress is so popular that it's now only available in colours green, mint, blue and navy, with limited sizes available for those drawn to soft pink. Pair it with neutral espadrilles or sparkly sandals depending on whether you want to dress it up or down. If you're not yet convinced, take a look at the glowing reviews the Urban Touch Dress has received. One happy customer shared in their review: \"Received some fabulous comments about this dress. The fit was perfect The cut and fabric excellent. I'm trying to resist getting another one in a different colour. This has been my favourite dress purchase in a long time.\" Another customer preparing for a summer wedding wrote: \"I purchased this dress for my daughter's wedding this coming summer. The dress is an easy fit and looks smart and elegant. It will be perfect for the occasion!\" An additional shopper customer said: \"Absolutely beautiful dress, fabric hangs in all the right places, flowy and breathable fabric . Lots of compliments and felt amazing on a very special day.\" A fourth buyer of the dress commented: \"This dress is beautiful, it is as good as it looks in the picture. The fit is excellent, the colour, again, matches the picture and it feels like a quality product. Great value for money. I purchased it for a wedding and with stilettos, clutch and a fascinator it looks gorgeous. I can also wear it with flats for summer parties too so I wholeheartedly recommend this dress.\" Another delighted shopper wrote: \"I bought this for a summer wedding guest outfit and I can't believe how flattering it is. The floaty material and the long almost train like back gives the dress fantastic movement. I'm tempted to get another one in a different colour!\" One thing to be wary of is the sizing of the dress. Many customers recommend sizing down when purchasing, as one buyer wrote: \"Beautiful colour. Hangs lovely and is light and floaty. Wrap is slightly gaping for my taste but a small pin will fix this.\" If you're searching for an alternative floral fit, Marks and Spencer offer the Phase Eight Floral V-Neck Pleated Midi Wrap Dress, though this is more expensive at \u00a3179. For a budget alternative, New Look showcase both the Blue Flower Print Crinkle Flutter Sleeve Midi Dress for \u00a330, or the Pale Grey Jacquard Strappy Ruffle Split Hem Midi Dress if you don't fancy florals.

Teams for Mayweather and McGregor will be requesting a change to 8-ounce gloves Wednesday at the NAC's meeting for the Aug. 26 bout in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of the bout, we should strongly caution against allowing current regulations to be over-ruled,\" Monsell wrote. \"To do so would also set a precedent for future bouts.\"\n\nUnder NAC and most boxing rules, in fights that take place under 147 pounds athletes can wear 8-ounce gloves. But Mayweather vs. McGregor is being contested at 154 pounds and the regulations say 10-ounce gloves are required. NAC executive director Bob Bennett told MMA Fighting two weeks ago that both teams can get a waiver to wear 8-ounce gloves if the commissioners vote in favor of that.\n\n\"They would have to come before the commission and articulate why they should be permitted to have their fight using 8-ounce gloves,\" Bennett said. \"The chairman (Anthony Marnell) and commissioners would make the determination with the health and safety of the fighters being the number-one priority.\"\n\nMayweather said last week that he would be trying to give McGregor another \"advantage\" by making the glove size lighter, since McGregor wears 4-ounce gloves in the UFC. McGregor said he doesn't care either way what the glove size is, but is predicting he'll knock out Mayweather within two rounds if the 8-ounce gloves are worn.\n\n\"Both guys have agreed that they want to fight in 8-ounce gloves,\" Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe said last week at Mayweather's media workout day. \"Both guys are looking to knock each other out. The smaller the gloves, the better. Conor is used to fighting in 4-ounce gloves, Floyd is used to fighting in 8-ounce gloves.\n\n\"I think it's a good thing. I think with the mindset that both guys have, they're looking to knock each other out. ... This isn't a game or anything. If the commission approves it, both guys will be wearing the same ounce gloves. I think the probability increases if both guys are wearing 8-ounce gloves that somebody is getting knocked out.\"", "id": "9525578", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "ARP asks NAC for 'caution' in allowing glove change for MayMac", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ujGYWDh0so7q0L867nsaxIXCW7o=/0x0:2000x1125/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56205483/116_Conor_McGregor_Workout.0.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 572, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 579}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "id": "302718", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}, "id": "314692", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Evidence"}, "id": "315965", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Weight class"}, "id": "385813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mayweather Promotions"}, "id": "1301253", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayweather_Promotions"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 88, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Sporting Goods", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Sporting_Goods"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "17:03:00"}

The letter from the Association of Ringside Physicians to the NAC is as follows:\n\nThe Association of Ringside Physicians understands that consideration is being given to amend current regulations, and in so doing, permit the use of [eight-pounce] gloves in the forthcoming boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor. This is a bout that has already been set a specified weight class. Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of this bout, we would caution strongly against allowing current regulations to be overruled.

Meanwhile, eight-ounce gloves are utilized for bouts taking place at 135 pounds and below.

They handled it fairly and they listened to both requests,\" McGregor said on a teleconference with reporters to talk about the heavily hyped fight with Mayweather on Aug. 26 (Showtime PPV) at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nAlthough Nevada rules stipulate that in boxing matches contracted over 147 pounds the fighters must use 10-ounce gloves, McGregor wanted smaller ones and Mayweather agreed. So, both submitted formal requests to the commission asking for it to issue a waiver for their fight, which is contracted at 154 pounds.\n\nThe commissioners voted unanimously to give the fighters the waiver on Wednesday, when they also appointed Robert Byrd as the referee and Burt Clements, Dave Moretti and Guido Cavalleri as judges.\n\n\"Overall their approach to the decision [about the gloves], the judges and referee -- they were fair throughout in taking into consideration both fighters' requests,\" McGregor said.\n\nMcGregor is accustomed to fighting his UFC bouts in 4-ounce fingerless gloves and said he believed that the lighter boxing gloves will make his punching power more effective against Mayweather, though he acknowledged that the lighter gloves could also give Mayweather even faster hands than he already has.\n\n\"I think that's it in a nutshell. You have pros and cons on both sides,\" he said of the new glove size. \"Both athletes were asking for it, and me, I'm coming up in ounces from what I am used to. Hey, look what I fight with. I fight in 4-ounce fingerless gloves. [The change] benefits both of us in certain ways.\"\n\nOf course, McGregor said he believes the change will benefit him more. He had been predicting a fourth-round knockout, but now that he can wear smaller gloves he said Mayweather won't go past the second round.\n\n\"We are prepared for every possible outcome,\" McGregor said. \"Part of me wants to show some skill and dismantle him that way, [but] I'm ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds.\"\n\nUFC president Dana White said he also believes the switch to the lighter gloves will have a major impact on the fight.\n\n\"I think it affects the contest a lot,\" White said. \"Yes, Floyd will be faster with 8-ounce gloves, but he's more defensive. Conor hits like a truck, so smaller gloves help him big time. I think it absolutely does [work in McGregor's favor].\"\n\nWhite said he was unsure why Mayweather agreed to go along with McGregor's request for the smaller gloves but is happy that he did.

McGregor is scheduled to fight Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a boxing match Aug. 26 in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nBy Tim Dahlberg, Associated Press\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor got their wish to fight in smaller gloves, but not before being chastised by a Nevada boxing official for using the issue to hype their fight later this month.\n\nNevada boxing regulators on Wednesday gave the two fighters an exemption to a rule requiring 10-ounce gloves for fights at 154 pounds, approving 8-ounce gloves for the Aug. 26 bout. Representatives of both fighters appeared before the Nevada State Athletic Commission to request the waiver.\n\nCommissioners also approved veteran referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring for the fight.\n\nCommission Chairman Anthony Marnell said he was comfortable with the fighters using smaller gloves, but unhappy that they used the issue to sell the fight on social media.\n\n\"I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media battle,\" Marnell said.\n\nUnder Nevada regulations, 10-ounce gloves are required in fights above 147 pounds and the bout is set for 154 pounds. But Mayweather has worn 8-ounce gloves most of his career, and McGregor has worn 4-ounce gloves in his UFC fights.\n\nMcGregor said the gloves will only speed up the end of the fight, which he earlier predicted wouldn't last four rounds.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said his fighter is also more comfortable in smaller gloves and would use them to stop McGregor.\n\n\"The fight is going to end in a knockout, I'm very confident,\" Ellerbe said. \"And it will probably be early.\"\n\nMcGregor will be in a boxing ring for the first time as a pro when he takes on Mayweather, who is coming out of retirement for a fight that will make him tens of millions of dollars. They will fight under boxing rules, which will be enforced by Byrd, a veteran of many championship fights.\n\n\"The referee makes a big difference in this fight, which is the specific reason I chose Robert Byrd,\" said Bob Bennett, the commission's executive director.\n\nCommissioners also approved Burt Clements and Dave Moretti of the United States and Italy's Guido Cavalleri as judges for the bout. McGregor's camp had asked for an international judge among the three.\n\nByrd will be paid $25,000 for the bout, while the judges will make $20,000.\n\nThe glove issue took up much of the commission meeting, though in the end all voted in favor of the smaller gloves. There was also discussion about the padding in the gloves, with both sides agreeing to be bound by Nevada boxing inspectors approving the foam padding.\n\nMayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves, including his last six. McGregor has never boxed before, but quickly agreed to Mayweather's challenge on social media to fight in smaller gloves.\n\nUFC chief Dana White echoed McGregor in saying the smaller gloves will make a difference in the fight.\n\n\"It affects the fight big time,\" White said. \"When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don't know what changed but I'm glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.\"\n\nCommissioners said they struggled with making an exception to regulations in place since 2006, but decided to approve the waiver because of the unusual nature of the event.\n\n\"The fight is not normal,\" said commissioner Sandra Morgan.\n\nJohn Hornewer, an attorney for Mayweather, said the unbeaten boxer would likely not be at the 154-pound limit at the fight weigh-in anyway.\n\n\"He'll be 150 pounds. That's his best weight and there's no reason to put on extra weight,\" Hornewer said.\n\nA McGregor representative said his fighter has been about 160 pounds in training camp and would likely enter

However, the ARP urged the NSAC not to vote in favor of the change in an official release.\n\nThe Association of Ringside Physicians understands that consideration is being given to amend current regulations, and in so doing, permit the use of 8oz Gloves in the forthcoming boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor. This is a bout that has already been set a specific weight class. Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of this bout, we would strongly caution against allowing current regulation to be over-ruled. To do so would also set a precent for future bouts.\n\n(via Jesse Holland of MMAmania.com)\n\nMayweather proposed to McGregor that they should fight in 8 ounce gloves instead of 10 ounces on his Instagram page, according to Holland.\n\n\"I'll be wearing 8oz.

I don't give a fuck about the size of the glove. I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\"\n\nThe UFC lightweight champion also said that he doesn't care about fighting with lighter gloves because he uses 4ounce gloves in the UFC. \"If we're wearing eight-ounce gloves, I'm struggling to see how he lasts two rounds, and that's the God's honest truth.\"\n\nMayweather told the Boxing Scene that McGregor was complaining about the glove sizes. \"So I said, 'Listen, let's do eight ounces.

Representatives of both fighters appeared before the Nevada State Athletic Commission to request the waiver.\n\nCommissioners also approved veteran referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring for the fight.\n\n\u00d7 Advertisement\n\nCommission Chairman Anthony Marnell said he was comfortable with the fighters using smaller gloves, but unhappy that they used the issue to sell the fight on social media.\n\n\"I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media battle,\" Marnell said.\n\nUnder Nevada regulations, 10-ounce gloves are required in fights above 147 pounds and the bout is set for 154 pounds. But Mayweather has worn 8-ounce gloves most of his career, and McGregor has worn 4-ounce gloves in his UFC fights.\n\nMcGregor said the gloves will only speed up the end of the fight, which he earlier predicted wouldn't last four rounds.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said his fighter is also more comfortable in smaller gloves and would use them to stop McGregor.\n\n\"The fight is going to end in a knockout, I'm very confident,\" Ellerbe said. \"And it will probably be early.\"\n\nMcGregor will be in a boxing ring for the first time as a pro when he takes on Mayweather, who is coming out of retirement for a fight that will make him tens of millions of dollars. They will fight under boxing rules, which will be enforced by Byrd, a veteran of many championship fights.\n\n\"The referee makes a big difference in this fight, which is the specific reason I chose Robert Byrd,\" said Bob Bennett, the commission's executive director.\n\nCommissioners also approved Burt Clements and Dave Moretti of the United States and Italy's Guido Cavalleri as judges for the bout. McGregor's camp had asked for an international judge among the three.\n\nByrd will be paid $25,000 for the bout, while the judges will make $20,000.\n\nThe glove issue took up much of the commission meeting, though in the end all voted in favor of the smaller gloves. There was also discussion about the padding in the gloves, with both sides agreeing to be bound by Nevada boxing inspectors approving the foam padding.\n\nMayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves, including his last six. McGregor has never boxed before, but quickly agreed to Mayweather's challenge on social media to fight in smaller gloves.", "id": "9637472", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Mayweather

Its promoters will have five days after Sunday's total eclipse of the sun to turn attention back to their Aug. 26 boxing match between unbeaten boxing champ Floyd Mayweather and pro cage fighter Conor McGregor.\n\nAlready making things more interesting going into \"eclipse weekend,\" the odds are tightening and some problematic lighter gloves have been approved for the fight.\n\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission ruling on gloves added a dimension that the fight is a sanctioned boxing match, in addition to a made-for-whatever-goes Vegas event, and that McGregor was coming to the ring as a boxer, not a UFC mixed martial arts cage fighter.\n\nAs expected, Mayweather remains the favorite. But the odds have dropped as more fans put their money on the trash-talking McGregor, who claims he'll knock out \"Money\" Mayweather within four rounds.\n\nBefore the fight was even officially announced, Mayweather was a -2250 favorite while McGregor was at +950, CBS Sports noted. A little more than a week before what some are calling \"the biggest fight in history,\" Mayweather was just a -450 favorite while McGregor was a +325 underdog on Thursday, OddsShark.com said.\n\n(If you don't understand odds, it means everyone was still betting Mayweather will smear McGregor, but more people are starting to look for a long shot to come in, or are betting emotionally.)\n\nThe Bleacher Report suggested part of this could be due to McGregor's attention-making antics during the two fighters' four-city promotional tour, including some dicey dialogue between them.\n\nMcGregor got back in the spotlight by bringing up lighter gloves.\n\nMcGregor is accustomed to fighting in 4-ounce gloves, but the Nevada State Athletic Commission typically requires boxers to fight in 10-ounce gloves when competing at 154 pounds or more, USA Today noted, with more padding to absorb more shock generated by higher bodyweights.\n\nMcGregor predicted he would \"floor\" Floyd in the first round if they were boxing with lighter gloves.\n\n\"If we are in 8-ounce gloves, he will be floored multiple times in the first round,\" McGregor said. \"I believe first-round KO in 8-ounce gloves. The fact I can't follow through in MMA and pound the head into the canvas and there's a 10-count in boxing, maybe I'll give him second round. But 8-ounce gloves, he will be done in two.\"\n\nCoach John Kavanagh believes Conor McGregor can KO Mayweather in the 1st round if they were to fight in 8 oz gloves https://t.co/TB5uw2T321 pic.twitter.com/76fWvvkjs5 -- MMAFighting.com (@MMAFighting)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nNaturally, there was back-and-fourth between the two fighters, and Mayweather took to social media, saying he was open to fighting in 8-ounce gloves, delighting everyone but the boxing commission's doctors who questioned the safety of lighter gloves.\n\nIn any case, the NSAC on Wednesday voted unanimously in favor of the fight taking place in 8-ounce gloves - a one-time exception to its rules, ESPN said.\n\n\"I'm very happy with how (the commission) handled it,\" McGregor said. \"They took both fighters requests into consideration and I'm very happy with it. You've got pros and cons on both sides and both athletes asking for it. I am coming up in weight on the gloves. Look at what I fight with (normally).\"\n\nMayweather's willingness to fight in smaller gloves, to McGregor's advantage, likely comes as a surprise to many, considering something Mayweather told ESPN's Stephen A. Smith in a recent one-on-one interview.\n\n\"He's a lot younger. When you look at myself and Conor McGregor on paper, he's taller, has a longer reach, he's a bigger man from top to bottom,\" Mayweather said, per Bleacher Report. \"He's a lot younger, so youth is on his side. And I've been off a couple of years. And I'm in my 40s.

He says he'll fight UFC fighters if the paycheck is there. Obviously, a rematch with McGregor in the UFC would bring Mayweather a ton of money. He might even make more money fighting McGregor in the UFC than he will in a boxing ring in their fight on August 26.\n\nThere are an awful lot of people that want to see Mayweather lose, and if he faces McGregor under the rules of MMA, he's probably going to lose badly. McGregor has too many advantages in the octagon. If Mayweather has devastating punching power, and the ability to kick and prevent take downs, he probably could beat McGregor in the octagon. Mayweather can't punch, and he'll never learn how to kick or prevent a take down from McGregor. It would take Mayweather too long to learn those things. His lack of power will never change.\n\n\"As of right now, we got to get past August 26,\" said Mayweather when asked by Jimmy Kimmel if he'll fight McGregor in a rematch in the octagon in the UFC. \"Once we get past August 26, then we can talk about other things,\" said Mayweather in discussing a possible rematch against McGregor.\n\nI think Mayweather will come back for at least 1 rematch with McGregor. Hopefully, the two fighters don't face each other 3 times. It would be forlorn at that point in seeing Mayweather and McGregor still fighting beyond 2017.\n\nThe McGregor fight might need to bring in 5 million buys on Showtime PPV for Mayweather to make $350 million. We don't have any clue what the fight will bring in. It might only do 2 million buys or less. Mayweather will end up with far less than $350M if the fight only does 2 million buys. With all the boxing and MMA fans that will be pirating the fight on the internet, it's probably a pipe dream on Mayweather's part to count on him being able to make $350 million buys. Don't get me wrong. Mayweather is going to make a ton of money for the McGregor fight, but I think it will be well short of $350 million. That'll require an enormous amount of PPV buys from the consumers.\n\nThe Mayweather vs. McGregor fight is perceived as a circus event between a guy that has never laced up a pair of gloves before in a professional fight facing a retired former world champion boxer, who is coming back from a 2-year retirement to collect a paycheck. The fans know what this fight is all about. They're not stupid. Even the casual fans are aware that McGregor has zero chance of winning. If these same fans still want to see the fight badly enough on August 26 to pay the inflated $100 asking price to order the Mayweather-McGregor fight on Showtime PPV, then it might do well. I doubt it though. My prediction is Mayweather will make less than half of the $350 million than he's expecting to get for the fight. You can't blame Mayweather for dreaming though. I just don't think his dream is going to come true.\n\n\"If the paycheck is there, we're going to make it happen,\" said Mayweather. \"$350 million,\" said Mayweather in bragging about what he THINKS he'll be making in the McGregor fight.", "id": "9496402", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Mayweather not ready to discuss McGregor rematch yet \" Boxing News", "image": "http://www.boxingnews24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mayweather.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 93, "amb": false, "textEnd": 102, "freq": 5, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Short film"}, "id": "304896", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Piracy"}, "id": "313367", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kick"}, "id": "328486", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Octagon"}, "id": "382893", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octagon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}, "id": "387933", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punching power"}, "id": "420928", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punching_power"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 169, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 255, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 297, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Psychology", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 309, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Tools and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Tools_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 403, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain Names", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain_Names"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "14:17:00"}

With the change in glove size, he has revised his pre-fight prediction, promising a knockout in the second round instead of the fourth.\n\n\"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds,\" McGregor said. \"We are ready for absolutely every scenario. I am ready to go to war for the full 12 rounds and I'm ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds. That's where my head is at.\"\n\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission has agreed to allow the fighters to wear smaller boxing gloves for their Aug. 26 fight in Las Vegas. The bout was granted a special exemption at the request of both fighters. McGregor and Mayweather will battle in 8-ounce gloves, not the 10-ounce variety typically required by the commission.\n\n[Early Lead: Big money comes in on Mayweather]\n\n\"It affects the contest a lot,\" said UFC President Dana White. \"First of all, Floyd will be faster with 8-ounce gloves. Floyd is a defensive master. .\u2009.\u2009. Connor hits like a truck. Smaller gloves favor him big time.\"\n\nMcGregor, the UFC's lightweight champion who has never before boxed professionally, has built his name and reputation wearing 4-ounce gloves used in mixed martial arts. He clearly believes Wednesday's ruling will give him added punching power.\n\n\"You've got pros and cons on both sides,\" he said on a teleconference. \"You got both athletes asking for the request and then you got me coming up in ounces from what I'm used to. I know the media likes to go, '10, eight .\u2009.\u2009. .' but look what I fight with. I fight with 4-ounce gloves. Fingerless gloves. The knuckles are barely covered with what I'm used to .\u2009.\u2009. so I'm very happy with it.\"\n\n[Early Lead: Mayweather says McGregor has the edge. Really.]\n\nWhile McGregor, 29, certainly feels the lighter gloves are to his advantage, Mayweather, 40, has actually fought most of his career wearing 8-ounce gloves and is the one who proposed the change. Under Nevada rules, fights contested above 147 pounds must be fought with 10-ounce gloves. Mayweather has only fought above 147 a few times, most notably his 2007 win over Oscar De La Hoya (154 pounds), his 2012 win over Miguel Cotto (154) and his 2013 win over Canelo Alvarez (a catchweight of 152).\n\n\"How often you've worn the gloves or any of that never factored in. I didn't even know that for instance,\" McGregor said of Mayweather's history with 8-ounce gloves. \"I do not care about his record. I do not care about his achievements. Every fight is on a fight-by-fight basis, so that's the way we approach it.\"\n\nDespite the change, Mayweather will still enter the fight as a heavy favorite. Considered one of the best defensive fighters in the history of the sport, he'll be facing an MMA star making his boxing debut. With a 49-0 record and more than 15 title belts over five weight classes, Mayweather, who retired from boxing following his last bout 23 months ago, has topped more seasoned fighters, most of them handily, regardless of glove size.\n\nEven if McGregor packs a stronger punch, he still faces the challenge of laying one of those 8-ounce gloves on his more experienced foe.", "id": "9582703",

Clements, Dave Moretti and Italy's Guido Cavalerri as judges.\n\nByrd previously worked Mayweather's one-sided and uneventful unanimous-decision victory over Robert Guerrero in May 2013.\n\nThis bout is expected to be a far greater challenge for the referee, considering that McGregor is making his pro boxing debut and the possibility that he could turn to the rougher fighting techniques employed in the UFC.\n\nThe decision on the gloves came after both fighters lobbied for a change from a 2006 rule adopted as a safety measure that stipulates 10-ounce gloves for fights above 154 pounds. Bulkier, higher-weight gloves are believed to soften the impact of more forceful punches. McGregor has said he will likely weigh as much as 170 pounds on fight night.\n\nOne commissioner, Skip Avansino, said despite the fact that \"that's the rule,\" there has been no scientific study on why 10-ounce gloves are needed for 154-pound fights, and said an adjustment can be \"reconsidered by this unprecedented fight.\"\n\nChairman Anthony Marnell III said, \"My biggest concern is I don't like the Nevada commission being used as a pawn in a social-media battle,\" that occurred between the two fighters. \"If you cut a deal for a fight with this much money, you should get it right.\"\n\nMarnell said he wanted commissioners to screen the gloves as part of launching a new study to consider if 8-ounce gloves can be used in future 154-pound fights.\n\nMcGregor wanted gloves nearer in size to the 4-ounce gloves he uses as a UFC fighter, believing his punching power will be more effective.\n\n\"I'm strong enough to give him two rounds,\" in eight-ounce gloves, McGregor said. \"The only reason [Mayweather] can get to the second round is because in this game the referee gives him time to recover [with an eight-count] without getting his head pounded into the canvas. That's the only reason he might make it to the second round.\"\n\nIn the fight contract, Mayweather requested \"no Mexican-made gloves, no gloves made of horsehair, only 10-ounce. I didn't even know the difference,\" McGregor said. \"I didn't really care. Now he's pushing for the 8-ounce. Great.\"\n\nMayweather has said the 8-ounce gloves will give him more punching power, as well, which could enhance his chances of posting his first knockout victory since 2011.\n\nMcGregor's representative said at Wednesday's meeting that he believes \"there is no inherent risk to the health and safety\" of the Irishman by fighting Mayweather in 8-ounce gloves. The representative said McGregor has trained exclusively in 10-ounce gloves.\n\nThe McGregor representative said the gloves will not be Mexican-made or contain any horsehair.\n\nNevada Commissioner J. Daniel Carpenter, said, \"We want great entertainment, but we want the health and safety of the fighters, first and foremost,\" noting a recent MMA fighter's death, but also expressing trust in a referee like Byrd to stop punishment that could endanger either fighter.\n\n\"This is a hybrid fight. An individual who's never stepped foot in a boxing ring against one of the best ... boxers ever.\"\n\nIf the fight goes the distance, the outcome will be decided by the judges, including Moretti, who's judged 10 Mayweather fights since 2005.\n\nMoretti has been favorable to Mayweather in two of his most compelling bouts, awarding him a wide 118-110 (10 rounds to two) advantage in the record-setting 2015 bout against Manny Pacquiao, and giving Mayweather eight rounds in what was seen as a more narrow decision over Marcos Maidana in their first 2014 fight.\n\nCavalerri was added to the mix to fulfill a request by McGregor's camp to have one international judge as part of the panel.\n\nClements has worked four Mayweather fights, including the victories over Pacquiao and Juan Manuel Marquez in 2009.\n\nlance.pugmire@latimes.com\n\n@latimespugmire\n\nALSO\n\nNevada won't use referee Kenny Bayless for Mayweather-McGregor fight\n\nConor McGregor wants to keep boxing and

The NSAC determined that wearing smaller gloves that have less padding poses no significantly greater threat to the health and safety of Mayweather and McGregor, a UFC superstar who'll make his professional boxing debut.\n\nMayweather's handlers petitioned the NSAC recently to use eight-ounce gloves because the boxing legend is willing to use the lighter gloves McGregor claimed Mayweather refused to wear during negotiations.\n\nIn accordance with Association of Boxing Commissions regulations, boxers who compete above the welterweight limit of 147 pounds are required to wear 10-ounce gloves. In bouts contested at or below the welterweight limit, ABC rules require boxers to wear eight-ounce gloves.\n\nThe weight limit for the 12-round bout between Las Vegas' Mayweather (49-0, 26 KOs) and Ireland's McGregor (21-3, 18 KOs in MMA) is boxing's junior middleweight maximum of 154 pounds.\n\nRepresentatives for Mayweather and McGregor agreed to use comparable gloves, but a brand was not mentioned during the meeting. They did state that they would not use what are considered \"puncher's gloves,\" which would give McGregor more of an advantage.\n\nNeither Mayweather nor McGregor attended the NSAC meeting Wednesday, but attorneys for both boxers accepted any additional liability that could come with using eight-ounce gloves in this Showtime Pay-Per-View main event.\n\nThe 40-year-old Mayweather mostly has fought with eight-ounce gloves during his 20-year pro career, but has used 10-ounce gloves for his three fights contested above 147 pounds (Oscar De La Hoya, Miguel Cotto and Canelo Alvarez). The 29-year-old McGregor is used to fighting in four-ounce gloves, the standard for professional mixed martial arts matches.\n\nMcGregor has predicted that wearing eight-ounce gloves will enable him to knock out Mayweather within two rounds.\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

Representatives of both fighters appeared before the Nevada State Athletic Commission to request the waiver.\n\nCommissioners also approved veteran referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring for the fight.\n\nCommission Chairman Anthony Marnell said he was comfortable with the fighters using smaller gloves, but unhappy that they used the issue to sell the fight on social media.\n\n\"I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media battle,\" Marnell said.\n\nUnder Nevada regulations, 10-ounce gloves are required in fights above 147 pounds and the bout is set for 154 pounds. But Mayweather has worn 8-ounce gloves most of his career, and McGregor has worn 4-ounce gloves in his UFC fights.\n\nMcGregor said the gloves will only speed up the end of the fight, which he earlier predicted wouldn't last four rounds.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said his fighter is also more comfortable in smaller gloves and would use them to stop McGregor.\n\n\"The fight is going to end in a knockout, I'm very confident,\" Ellerbe said. \"And it will probably be early.\"\n\nMcGregor will be in a boxing ring for the first time as a pro when he takes on Mayweather, who is coming out of retirement for a fight that will make him tens of millions of dollars. They will fight under boxing rules, which will be enforced by Byrd, a veteran of many championship fights.\n\n\"The referee makes a big difference in this fight, which is the specific reason I chose Robert Byrd,\" said Bob Bennett, the commission's executive director.\n\nCommissioners also approved Burt Clements and Dave Moretti of the United States and Italy's Guido Cavalleri as judges for the bout. McGregor's camp had asked for an international judge among the three.\n\nByrd will be paid $25,000 for the bout, while the judges will make $20,000.\n\nThe glove issue took up much of the commission meeting, though in the end all voted in favor of the smaller gloves. There was also discussion about the padding in the gloves, with both sides agreeing to be bound by Nevada boxing inspectors approving the foam padding.\n\nMayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves, including his last six. McGregor has never boxed before, but quickly agreed to Mayweather's challenge on social media to fight in smaller gloves.\n\nUFC chief Dana White echoed McGregor in saying the smaller gloves will make a difference in the fight.\n\n\"It affects the fight big time,\" White said. \"When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don't know what changed but I'm glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.\"\n\nCommissioners said they struggled with making an exception to regulations in place since 2006, but decided to approve the waiver because of the unusual nature of the event.\n\n\"The fight is not normal,\" said commissioner Sandra Morgan.\n\nJohn Hornewer, an attorney for Mayweather, said the unbeaten boxer would likely not be at the 154-pound limit at the fight weigh-in anyway.\n\n\"He'll be 150 pounds. That's his best weight and there's no reason to put on extra weight,\" Hornewer said.\n\nA McGregor representative said his fighter has been about 160 pounds in training camp and would likely enter the ring somewhere around that weight after making the 154-pound limit the day before.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App", "id": "9623727", "details": {}, "date":

Getty Images\n\nFloyd Mayweather says he's in for the fight of his life with Irish mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor in their much-anticipated Las Vegas bout on August 26. \"He's a lot younger,\" Mayweather told ESPN last week. \"When you look at myself and Conor McGregor on paper, he's taller, has a longer reach, he's a bigger man from top to bottom. He's a lot younger, so youth is on his side,\" Mayweather said of the 29-year-old McGregor. \"And I've been off a couple of years. And I'm in my 40s. So, if you look at everything on paper, it leans toward Conor McGregor.\"\n\nWow. Mayweather's assessment sounded so much like the talking points coming out McGregor's camp the only thing missing was an Irish brogue. Is it possible that the 49-0 Mayweather, the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world before he retired two years ago, thinks McGregor has the upper hand? Nope. Floyd's just pumping money into the market.\n\nMayweather is a great boxer, and one of sport's all-time best businessmen. In 2015 he was Forbes magazine's highest-paid athlete. His net worth is estimated at around $400 million, and his career earnings are likely to soar past $1 billion with the McGregor fight. Where most boxers, even champions, are dependent on their business handlers for their living, Mayweather wisely took control of the means of production and in 2007 exercised a clause freeing him from his contract with Top Rank and started promoting his own fights. In 2013, he jumped from HBO to Showtime for a six-fight deal that guaranteed him at least $30 million per fight, including the massive pay-per-view payout (more than $200 million) from his May 2015 fight with Manny Pacquiao. Mayweather is keen to preserve the integrity of his nickname, \"Money,\" by making sure there's enough interest in the McGregor fight to bring in the pay-per-view dollars.\n\nThe thing you have to understand about Mayweather is that he never leaves money on the table. For instance, lots of viewers who tuned in for his September 2013 fight with Canelo Alvarez couldn't figure out why Justin Bieber was part of Mayweather's pre-fight entourage. \"About 90 minutes prior to the fight, Bieber made a clumsy entrance into Mayweather's dressing room, barging in with hand-slaps and bro-hugs,\" writes ESPN's Tim Keown. \"Mayweather nodded in Bieber's direction but otherwise ignored him. Thirty minutes later, though, came the crystallizing moment: Mayweather wordlessly called Bieber over, put his arm around him and said, 'Take a photo and send it out to your followers.' For a moment, Bieber looked a part of Money's posse. . . . And assuming even an infinitesimal portion of those 48,735,521 Beliebers persuaded their parents to buy the fight, they juiced the fight's record payday of nearly $150 million in pay-per-views. Suddenly, the pairing that makes no sense at all made all the sense in the world.\"\n\nFast forward to today and Mayweather is worried that fans might be losing interest in the McGregor fight because the Irishman's camp looks like a mess.\n\nTwo weeks ago, retired welterweight Paulie Malignaggi headed out to Las Vegas to spar with McGregor, and left abruptly after McGregor's team leaked pictures and videos of a sparring session which suggested that the MMA fighter got the better of the former two-time world champion. In one disputed scene, Malignaggi hits the canvas -- by knockdown, says McGregor's camp, including president of the United Fighting Championship Dana White. Malignaggi says he was pushed, and urged Team McGregor release film of the entire session, which will show, says the Brooklyn fighter, that he beat McGregor all 12 rounds.\n\nAfter leaving the UFC champion's camp, Malignaggi said that McGregor \"whimpers like a girl\" when hit by body shots. \"This guy is one of the biggest dirtbags I've ever met in my life -- bar none,\" said Malignaggi, whose profession is not short on big dirtbags.\n\n\"I was amazed at what a dirtbag this person is. I don't care if we never speak again. My life is fine if I never see Conor McGregor again,\" he said. (And Malignaggi had even harsher words for White.)\n\nMcGregor's camp showed it's a little short on class by releasing pictures making someone else look bad to make their fighter look good. By contrast, Mayweather's training partners say that Floyd has nothing but respect for the guys who come to his camp to help him prepare, fighters who know they're going to get outclassed by Mayweather every time they step into the ring.\n\nIf the footage was indeed altered by McGregor's people it won't have been the first time. Last summer, South African boxer Chris Van Heerden got mad when edits made it look like McGregor owned him, so he released a fuller account of the action that showed otherwise. The fact is, it's not a good sign that McGregor is making noise about thumping sparring partners. If he did manhandle a retired and out of shape Malignaggi, as he claims, then it's hardly worth the distraction. If he didn't, if he's revising reality to make himself look like a better boxer, it suggests that both the fighter and his camp realize he's overmatched and are trying to camouflage his lack of boxing skills. Film editors aren't much help in a boxer's corner -- unless McGregor's also doubles as a cut-man. Because that fellow is likely to see a lot of blood August 26.\n\nMcGregor's open workout for the press last week hardly convinced fight fans he's ready for Mayweather (here's Mayweather's open workout). The Irishman is a tough guy who knows what it takes to be a champion, expert commentator Teddy Atlas remarked on ESPN -- \"he knows what to do when the wolf is at the door,\" Mike Tyson's former assistant trainer uttered lyrically -- but his boxing skills, continued Atlas, are amateur at best. Sure he's quick, said Atlas, but nothing like Mayweather. (Here's a clip of Floyd working the mitts with his uncle Roger Mayweather -- note not just the speed, but the timing and reflexes as well.) The two things you're taught when you first walk into a boxing gym, MMA champion Chael Sonnen told the ESPN audience, are to keep your hands up and your chin down. McGregor, said Sonnen, does neither. Those are two obvious chinks in the armor that would make him vulnerable to any boxer, amateur or professional.\n\nThen there's something else I noticed during McGregor's workout. He's a southpaw -- which allegedly gives Mayweather trouble, but not so much trouble that he's ever lost to one -- but he switches sometimes to an orthodox stance. This isn't that unusual, and really terrific pros that have power in both hands and are exceptionally agile, like Terence Crawford, the 29-year-old undefeated champion out of Omaha, Nebraska, can use it to their advantage. Switching angles like that, and popping with both hands hard can really baffle opponents -- but you need to know what you're doing, which comes from long practice in the gym learning the footwork and the distance from your opponent required to switch sides, or else you get tangled up, which increases your chances of getting hit hard. Then you have to practice the move sparring, and finally try it out in a real fight. But McGregor has very few of these hours under his belt. If he tries it with Mayweather -- not exactly the appropriate venue for experimental labwork -- my bet is that the second or third time he's stepping over he'll walk into a big right hand. And Mayweather has much more power than he's typically given credit for.\n\nIt might come as a surprise to casual observers that in almost all of the betting so far something like 85 percent of the money -- and 95 percent of the betting tickets -- has come down on McGregor. That's because it makes no sense to bet on Mayweather, the huge favorite. Here's how the line has changed since November, months before the fight was announced in June. Mayweather opened at -2250, with the minus sign designating the favorite, and McGregor at +950. That means, to win $100 on Mayweather, you have to bet $2250. If you're taking McGregor, a $100 bet will net you $950. Immediately after the fight was announced, it was -800 Mayweather and +500 McGregor, and as of August 12 it's -500 Mayweather and +350 McGregor.\n\nBut the improved price on Mayweather -- still an insanely huge favorite -- doesn't reflect McGregor's improved chances, it only reflects the oddsmakers' response to the amount of money out on McGregor. Presumably Mayweather's Br'er Rabbit routine suggesting that McGregor looks great on paper is meant not only to generate PPV interest but also to further drive the odds down. (An $880,000 ticket on Mayweather this week, the largest bet so far on the fight, would earn $160,000 -- the kind of safe bet typical of hedge fund managers, not professional gamblers.) Mayweather is a famously degenerate gambler who bets on everything, including, it's assumed, himself. McGregor says he's betting a million euros on himself, and encourages friends to help themselves to an easy payday.\n\nAlmost no one's buying it. Ring announcer David Diamante says McGregor is the worst opponent Mayweather has ever faced. \"I don't see any scenario in a boxing match where McGregor's going to win,\" Diamante said. \"You don't want the guy getting hurt, number one. Number two, from a boxing standpoint, many people have tried to crack the Mayweather code . . . I believe that McGregor, if he wants any chance, needs to get on him really early and try and rough him up.\"\n\nLots of fight fans believe that's exactly what will happen: McGregor will press hard and may even surprise Mayweather the first round or two -- then Floyd will figure him out, adjust, and dominate. Others say that's not good enough. Chael Sonnen says that Mayweather needs to make quick work of McGregor or it will be a stain on boxing. If a guy who's never fought a professional boxing match can stand toe-to-toe with an undefeated champion for even two rounds, says Sonnen, it's a disaster for boxing.\n\nHe's got a point -- if a ski-jumping champion, for instance, challenged a slalom racer who dominated the sport and beat him in his own discipline, it wouldn't reflect well on slalom racing. Or, if an NFL place-kicker who hadn't played soccer since 8th grade led the Premier League in scoring, etc.\n\nTeddy Atlas believes that boxing can't win. If Mayweather beats McGregor, he was supposed to, and if he doesn't, well, forget about it. David Diamante sees one upside, if Mayweather wins, \"Hopefully people will say this guy, McGregor's at the top of Mixed Martial Arts and this boxing guy dispatched of him so easily, wow maybe there's something to this boxing thing and maybe they'll try to get into it more and take a look.\"\n\nThe catch, which Mayweather is surely aware of, is that the fight's priced on Showtime for $100. If he dispatches of McGregor too easily, lots of fans will feel ripped off. If the fight lasts the full 12 rounds and there's not enough action, fans will say it was the same as the much-hyped Pacquiao fight and will feel ripped off. McGregor guarantees he'll stop Mayweather in the fourth round. Floyd concurs with part of that assessment -- it won't go the distance, he says, but not in McGregor's favor.", "id": "9860588", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Why Does Floyd

And yet, despite those figures, the fight failed to come close to expectations. To write that wrong, Mayweather plans to go \"straight ahead\" against McGregor rather than take his time like he usually does because \"the fans deserve it.\"\n\nIf the McGregor fight is trending where Mayweather expects it to, he could also make significantly more money than he did from the Pacquiao fight. While his payout was believed to be at least $220 million for his unanimous victory in 2015, Mayweather told Kimmel that he could make well over $300 million whether he wins or loses against McGregor.\n\n\"$350 million,\" Mayweather said. \"Yes.

McGregor says he'd like to show off his boxing skills to the fans, but he prefers to get destroy the 40-year-old Mayweather quickly within 10 seconds.\n\nThe 8oz gloves that the Nevada State Athletic Commission approved for the Mayweather-McGregor fight will surely help McGregor's cause in getting the aging Mayweather out of there as fast as possible on August 26.\n\n\"We are prepared for every possible outcome,\" Conor McGregor said. \"Part of me wants to show some skill and dismantle him that way. I'm ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds.\"\n\nIt's smart for McGregor to look to get the fight over with while Mayweather isn't fully warmed up for the fight. Once Mayweather gets his 40-year-old legs limbered up, he'll be moving around the ring to keep from getting hit. It'll make McGregor's job much harder once Mayweather starts moving. I don't know what we're going to see with Mayweather. He's talking about going straight at McGregor to slug with him. He wants to make the boxing fans happy by giving them a knockout. However, coming events cast their shadows before.\n\nMayweather said in the past that he would make it exciting for the fans, but he's failed to deliver. The only thing the boxing can predict about Mayweather is more of his past behavior. He'll promise an exciting fight, but then play it safe in a safety first type of affair on the night of the fight. With Mayweather, you have to go by his actions rather than on what he says. It's better for McGregor to try and get Mayweather out before he starts moving around the ring.\n\n\"I'm very happy with how the promotion has gone,\" said McGregor.\n\nMcGregor could be making $100 million for the fight if it brings in the 4.6 million that Mayweather believes it'll bring in on Showtime PPV. Mayweather is talking about getting $350 million for the fight. The truth is probably somewhere in between the $350 million number.\n\nAfter McGregor gets his paycheck for the fight he says, it'll be the \"counting game.\"\n\nIt's really difficult to predict how well the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight will do. There's a lot of attention on the fight, but it seems more like the MMA fans are the ones that are more interested in the match rather than the boxing fans, who seem to know better. The MMA fans might not realize how good of a fighter Mayweather is. If they knew, they might want to purchase the fight. It's going to be tough for them watch their hero McGregor get knocked around the ring if he's unable to score a fast knockout like he's talking about.\n\n\"This is a special historic event and everybody is excited about it,\" said McGregor.\n\nIt's in the eye of the beholder when it comes to fans being excited about the Mayweather-McGregor. I don't know there's a lot of excitement. It's more of a case of the fans know that McGregor is likely to lose, and they want to see for themselves if he can maybe score a lucky knockout. I wouldn't say there's a lot of excitement. I'd it's more of a predictable outcome that many fans are hoping won't come true. The fans seem to want to see McGregor win, but they appear to know that he has virtually no chance.\n\n\"Join the queue,\" said McGregor about the news that Paulie Malignaggi wants to fight him next in a boxing match. \"He got his [expletive] whopped (in sparring).\"\n\nMalignaggi is making a career out of talking about McGregor and having him respond to him. Malignaggi has never had this kind of a spotlight put on him for this long of a time in his own career in boxing. Malignaggi's fights were more as him as the B-side opponent for Adrien Broner, Ricky Hatton, Danny Garcia and Miguel Cotto. Now he's getting a lot of attention by the casual boxing and MMA fans by him name dropping McGregor's name night and day on Twitter and in interviews with different news outlets.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how much longer Malignaggi's 15 minutes of fame will last. He keeps talking nonstop about McGregor months from now, it's going to look wretched and more than a little pathetic. But if it helps Malignaggi's career, I guess you can't blame him for name dropping the way he's been doing. As far as Malignaggi getting a fight against McGregor, it's not going to happen. McGregor told Malignaggi to get in line if he wants to fight him. Believe me; there's very, very long line of fighters waiting for a chance to fight McGregor. Unfortunately, McGregor will probably never fight Malignaggi. It just won't happen. Malignaggi brings nothing to the table in terms of ability and popularity. Malignaggi is mainly popular now due to him being McGregor's sparring partner for a brief amount of time.\n\n\"Right now we're focused on putting him away on Aug. 26, and then we'll see what happens,\" said McGregor when asked about a potential rematch with Mayweather.\n\nThis is exact same thing that Mayweather said when he was asked if he'll be fighting McGregor again. Mayweather is taking a wait and see approach to the fight. Obviously, Mayweather wants to see if the fight brings in a massive amount of PPV buys like the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight did. If the mega-fight brings in 4.6 million buys or more, you can bet that Mayweather will elect to fight McGregor in a rematch in the octagon. That's only place a rematch between McGregor and Mayweather can take place.\n\nMcGregor said he's not happy with the \"disrespect and disregard\" for his boxing skills from the fans, who see him as not having any real ability in the sport. The fans have watched McGregor workout and noted how unorthodox he is when throwing punches, and moving around the ring. It's understandable for the fans to conclude from watching McGregor that he's totally unskilled and unprepared experience-wise for what he's going to be dealing with when he gets inside the ring with Mayweather.", "id": "9624926", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "McGregor: I'm ready to KO Mayweather in 10 seconds \" Boxing News", "image": "http://www.boxingnews24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1-102_Conor_McGregor_Workout.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 537, "amb": false, "textEnd": 546, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Game"}, "id": "302616", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "A-side and B-side"}, "id": "338035", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-side_and_B-side"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slug"}, "id": "343139", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrien Broner"}, "id": "350918", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Broner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miguel Cotto"}, "id": "364282", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Cotto"}, {"label": {"eng": "15 minutes of fame"}, "id": "394711", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_minutes_of_fame"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ricky Hatton"}, "id": "427870", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Hatton"}, {"label": {"eng": "Danny Garc\u00eda"}, "id": "450635", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Garc\u00eda"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "1278946", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr._vs._Manny_Pacquiao"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 169, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1157, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Furry", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Furry"}], "time": "05:59:00"}

The lighter gloves will help McGregor out, lessening the six-ounce adjustment from UFC gloves down to four. This may allow him to keep the hand speed that has won him so much success in MMA. But the lighter gloves also give Mayweather, who has some of the fastest hands in boxing, even more speed. Who does it help more?\n\nFloyd Mayweather just did something he rarely does -- he let an opponent control fight conditions. After weeks of goading, Mayweather agreed to allow the use of eight-ounce gloves in his fight with Conor McGregor. It isn't hard to imagine McGregor doing cartwheels when the news broke.\n\nLighter gloves mean McGregor's adjustment to boxing will be easier. The difference of two-ounces will allow his hands to move quicker, and show off the knockout power he had in the UFC. McGregor had an outside shot of competing with Mayweather in 10-ounce gloves. Now, he has a chance of winning.\n\nI am impressed, Floyd. You followed through on your offer to wear 8-oz gloves. But you let McGregor goad you into a dangerous disadvantage. -- Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nPeople act like Conor McGregor is going to use eight-ounce gloves, and Floyd Mayweather is going to stick with the 10-ounce mitts. No, Mayweather will get to use the eight-ounce gloves too, and now he is going to be even better than he was before.\n\nMayweather is a defensive boxer who uses his hands a lot to set up his opponents. Now imagine that defense with lighter gloves where he can really show off the elite hand speed that got him to 49-0. Mayweather has less weight to carry, so he can easily pepper McGregor with more shots than before. The best boxer in the world just got better.\n\nChill, McGregor fans: 8-Ounce gloves give him no extra advantage\n\nFunny McGregor thinks 8oz benefits him more...Floyd spent most of his career in 8oz. -- Chad Maddox (@chadmaddox11)\n\nAugust 17, 2017", "id": "9795554", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Who benefits more from 8-ounce gloves: Floyd Mayweather or Conor McGregor?", "image": "http://image.gulflive.com/home/gulflive-media/width620/img/mississippi-press/photo/2017/07/11/23062629-large.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1318, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1333}, {"textStart": 2111, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2126}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Punching power"}, "id": "420928", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punching_power"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Skip Bayless"}, "id": "508883", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Bayless"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "23:03:00"}

Representatives of both fighters appeared before the Nevada State Athletic Commission to request the waiver.\n\nCommissioners also approved veteran referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring for the fight.\n\nCommission Chairman Anthony Marnell said he was comfortable with the fighters using smaller gloves, but unhappy that they used the issue to sell the fight on social media.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\n\"I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media battle,\" Marnell said.\n\nUnder Nevada regulations, 10-ounce gloves are required in fights above 147 pounds and the bout is set for 154 pounds. But Mayweather has worn 8-ounce gloves most of his career, and McGregor has worn 4-ounce gloves in his UFC fights.\n\nMcGregor said the gloves will only speed up the end of the fight, which he earlier predicted wouldn't last four rounds.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said his fighter is also more comfortable in smaller gloves and would use them to stop McGregor.\n\n\"The fight is going to end in a knockout, I'm very confident,\" Ellerbe said. \"And it will probably be early.\"\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nMcGregor will be in a boxing ring for the first time as a pro when he takes on Mayweather, who is coming out of retirement for a fight that will make him tens of millions of dollars. They will fight under boxing rules, which will be enforced by Byrd, a veteran of many championship fights.\n\n\"The referee makes a big difference in this fight, which is the specific reason I chose Robert Byrd,\" said Bob Bennett, the commission's executive director.\n\nCommissioners also approved Burt Clements and Dave Moretti of the United States and Italy's Guido Cavalleri as judges for the bout. McGregor's camp had asked for an international judge among the three.\n\nByrd will be paid $25,000 for the bout, while the judges will make $20,000.\n\nThe glove issue took up much of the commission meeting, though in the end all voted in favor of the smaller gloves. There was also discussion about the padding in the gloves, with both sides agreeing to be bound by Nevada boxing inspectors approving the foam padding.\n\nMayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves, including his last six. McGregor has never boxed before, but quickly agreed to Mayweather's challenge on social media to fight in smaller gloves.\n\nUFC chief Dana White echoed McGregor in saying the smaller gloves will make a difference in the fight.\n\n\"It affects the fight big time,\" White said. \"When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don't know what changed but I'm glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.\"\n\nCommissioners said they struggled with making an exception to regulations in place since 2006, but decided to approve the waiver because of the unusual nature of the event.\n\n\"The fight is not normal,\" said commissioner Sandra Morgan.\n\nJohn Hornewer, an attorney for Mayweather, said the unbeaten boxer would likely not be at the 154-pound limit at the fight weigh-in anyway.\n\n\"He'll be 150 pounds. That's his best weight and there's no reason to put on extra weight,\" Hornewer said.\n\nA McGregor representative said his fighter has been about 160 pounds in training camp and would likely enter the ring somewhere around that weight after making the 154-pound limit the day before.", "id": "9574276", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Mayweather and McGregor will fight in smaller

Clements, Dave Moretti and Italy's Guido Cavalerri as judges.\n\nByrd previously worked Mayweather's one-sided and uneventful victory by unanimous decision over Robert Guerrero in May 2013.\n\nThis bout is expected to be a far greater challenge for the referee, considering that McGregor is making his pro boxing debut and the possibility that he could turn to the rougher fighting techniques employed in the UFC.\n\nThe decision on the gloves came after both fighters lobbied for a change from a 2006 rule that stipulates fights above 154 pounds should be contested with 10-ounce gloves. McGregor has said he will likely weigh as much as 170 pounds on fight night.\n\nOne commissioner, Skip Avansino, said despite the fact that \"that's the rule,\" there has been no scientific study on why 10-ounce gloves are needed for 154-pound fights, and said an adjustment can be \"reconsidered by this unprecedented fight.\"\n\nChairman Anthony Marnell III said, \"My biggest concern is I don't like the Nevada commission being used as a pawn in a social-media battle,\" that occurred between the two fighters. \"If you cut a deal for a fight with this much money, you should get it right.\"\n\nMarnell said he wanted commissioners to screen the gloves as part of launching a new study to consider if 8-ounce gloves can be used in future 154-pound fights.\n\nMcGregor wanted gloves nearer in size to the 4-ounce gloves he uses as a UFC fighter, believing his punching power will be more effective.\n\n\"I'm strong enough to give him two rounds,\" in eight-ounce gloves, McGregor said. \"The only reason [Mayweather] can get to the second round is because in this game the referee gives him time to recover [with an eight-count] without getting his head pounded into the canvas. That's the only reason he might make it to the second round.\"\n\nIn the fight contract, Mayweather requested \"no Mexican-made gloves, no gloves made of horsehair, only 10-ounce. I didn't even know the difference,\" McGregor said. \"I didn't really care. Now he's pushing for the 8-ounce. Great.\"\n\nMayweather has said the 8-ounce gloves will give him more punching power, as well, which could enhance his chances of posting his first knockout victory since 2011.\n\nMcGregor's representative said at Wednesday's meeting that he believes \"there is no inherent risk to the health and safety\" of the Irishman by fighting Mayweather in 8-ounce gloves. The representative said McGregor has trained exclusively in 10-ounce gloves.\n\nThe McGregor representative said the gloves will not be Mexican-made or contain any horsehair.\n\nNevada Commissioner J. Daniel Carpenter, said, \"We want great entertainment, but we want the health and safety of the fighters, first and foremost,\" noting a recent MMA fighter's death, but also expressing trust in a referee like Byrd to stop punishment that could endanger either fighter.\n\n\"This is a hybrid fight. An individual who's never stepped foot in a boxing ring against one of the best ... boxers ever.\"\n\nIf the fight goes the distance, the outcome will be decided by the judges, including Moretti, who's judged 10 Mayweather fights since 2005.\n\nMoretti has been favorable to Mayweather in two of his most compelling bouts, awarding him a wide 118-110 (10 rounds to two) advantage in the record-setting 2015 bout against Manny Pacquiao, and giving Mayweather eight rounds in what was seen as a more narrow decision over Marcos Maidana in their first 2014 fight.\n\nCavalerri was added to

Mayweather and McGregor's Showtime pay-per-view superfight on August 27 will be contested at the junior middleweight limit of 154 pounds.\n\nHowever, both fighters submitted official requests to the commission stating their desire to compete in smaller, eight-ounce gloves.\n\nIn a shocking decision, the NSAC agreed to the fighters' request and granted an exception to its own rule.\n\nCommission chairman Anthony Marnell said he was comfortable with the fighters using smaller gloves, but unhappy that they used the issue to sell the fight on social media.\n\n\"I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media battle,\" Marnell said.\n\nGlove size has been a constant issue in the long war of words between Mayweather and McGregor.\n\nFrom the beginning, McGregor has been pushing for the smallest gloves possible because smaller gloves have less padding and thus accentuate his significant punching power. McGregor has made a name for himself in the UFC with showstopping knockouts delivered with the sport's traditional four-ounce gloves.\n\nMayweather, goaded by McGregor's taunts, publicly stated that he'd be fine with the smaller gloves, safe in the knowledge that Nevada's own rules would assuredly protect him.\n\nMcGregor, who is also known for making wild predictions about his fights that often end up being true, said Friday that the eight-ounce gloves would be the end of Mayweather.\n\n\"If we're eight ounces, I'm struggling to give him two rounds,\" McGregor said at his media workout. \"That's the God's honest truth. The only reason I maybe give him two rounds is because in this game, the referee stops me from pounding his head into the canvas. And he has 10 seconds to recover. That's the only reason he might get to the second round.\"\n\nThe NSAC decision came despite strong advice to the contrary from the Association of Ringside Physicians.\n\n\"Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of this bout, we would strongly caution against allowing current regulation to be overruled,\" wrote the Association's Chairman, Dr Raymond M. Monsell, in a letter to the NSAC.\n\n\"To do so would also set a precedent for future bouts.\"\n\nMayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said his fighter is more comfortable in smaller gloves and would use them to stop McGregor.\n\n\"The fight is going to end in a knockout, I'm very confident,\" Ellerbe said. \"And it will probably be early.\"\n\nCommissioners also approved veteran referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring for the fight.\n\n\"The referee makes a big difference in this fight, which is the specific reason I chose Robert Byrd,\" said Bob Bennett, the commission's executive director. Commissioners also approved Burt Clements and Dave Moretti of the United States and Italy's Guido Cavalleri as judges for the bout. McGregor's camp had asked for an international judge among the three.\n\nByrd will be paid $25,000 for the bout, while the judges will make $20,000. The glove issue took up much of the commission meeting, though in the end all voted in favour of the smaller gloves. There was also discussion about the padding in the gloves, with both sides agreeing to be bound by Nevada boxing inspectors approving the foam padding.\n\nMayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves, including his last six. McGregor has never boxed before, but quickly agreed to Mayweather's challenge on social media to fight in smaller gloves.", "id": "9573832", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Shock rule switch for McGregor-Mayweather", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d944d60fda0a7028761cd87f9ae61565", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 327, "date": "2017-08-27", "amb": false, "textEnd": 336}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}, "id": "303670", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mass media"}, "id": "304234", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Light middleweight"}, "id": "315817", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_middleweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Punching power"}, "id": "420928", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punching_power"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marnell Corrao Associates"}, "id": "1347532", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnell_Corrao_Associates"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 898, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation"}], "time": "22:16:00"}

They will fight under boxing rules, which will be enforced by Byrd, a veteran of many championship fights.\n\n\"The referee makes a big difference in this fight, which is the specific reason I chose Robert Byrd,\" said Bob Bennett, the commission's executive director.\n\nCommissioners also approved Burt Clements and Dave Moretti of the United States and Italy's Guido Cavalleri as judges for the bout.

Mayweather and McGregor will fight at 154 pounds, but both signed waivers and wanted to use the smaller gloves. McGregor has used 4-ounce gloves -- which are little more than knuckle protectors -- during his career in mixed martial arts, while Mayweather has spent most of his career using 8-ounce gloves.\n\nThe NSAC says this will be a one-time exception to its glove size rule, and that it was allowed because this is a \"unique\" matchup. Also on Wednesday, veteran official Robert Byrd was appointed to oversee the bout in the ring.\n\nThe smaller gloves certainly favor McGregor in the fight, but it doesn't change the fact that he'll be an overwhelming underdog. Mayweather is used to 8-ounce gloves, and while the UFC lightweight champion's power could be a factor, it almost certainly won't change the expected outcome.\n\nMayweather might be 40, but he's been boxing virtually his entire life. McGregor is in his first professional bout. Glove size won't have anything to do with the anticipated outcome of a wide decision for Mayweather. \"Money May\" is too good at avoiding punishment and is so smart in the ring he should run circles around McGregor.\n\nWednesday's news on glove size was surprising, but shouldn't have any appreciable impact on the fight.", "id": "9565982", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Floyd Mayweather, Conor McGregor To Wear 8-Ounce Gloves In Megafight", "image": "https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-812856518.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 183, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 192}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 947, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "21:16:00"}

Coverage will start at 11am (AEST) with the main card loosely scheduled for 5pm (AEST).\n\nHere's the full breakdown for each Australian time zone:\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor start time in NSW: 11am (AEST)\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor start time in Victoria: 11am (AEST)\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor start time in Tasmania: 11am (AEST)\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor start time in ACT: 11am (AEST)\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor start time in Queensland: 11am (AEST)\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor start time in Northern Territory: 10:30am (AEST)\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor start time in Western Australia: 9am (AEST)\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor start time in South Australia : 10:30am (AEST)\n\nImage: Getty Images Where is the Mayweather Vs McGregor fight being held?\n\nThe Mayweather Vs McGregor fight will be held at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nHow to watch Mayweather Vs McGregor on TV\n\nThe Mayweather Vs McGregor fight will be shown on the Pay-Per-View channel Main Event. Paying customers will be able to follow the action on their large screen TVs via the Foxtel app or Fetch TV.\n\nHow to watch Mayweather Vs McGregor online\n\nIf you don't have access to a smart TV, the aforementioned Pay-Per-View can be accessed on a computer or tablet. You can also purchase the fight on UFC TV.\n\nHow to watch Mayweather Vs McGregor at the pub\n\nYou can rest assured that sports venues around the country will be showing the Mayweather Vs McGregor fight on the biggest commercial TV screens that money can buy. Here are all the bars and pubs that will be showing the Mayweather Vs McGregor live. (Type in your postcode to find the closest venue to your location.).\n\nHow to watch Mayweather Vs McGregor for free Image: YouTube\n\nThe only legal way to watch the Mayweather Vs McGregor fight without paying is to head down the pub (see above.) With that said, Australia is a nation of ex-convicts... and convicts find a way.\n\nOne option is to trawl the internet on August 27 for a cheeky broadcast on Facebook Live. This is precisely what happened during the Anthony Mundine Vs Danny Green pay-per-view boxing match back in February. Darren Sharpe, a mechanic from Brisbane, ended up getting 112,000 viewers piggybacking off his Facebook Live stream of the fight.\n\nNeedless to say, Foxtel was not amused, but it did not pursue the matter legally. Sharpe was eventually forced to issue a public apology for breaking copyright law, but that was all he copped. Meanwhile, none of the people who watched the stream were punished in any way.\n\nJust be aware that this is a pretty risky way to watch the fight - if a Facebook Live stream does appear, it will be of the handheld, bootleg variety and the broadcast could be shut down at any second. Also, it's clearly an extremely dodgy thing to partake in. (For those interested, you can read up on the legalities of Facebook Live event streaming here.)\n\nHow to watch Mayweather Vs McGregor live\n\nPlanning a trip to Vegas? Getting into the venue won't be cheap: ringside tickets will set you back over $11,000 (!), while the cheapest available seats are still in the region of fifteen-hundred bucks. You can purchase tickets on ticketmaster. (We advise not gambling at the casino too - nobody has that much money.)\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor: Fight rules\n\nThe Mayweather Vs McGregor fight will follow boxing rules, comprising 12 three-minute rounds at 154 pounds with eight-ounce gloves. (Yes, this means McGregor will not be able to use any of his MMA moves, with the exception of legal punching blows.)\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor: Fighter stats Mayweather McGregor Record Boxing: 49-0 (28 KOs) MMA: 21-3 (18 KOs) Height 5'8\" (172cm) 5'9\" (175cm) Weight 154lb (70kg) 154lb (70kg) Style Orthodox Southpaw Reach 72 inches 74 inches Age 40 29\n\nAs you can see, Mayweather has a significant height, reach and age disadvantage, but his 49-0 boxing record speaks for itself. McGregor is very much the underdog here. With that said, self-belief goes a long way and McGregor has this in spades.\n\nMayweather Vs McGregor: Betting Odds\n\nWe do not encourage gambling at Lifehacker, but if you're going to risk your hard-earned cash on the outcome of a sports match, it might as well be for something outlandish and crazy like this.\n\nHere are the current odds from TAB for various outcomes:\n\nMayweather: $1.25\n\nMayweather by KO/TKO: $1.80\n\nMayweather by decision/tech decision: $4\n\nMcGregor: $4\n\nMcGregor by KO/TKO: $5.50\n\nMcGregor Wins in Round 1: $17\n\nMcGregor by decision/tech decision: $21\n\nMayweather Wins in Round 1: $21\n\nMcGregor Wins in Round 2: $21\n\nDraw: $26\n\nThe safe money is on a head-to-head Mayweather victory, but at odds of $1.18 it's hardly worth the risk. If you're going to take a punt, go full madman and back a McGregor KO in round 2. This will give you a nice 20x return on whatever you put down. (For what it's worth, the Irishman has vowed to knock Mayweather out inside two rounds and most experts agree that if McGregor is going to win he will need to do it early.) A more conservative bet is a Mayweather victory by decision, which is currently sitting at $4.\n\nWhat is a Mayweather Vs McGregor?\n\nIf you're scratching your head about all this but want to be part of the conversation, we got you: here is your Complete Bluffer's Guide to Mayweather Vs McGregor.\n\nThe Bluffer's Guide To Mayweather Vs McGregor\n\nIt's the 'fight of the century'.

McGregor says Mayweather is hoping that he'll wear down in the fight as the rounds go by, but he doesn't plan on letting that happen.\n\nMcGregor, 29, it's going to be the 40-year-old Mayweather (49-0, 26 KOs) who winds up fatiguing from the fast pace that he's going to be setting for him in their fight on Showtime pay-per-view at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe 8oz gloves that both fighters will be wearing for the fight will favor McGregor, who is the naturally bigger puncher than Mayweather. The odds for the Mayweather-McGregor fight have narrowed due to the smaller gloves size. Mayweather is favored by the odds -550, and McGregor +425.\n\nMcGregor isn't just talking about wanting to fight at a fast pace against Mayweather. He actually means what he says. If you saw the sparring video of McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi, you'll have noticed that McGregor was all over Malignaggi, not giving him a second to rest and hitting him constantly with punches. There was virtually no letup from McGregor, even when he was on the inside. McGregor continued to hammer away at Malignaggi with short punches o the head that made him not want to hold. Mayweather is 40, and he's no used to fighting without holding and resting with his back against the ropes. If Mayweather fights like that against McGregor, it could be his undoing.\n\n\"Floyd is praying for me to fatigue in there, but I will not fatigue. I will continue to press forward, and I will break him. At 40 years of age, he will not sustain my pace,\" said McGregor to 'Conan on TBS.' \"We've made slight adjustments in my cardio preparation. It's actually been very enjoyable to go from five, five-minute rounds, which is what we're used to, which is 25 minutes, to 12, three-minute rounds of boxing, which is 36 minutes. Slight adjustments, but we are more than ready. I done 12 rounds last night, I've done multiple 12-round fights in the gym in the lead-up to this. We are more than ready,\" said McGregor.\n\nA fast pace fight favors McGregor, because he's the younger guy and the more active of the two. McGregor's fights in the octagon are generally always fast pace affairs with a lot of fireworks. In contrast, Mayweather has fought a lot of slow paced fights in recent years against Manny Pacquiao, Andre Berto and Marcos Maidana. Even Mayweather's fight against Saul Canelo Alvarez in 2013 was a slow-paced fight. Canelo stayed on the outside and boxed Mayweather, and let him fight at a slow pace. It was a mistake on Canelo's part and it cost him the fight.\n\nMayweather will likely have trained to stay in the center of the ring for as long as possible against McGregor. I don't know if Mayweather can do that. Mayweather has ALWAYS fought with his back against the ropes during his career. He likes to cover up, rest his legs, and throw short punches with his back leaning against the ropes. Most of the guys that Mayweather has fought during his career have been head hunters that ignored his body. This has made Mayweather's job much easier, since he hasn't had to worry about getting hit to the body. McGregor has a chance of wearing Mayweather down with body shots if he gets him against the ropes. McGregor also could hurt Mayweather with head shots if he gets him against the ropes. McGregor will take the power off his shots and slap with them.\n\n\"I'm going down in the history books, Conan. I've dominated the UFC and I will dominate boxing also. It has never been done. That's where I'm going, down in the history books,\" said McGregor. \"There will be no dancing in there, Conan. I'm going to go straightforward and put him away inside four rounds.\"\n\nIt would be a sad ending to Mayweather's long boxing career if he were to get knocked out by the heavy underdog McGregor. Mayweather has won so many fights during his career and looked invincible most of the time. That's what happens with old fighters that stay out of the ring for 2 or more years. When they come back, they frequently get beaten badly by younger fighters. We saw that with Sugar Ray Leonard in his loss to Hector Camacho. Leonard tried to come back 1 time too many, and it cost him dearly in losing by a knockout.\n\nMayweather hasn't looked that great in the ring for some time. He took a lot of rounds off against Andre Berto, Manny Pacquiao and Marcos Maidana. Mayweather doesn't seem capable of fighting hard for a full 12 rounds. He fights hard for 6 rounds, and wins because his opponents are so bad. McGregor will have a chance of outworking and maybe even stopping Mayweather if he doesn't want to fight hard in this fight.\n\n\"He's saying he's going to come towards me, I'm saying I'm going to come towards him. We'll find out pretty early who's telling the truth. We'll see who takes a back step first. I will go forward for him and put him away,\" said McGregor.\n\nI don't think you can take what Mayweather says anymore at face value. He says he's going to do something, but then he does the opposite. Mayweather is saying he's going to take the fight to McGreor and knock him out. Are we to believe Mayweather this time or should we ignore what he's saying and judge him by his actions in his past fights? In regular life, we judge the people we associate with on their behavior and actions that they've shown in the past.\n\nIf a person doesn't keep their word, then we stop listening to what they say when they're talking about doing something that is important. Mayweather is saying he's going to go directly at McGregor and knock him out so that he can repay the boxing fans for his lackluster fight against Pacquiao in 2015. Are we to believe Mayweather or judge him by what he's done in the past?\n\nMcGregor will come at Mayweather on August 26 and look to knock him out. We know this because that's how McGregor always fights in the octagon. He goes after his opponents, and he doesn't play it safe no matter which it is he's fighting. McGregor feels really confident in fighting with the 8oz gloves. He thinks he'll hurt Mayweather and knock him out quickly with those gloves.

Mayweather had begun a public campaign on social media to wear smaller gloves, in response to claims the decorated boxer had insisted on wearing larger gloves.\n\nAll this played into the narrative that McGregor would crush Mayweather in a MMA fight, which of course, would involve 4-ounce gloves (and a myriad of fighting techniques...).\n\nWell, today the NSAC ruled on the request and they have signed off on 8-ounce gloves, despite significant cautions from the Association of Ringside Physicians (quote via MMA Fighting):\n\n\"Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of the bout, we should strongly caution against allowing current regulations to be over-ruled,\" ARP board chairman Dr. Raymond Monsell wrote in the aforementioned state. \"To do so would also set a precedent for future bouts.\"\n\nThe commission, apparently, wasn't all smiles about the situation either.

In an interview with FightHype on the worldwide adulation McGregor had received for knocking out Aldo in just 13 seconds, the American complained that he would never receive such acclaim from the public because of the colour of his skin.\n\n\"They say he talk a lot of trash and people praise him for it, but when I did it, they say I'm cocky and arrogant,\" Mayweather observed.\n\n\"So biased! Like I said before, all I'm saying is this, I ain't racist at all, but I'm telling you racism still exists.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\n4/18 \"I am an Irishman\"\n\nThis time, it didn't take the other man the best part of half a year to respond. \"Don't ever bring my race into my success again,\" McGregor commented in a long Instagram post, the very next day.\n\n\"I am an Irishman. My people have been oppressed our entire existence. And still very much are. I understand the feeling of prejudice. It is a feeling that is deep in my blood ...

I will give you a fair 80/20 split purse in my favour seen as your last fight bombed at every area of revenue.\"\n\nA feud was born.\n\n5/18 McGregor 'retires'\n\nAs interest in a fight with Mayweather began to increase, McGregor threatened to retire not just from MMA, but from sport altogether.\n\nUFC president Dana White announced that the promotion has pulled McGregor from the main event at UFC 200, because of his refusal to participate in mandatory media duties. McGregor's response?\n\n\"I have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya's later.\"\n\n6/18 Scoop\n\nThings came to a boil in May 2016. British tabloid The Sun reported that the two men were \"on the verge\" of agreeing to a deal, with an unnamed source telling the paper that \"Floyd is obsessed with making Conor eat his words\".\n\nThe story attracted so much attention that Dana White, the president of the UFC, felt compelled to finally address the situation. He laughed off suggestions the super-fight would ever take place, instead pointing out that McGregor was contracted to the UFC, and would thus be in breach of contract should he attempt to organise a fight himself away from the confines of the Octagon.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\n7/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters\n\nWhite's comments appeared to spur both men into action. First McGregor tweeted a mocked up fight poster with the caption 'MMA vs Boxing'...\n\nGetty Images\n\n8/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters\n\n... before Mayweather responded with an effort of his own (it wasn't quite as good).\n\nMayweather insisted began to insist a fight was \"possible\". Then he told a journalist that he was a retired man and would only countenance returning to professional sport in order to fight McGregor. And then he pressed the nuclear button, offering the Irishman just $50m to fight him in what people were already describing as a billion-dollar bout.\n\nGetty Images\n\n9/18 Leonard Ellerbe puts his foot down\n\nHold the hype. Just as things were beginning to heat up, Mayweather's promotions head, Leonard Ellerbe, poured cold water on the prospective fight, insisting it was \"a calculated effort by McGregor to gain more fans\".\n\nGetty Images\n\n10/18 Mac gets personal\n\nIn an attempt to get discussions back on track, McGregor got personal.\n\n\"Call me CJ Watson!\" he tweet, with a cartoon of him standing triumphantly above a knocked out Mayweather.\n\nThe caption was explosive: Mayweather was sent to prison in 2010 for the assault of his then-girlfriend. He was reportedly angry about text messages she had received from NBA star CJ Watson.\n\nGetty Images\n\n11/18 White rebuffed\n\nAt this point in the saga the president of the UFC, Dana White, reenters the fray.\n\nHaving previously insisted that the fight was a non-starter, he suddenly proposed a deal: $25m for each fighter, with the complicated PPV splits to be patiently worked out at a later date.\n\n\"He's a f***ing comedian,\" Mayweather replied.\n\nGetty Images\n\n12/18 In February 2017...\n\n... McGregor arrived in Las Vegas, to much excitement.\n\nMayweather tweeted the following.\n\nGetty Images\n\n13/18 Conor's response\n\nMcGregor's response to Mayweather's short statement was brutal and to the point.\n\n\"I am in Las Vegas. Floyd has retired on my arrival,\" he observed.\n\n14/18 Conan's back!\n\nWithout Conan O'Brien the biggest fight in the history of boxing would still be a daydream.\n\nIn March he invited Dana White onto his show, who said the following.\n\n\"I do think it's gonna happen. I think it's going to be a tough deal because obviously [there are] a lot of egos involved in this deal and a lot of people, so that always makes it tougher.\n\n\"On the flip side, there's so much money involved. I just don't see how it doesn't happen.\"\n\n15/18 Conor and Conlan\n\nMcGrgor was in New York to support Belfast boxer Michael Conlan in his professional debut against Tim Ibarra in March.\n\nBut the spotlight quickly sought him out. He reminded everyone that an announcement was imminent by shouting furiously into the face of ESPN boxing reporter Dan Rafael: \"I AM BOXING!\"\n\nGetty Images\n\n16/18 Fine downgraded\n\nOn March 22, an outstanding fine McGregor had with the Nevada Athletic Commission was downgraded, paving the way for the Irishman to obtain his necessary boxing license.\n\nGetty Images\n\n17/18 McGregor confirms\n\nOn Wednesday 14 June, the fight was finally confirmed by both men.\n\n\"THE FIGHT IS ON,\" McGregor posted on Twitter, along with a mocking picture of himself side-by-side with Floyd Mayweather Snr.\n\n18/18 Mayweather confirms\n\n\"It's official!\" replied Mayweather on Instagram, along with a short promotional video confirming the involvement of Showtime.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\nRead more Mayweather vows to retire after McGregor fight because of his children\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago. Of course not,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago. I'm, not even the same Floyd Mayweather that I was I was five or two years ago.\n\n\"But I still have a high IQ in that ring. And experience wise, it leans towards me, period, because I have been in the ring at such a high level for so long.\"\n\nMore about: UFC Floyd Mayweather Conor McGregor Mayweather vs McGregor Andre Berto Oscar De La Hoya Ricky Hatton Wladimir Klitschko Juan Manuel Marquez Reuse content", "id": "9868573", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Reflective Mayweather says he's putting it all on the line vs McGregor", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/18/10/floyd-mayweather-f.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 7714, "date": "-06-14", "amb": false, "textEnd": 7721}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1240, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1247}, {"textStart": 7494, "date": "-03-22", "amb": false, "textEnd": 7502}, {"textStart": 2212, "date": "2015-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2221}, {"textStart": 4016, "date": "2016-05-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4024}, {"textStart": 6360, "date": "2017-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 6373}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "91866", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}, "id": "302665", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}, "id": "304131", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association"}, {"label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}, "id": "305090", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "id": "305867", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trash-talk"}, "id": "325883", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash-talk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conan O'Brien"}, "id": "478726", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_O'Brien"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rocky Marciano"}, "id": "521934", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Marciano"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "C.

But Mayweather has worn 8-ounce gloves most of his career, and McGregor has worn 4-ounce gloves in his UFC fights.\n\nMcGregor said the gloves will only speed up the end of the fight, which he earlier predicted wouldn't last four rounds.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said his fighter is also more comfortable in smaller gloves and would use them to stop McGregor.\n\n\"The fight is going to end in a knockout, I'm very confident,\" Ellerbe said. \"And it will probably be early.\"\n\nMcGregor will be in a boxing ring for the first time as a pro when he takes on Mayweather, who is coming out of retirement for a fight that will make him tens of millions of dollars. They will fight under boxing rules, which will be enforced by Byrd, a veteran of many championship fights.\n\n\"The referee makes a big difference in this fight, which is the specific reason I chose Robert Byrd,\" said Bob Bennett, the commission's executive director.\n\nCommissioners also approved Burt Clements and Dave Moretti of the United States and Italy's Guido Cavalleri as judges for the bout. McGregor's camp had asked for an international judge among the three.\n\nByrd will be paid $25,000 for the bout, while the judges will make $20,000.\n\nThe glove issue took up much of the commission meeting, though in the end all voted in favor of the smaller gloves. There was also discussion about the padding in the gloves, with both sides agreeing to be bound by Nevada boxing inspectors approving the foam padding.\n\nMayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves, including his last six. McGregor has never boxed before, but quickly agreed to Mayweather's challenge on social media to fight in smaller gloves.\n\nUFC chief Dana White echoed McGregor in saying the smaller gloves will make a difference in the fight.\n\n\"It affects the fight big time,\" White said. \"When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don't know what changed but I'm glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.\"\n\nCommissioners said they struggled with making an exception to regulations in place since 2006, but decided to approve the waiver because of the unusual nature of the event.\n\n\"The fight is not normal,\" said commissioner Sandra Morgan.\n\nJohn Hornewer, an attorney for Mayweather, said the unbeaten boxer would likely not be at the 154-pound limit at the fight weigh-in anyway.\n\n\"He'll be 150 pounds. That's his best weight and there's no reason to put on extra weight,\" Hornewer said.\n\nA McGregor representative said his fighter has been about 160 pounds in training camp and would likely enter the ring somewhere around that weight after making the 154-pound limit the day before.", "id": "9608688", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Mayweather and McGregor will fight in smaller gloves", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 168, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 175}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}, "id": "303670", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coming out"}, "id": "308019", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}, "id": "387933", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns"}, "id": "826804", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Ray_Leonard_vs._Thomas_Hearns"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marnell Corrao Associates"}, "id": "1347532", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marnell_Corrao_Associates"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sandra Morgan"}, "id": "1355243", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Morgan"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}], "time": "04:17:00"}

The change could improve McGregor's odds and make him more comfortable in his first attempt in the boxing ring.\n\nThe odds could shift in Conor's favor due to this latest change.\n\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission has overturned it's own rules regarding the glove size yesterday. The two opponents will now be using 8-ounce gloves in the fight instead of 10-ounce gloves. Accordingly, \"all fighters over 147 pounds must wear 10-ounce gloves.\" The super fight will be at the 154 pound pound limit.\n\nBoth Floyd and Conor submitted their waivers to contest the glove size and it has been accepted. The committee will be granting an exception for this single fight. McGregor has been pushing for a smaller glove size for the fight in the promotions between the two earlier in the summer. The two greatly insulted each other hilariously in the promotions leading up to the match.\n\nFloyd Mayweather was also pushing for lighter gloves to help out his opponent.\n\nHe even posted a picture on his Instagram account to describe it.\n\nMcGregor has gotten his wish, but will now have to back it up by knocking him out sooner with lighter gloves. McGregor is one to talk a lot and he is very confident in his abilities. He even stated that \"8-ounce gloves would be the end of Mayweather.\"\n\nConor McGregor does have a chance in the ring. He has certain advantages over Floyd with respect to age, energy, and power. The recent change gives McGregor more of a chance in the ring against the undefeated boxer. The Irishman is used to fighting in lighter gloves.\n\nThe lighter gloves will help out Conor because he will be able to put his punching power on full display. McGregor has been known for knocking out opponents in light gloves in the UFC. Although, the gloves he uses in those matches are the traditional 4-ounce gloves. The 8-ounce gloves certainly help because it is less padding that in turn makes punches more effective.\n\nAll eyes will be set on the match debut on August 26.

Floyd Mayweather Jr., too, because it likely means more sales for what could be the richest fight ever.\n\nNevada boxing regulators went out of their way to give a gift to both fighters, approving an exemption to the rule requiring 10-ounce gloves for the 154-pound fight so that both fighters can wear 8-ounce gloves.\n\nAnd just like that, the fight appeared more competitive -- at least to some.\n\nOddsmaker William Hill immediately boosted the odds of McGregor winning, though they are still low. And UFC chief Dana White didn't wait long to trumpet the smaller gloves as a game changer.\n\n\"It affects the fight big time,\" White said. \"When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don't know what changed but I'm glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.\"\n\nThe underlying school of thought is that McGregor will have a better chance of knocking Mayweather out with smaller gloves, though Mayweather has fought all but three of his professional fights with 8-ounce gloves and has never been knocked out.\n\nBut the fight needed another selling point, and Nevada State Athletic Commission members were happy to give it one.\n\n\"It's an unusual contest for us as a commission,\" said Chairman Anthony Marnell.\n\nUnusual, well, yes. The fight matches a UFC champion in his first professional boxing match against a fighter who was throwing punches before he could walk and who won all 49 of his pro fights before announcing his retirement.\n\nCommission members -- who regulate both UFC and boxing in Nevada -- are charged with protecting the health and safety of fighters. Their No. 1 job is to make sure as few fighters as possible get their brains scrambled in the ring or in the octagon.\n\nAnd in this case, they failed.\n\nIt was bad enough that the commission approved a novice boxer to go 12 rounds with one of the best fighters of all time, no questions asked. But commission members lost any remaining credibility when they agreed to change the glove size for no real reason other than the two fighters asked for it.\n\nIn doing so, they ignored a letter from the Association of Ringside Physicians asking them not to.\n\n\"We hated to see them break their own rules and regulations kind of arbitrarily,\" said Dr. Larry Lovelace, who heads the association and is also on the Oklahoma State Boxing Commission. \"It seemed almost capricious to change from 10 ounces, which is the prescribed weight of gloves for that weight class.\"\n\nTo be fair, there is no solid medical evidence about the effects of getting hit with smaller gloves. But there was enough anecdotal evidence that the Nevada commission in 2006 adopted regulations that call for 8-ounce gloves in fights 147 pounds or smaller, and 10-ounce gloves for anything above that.\n\nIn the 11 years since, that has been the rule. Until Wednesday, there had been no exceptions.\n\nBut tickets and pay-per-view had to be sold. More people had to be convinced that McGregor actually has a chance in the ring with Mayweather.\n\nAnd convinced they were, at least the ones betting at William Hill. Oddsmakers there lowered the lopsided odds favoring Mayweather from minus-600 to minus-550 because they will be fighting with smaller gloves.\n\nMcGregor himself predicted the smaller gloves would make the night even easier for him.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMost in boxing scoff at that, saying the size of the gloves would only matter if they were both forced to fight in 4-ounce UFC gloves that are open past the knuckle. There's also a school of thought that smaller gloves will actually help Mayweather by making his hands even quicker.\n\nBut by allowing smaller gloves, commission members did more than just try and lure a few more people to Las Vegas next week. They made a decision that, in theory at least, could affect the outcome of the fight.", "id": "9846139", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Lighter glove only adds to the hype", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trumpet"}, "id": "305920", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Octagon"}, "id": "382893", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octagon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Weight class"}, "id": "385813", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 898, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation"}], "time": "07:53:00"}

Per NSAC regulations, any boxing match contested above 147 pounds mandates 10-ounce gloves.\n\nChairman Anthony Marnell, who strongly chastised both camps for using the NSAC as a \"pawn\" for social media controversy to sell tickets, noted that while he holds a strong respect for the commission's rules, it must always \"adopt it to current times.\"\n\nThe issue came to light on Aug. 1, when Mayweather (49-0, 26 KOs) wrote on Facebook: \"Let's fight in 8 oz gloves.\"\n\nMayweather, 40, has fought the majority of his career in 8-ounce gloves. McGregor (21-3), the UFC's lightweight champion, is used to 4-ounce gloves in mixed martial arts.\n\nBoth fighters submitted a waiver to the NSAC this month, requesting the smaller glove size.\n\n\"I'm very happy with how the Nevada State Athletic Commission handled it,\" McGregor said Wednesday after the decision. \"They handled it fairly, and they listened to both requests.\"\n\nAccording to longtime commission member Skip Avansino, the rule for 10-ounce gloves went into effect in 2006, based on the recommendations of an advisory committee. At that time, the committee stated its recommendations were not based on scientific fact and encouraged the NSAC to fund a study on the matter.\n\nThat study is now planned for after Aug. 26. The rule will remain in place for now, with this one-time exception for the Mayweather-McGregor bout.\n\nOne point articulated by Marnell, which every other commission member echoed, is that referee selection is the most important factor in fighter health and safety, particularly in a \"unique\" matchup such as this. During Wednesday's meeting, the NSAC appointed veteran official Robert Byrd to oversee the bout.\n\n\"The No. 1 line of defense is the referee,\" Marnell said. \"It always will be.\"\n\nAnother concern regarding glove selection was the distribution of padding. The bout contracts mandate that foam gloves be used -- and not Mexican horsehair gloves, which are known more as \"puncher's gloves.\"\n\nIn addition to regular inspections, Marnell and other commission members will inspect each fighter's gloves before the fight. Alternative gloves not selected for the bout will be donated to the NSAC's study.\n\nA nonprofit organization dedicated to the health and safety of boxers and mixed martial artists indicated before the ruling that lighter gloves was a bad idea.\n\n\"This is a bout that has already been set [at] a specified weight class,\" Dr. Raymond M. Monsell, chairman of the Association of Ringside Physicians, wrote to the commission on Tuesday. \"Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of this bout, we would strongly caution against allowing current regulations to be overruled. To do so would also set a precedent for future bouts.\"\n\nSpeaking to ESPN late last week, McGregor, 29, predicted he would need only two rounds to dispatch Mayweather if the commission approved 8-ounce gloves.\n\n\"If we are in 8-ounce gloves, he will be floored multiple times in the first round,\" McGregor said. \"I believe first-round KO in 8-ounce gloves. The fact I can't follow through in MMA and pound the head into the canvas and there's a 10-count in boxing, maybe I'll give him second round. But 8-ounce gloves, he will be done in two.\"\n\nShortly after the NSAC's ruling, longtime Mayweather adviser Leonard Ellerbe told ESPN that Mayweather wanted McGregor's confidence to be high going into the fight.\n\n\"Floyd wanted Conor to be as comfortable as possible, so there wouldn't be any excuses,\" Ellerbe said. \"Conor has vowed he'll knock out Floyd in four rounds.

On Wednesday, the Nevada State Athletic Commission made the inquiry a reality.\n\nDuring the NSAC monthly meeting, the use of 8-ounce gloves was unanimously approved by the panel. Since the fight is taking place at 154 pounds, Nevada rules state that any fight that takes place with boxers weighing over 147 pounds, the participants must wear 10-ounce gloves. However, the commission approved the ruling for educational and safety purposes.\n\nThe commission stated that they want to have the gloves following the fight to study the impact of the weight of gloves for safety. Because there was no prior study that had occurred the current weight class to glove weight safety ratio, the panel approved the change less than two weeks away from the biggest fight in combat sports history.\n\nIt was also revealed during the meeting that veteran Robert Byrd will serve as the bout's referee. Byrd has been the third man in important boxing bouts such as Sergey Kovalev and Andre Ward, as well Canelo Alvarez's fight against Miguel Cotto. The judges for the fight will be Burt Clements, Dave Moretti and Guido Cavalerri.\n\nMcGregor had already predicted a knockout over Mayweather inside of four rounds with the gloves being at 10 ounces, but during his open workout in Las Vegas on Friday, the UFC lightweight champion predicted a much shorter night if the NSAC went forward with Wednesday's approval to 8-ounce gloves.\n\n\"If we're 8 ounces, I'm struggling to give him two rounds, and that's the God's honest truth,\"McGregor said. \"The only reason I maybe give him two rounds is because in this game the referee stops me from pounding his head into the canvas, and he has 10 seconds to recover. That's the only reason why he might get to the second round.\"\n\nWe will find out on Aug. 26 whether or not the gloves will make a difference, as the 49-0 Mayweather will welcome McGregor to the professional boxing world at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.", "id": "9597556", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor will officially fight in 8-ounce gloves", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2017/08/830595618-conor-mcgregor-media-workout.jpg.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 213, "amb": false, "textEnd": 220, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andre Ward"}, "id": "358400", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Ward"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sergey Kovalev (boxer)"}, "id": "358401", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Kovalev_(boxer)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez"}, "id": "361148", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa\u00fal_\u00c1lvarez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miguel Cotto"}, "id": "364282", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Cotto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Weight class"}, "id": "385813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 578, "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 579, "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss/Personal Pages", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss/Personal_Pages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "16:22:00"}

The two will fight in a boxing match in Las Vegas on Aug. 26. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nBy Tim Dahlberg, AP Sports Columnist\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- It's only 2 ounces of foam, 4 if you count both hands.\n\nStill, it was enough to make Conor McGregor quite happy. Floyd Mayweather Jr., too, because it likely means more sales for what could be the richest fight ever.\n\nNevada boxing regulators went out of their way to give a gift to both fighters, approving an exemption to the rule requiring 10-ounce gloves for the 154-pound fight so that both fighters can wear 8-ounce gloves.\n\nAnd just like that, the fight appeared more competitive -- at least to some.\n\nOddsmaker William Hill immediately boosted the odds of McGregor winning, though they are still low. And UFC chief Dana White didn't wait long to trumpet the smaller gloves as a game changer.\n\n\"It affects the fight big time,\" White said. \"When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don't know what changed, but I'm glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.\"\n\nThe underlying school of thought is that McGregor will have a better chance of knocking Mayweather out with smaller gloves, though Mayweather has fought all but three of his professional fights with 8-ounce gloves and has never been knocked out in any of them.\n\nBut the fight needed another selling point, and Nevada State Athletic Commission members were happy to give it one.\n\n\"It's an unusual contest for us as a commission,\" chairman Anthony Marnell said.\n\nUnusual, well, yes. The fight matches an Irish UFC champion in his first professional boxing match against a fighter who was throwing punches before he could walk and who won all 49 of his pro fights before announcing his retirement.\n\nBut commission members -- who regulate both UFC and boxing in Nevada -- are charged with protecting the health and safety of fighters. Their No. 1 job is to make sure as few fighters as possible get their brains scrambled in the ring or in the octagon.\n\nAnd in this case, they failed.\n\nIt was bad enough that the commission approved a novice boxer to go 12 rounds with one of the best fighters of all time, no questions asked. But commission members lost any remaining credibility when they agreed to change the glove size for no real reason other than the two fighters asked for it to help build the hype.\n\nIn doing so, they ignored a letter from the Association of Ringside Physicians asking them not to.\n\n\"We hated to see them break their own rules and regulations kind of arbitrarily,\" said Dr. Larry Lovelace, who heads the association and is also on the Oklahoma State Boxing Commission. \"It seemed almost capricious to change from 10 ounces, which is the prescribed weight of gloves for that weight class.\"\n\nTo be fair, there is no solid medical evidence about the effects of getting hit with smaller gloves. But there was enough anecdotal evidence that the Nevada commission in 2006 adopted regulations that call for 8-ounce gloves in fights 147 pounds or smaller, and 10-ounce gloves for anything above that.\n\nIn the 11 years since, that has been the rule. Until Wednesday, there had been no exceptions.\n\nBut tickets and pay-per-view had to be sold. More people had to be convinced that McGregor actually has a chance in the ring with Mayweather.\n\nAnd convinced they were, at least the ones betting at William Hill. Oddsmakers there lowered the lopsided odds favoring Mayweather from minus-600 to minus-550 because they will be fighting with smaller gloves.\n\nMcGregor himself predicted the smaller gloves would make the night even easier for him.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMost in boxing scoff at that, saying the size of the gloves would matter only if they were both forced to fight in 4-ounce UFC gloves that are open past the knuckle. There's also a school of thought that smaller gloves will actually help Mayweather by making his hands even quicker.\n\nBut by allowing smaller gloves, commission members did more than just try to lure a few more people to Las Vegas next week. They made a decision that, in theory at least, could affect the outcome of the fight.\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

Representatives of both fighters appeared before the Nevada State Athletic Commission to request the waiver.\n\nCommissioners also approved veteran referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring for the fight.\n\nCommission Chairman Anthony Marnell said he was comfortable with the fighters using smaller gloves, but unhappy that they used the issue to sell the fight on social media.\n\n\"I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media battle,\" Marnell said.\n\nUnder Nevada regulations, 10-ounce gloves are required in fights above 147 pounds and the bout is set for 154 pounds. But Mayweather has worn 8-ounce gloves most of his career, and McGregor has worn 4-ounce gloves in his UFC fights.\n\nMayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said his fighter is more comfortable in smaller gloves and would use them to stop McGregor.\n\n\"The fight is going to end in a knockout, I'm very confident,\" Ellerbe said. \"And it will probably be early.\"\n\nMcGregor will be in a boxing ring for the first time as a pro when he takes on Mayweather, who is coming out of retirement for a fight that will make him tens of millions of dollars. They will fight under boxing rules, which will be enforced by Byrd, a veteran of many championship fights.\n\n\"The referee makes a big difference in this fight, which is the specific reason I chose Robert Byrd,\" said Bob Bennett, the commission's executive director.\n\nCommissioners also approved Burt Clements and Dave Moretti of the United States and Italy's Guido Cavalleri as judges for the bout. McGregor's camp had asked for an international judge among the three.\n\nByrd will be paid $25,000 for the bout, while the judges will make $20,000.\n\nThe glove issue took up much of the commission meeting, though in the end all voted in favor of the smaller gloves. There was also discussion about the padding in the gloves, with both sides agreeing to be bound by Nevada boxing inspectors approving the foam padding.\n\nMayweather has fought 46 of his 49 fights with 8-ounce gloves, including his last six. McGregor has never boxed before, but quickly agreed to Mayweather's challenge on social media to fight in smaller gloves.\n\nCommissioners said they struggled with making an exception to regulations in place since 2006, but decided to approve the waiver because of the unusual nature of the event.\n\n\"The fight is not normal,\" said Commissioner Sandra Morgan.\n\nJohn Hornewer, an attorney for Mayweather, said the unbeaten boxer would likely not be at the 154-pound limit at the fight weigh-in anyway.\n\n\"He'll be 150 pounds. That's his best weight and there's no reason to put on extra weight,\" Hornewer said.\n\nA McGregor representative said his fighter has been about 160 pounds in training camp and would likely enter the ring somewhere around that weight after making the 154-pound limit the day before.", "id": "9544464", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Mayweather and McGregor will fight in smaller

The NSAC stipulates that in most cases, fights taking place at 154-pounds or above should use 10-ounce gloves.\n\nHowever, after a verbal challenge from McGregor, Mayweather recently revealed on social media that he was willing to accept eight-ounce equipment.\n\n\"I'm very happy with how (the commission) handled it,\" McGregor said on a conference call with reporters. \"They took both fighters' requests into consideration, and I'm very happy with it. You've got pros and cons on both sides, and both athletes asking for it. I am coming up in weight on the gloves. Look at what I fight with (normally).\"\n\nIt's widely assumed that lighter gloves could benefit the heavy-handed McGregor, as opposed to the more defensively minded and tactical\n\nstyle of Mayweather.\n\nUFC President Dana White agreed.\n\n\"Now we are fighting in eight-ounce gloves, and it is going to be a fight,\" White said. \"Anything can happen in a fight. I think it affects the contest. Yes, Floyd is faster. But he's a defensive master. Conor hits like a truck. Smaller gloves favor him big time. It affects the fight big time.\"\n\nThe NSAC also revealed that Robert Byrd would referee the contest. Kenny Bayless, the official for many of Mayweather's recent bouts, was ruled out after previously voicing his criticism of the clash, which will see the 49-0 Mayweather taking on, in McGregor, a man making his boxing debut.\n\n\"They gave us options, and we didn't necessarily ask for any ref in particular,\" McGregor said. \"There was a ref or two who gave opinions, and if that's the case it makes it hard.\n\n\"Robert Byrd is a phenomenal ref. He lets the fight take place and steps in when he should step in. He has some links to the MMA world as well, so that's good.\"\n\nFor more on \"The Money Fight: Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor,\" check out the MMA Rumors section of the site.", "id": "9597806", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Conor McGregor 'very happy' with NSAC's 8-ounce glove exception for Floyd Mayweather fight", "image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/conor-mcgregor-workout-7.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 120, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 127}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "id": "308238", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kenny Bayless"}, "id": "1084220", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bayless"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 562, "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "21:40:00"}

(Frank Franklin II/AP)\n\nIn a rare move, the Nevada Athletic Commission made an exception to its rules to allow Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor to wear eight-ounce gloves in their much-hyped Aug. 26 bout instead of the standard 10-ounce variety that are typically used at the 154-pound weight class. UFC, where McGregor is under contract, was one of the first to break the news midday on Wednesday.\n\nBREAKING: Gloves set at eight ounces, officials named for #MayweatherMcGregor fight on August 26:https://t.co/2MUXBo4A4P\n\n-- UFC (@ufc) August 16, 2017\n\nThe waiver came after both fighters lobbied for the lighter gloves on social media and made formal requests to the NAC.\n\nDon't believe what you hear in the media. Don't believe what you hear on blog sites. If it's not coming directly from me, then it's not true. I'm telling McGregor, \"Let's fight in 8 oz gloves\". McGregor can fight in any brand he prefers or chooses. I'll be wearing 8 oz Grant gloves. Whatever advantage McGregor needs to feel more comfortable in the ring, I'm willing to accommodate. Let's give the boxing and MMA fans what they want to see. @grantworldwide @mayweatherpromotions\n\nA post shared by Floyd Mayweather (@floydmayweather) on Aug 1, 2017 at 3:39pm PDT\n\nAs news spread of the exception, some fans on social media assumed the lighter gloves, which are closer to the four-ounce variety McGregor uses for mixed martial arts, might benefit the Irishman more than Mayweather, who has boxed with 10- and eight-ounce gloves in the past.\n\nIt's official 8 oz gloves for #MayweatherMcGregor have been approved.\n\nThink this will benefit McGregor more then Mayweather. pic.twitter.com/EBQWyHpQgf\n\n-- PARLAY WOLF (@parlaywolf) August 16, 2017\n\nOthers, however, have said the glove weight will likely make no difference, as standard boxing rules still apply, which should give Mayweather -- with his undefeated 49-0 record -- the edge over McGregor, who has never boxed professionally.\n\nVegas appears somewhere in the middle, tightening the odds slightly, but still keeping Mayweather the huge favorite, according to MMA reporter Simon Head.\n\nThe #MayweatherMcGregor odds are tighter than ever in Vegas (per @justinhartling):\n\nMayweather: -450\n\nMcGregor: +325\n\n-- Simon Head (@simonhead) August 16, 2017\n\nThe lighter gloves certainly provide each fighter more of a chance to win by knockout, as the two-ounce difference allows punches to land quicker and harder. It was because of that reason that the Association of Ringside Physicians asked NAC to use \"caution\" before making the decision to use lighter gloves.\n\n\"Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of the bout, we should strongly caution against allowing current regulations to be overruled,\" ARP board chairman Raymond Monsell wrote in a letter on Tuesday (via MMA Junkie). \"To do so would also set a precedent for future bouts.\"\n\nPerhaps hoping to combat future requests, NAC pointed out Wednesday's decision was a \"one-time\" waiver, according to MMA Fighting.\n\nRead more:\n\nSomeone bet big on Floyd Mayweather as another worrisome Conor McGregor video goes up\n\nWith straight face, Floyd Mayweather says Conor McGregor has the edge in their bout\n\n'This has become a fiasco.

Floyd Mayweather Jr., too, because it likely means more sales for what could be the richest fight ever.\n\nNevada boxing regulators went out of their way to give a gift to both fighters, approving an exemption to the rule requiring 10-ounce gloves for the 154-pound fight so that both fighters can wear 8-ounce gloves.\n\nAnd just like that, the fight appeared more competitive - at least to some.\n\nOddsmaker William Hill immediately boosted the odds of McGregor winning, though they are still low. And UFC chief Dana White didn't wait long to trumpet the smaller gloves as a game changer.\n\n\"It affects the fight big time,\" White said. \"When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don't know what changed but I'm glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.\"\n\nThe underlying school of thought is that McGregor will have a better chance of knocking Mayweather out with smaller gloves, though Mayweather has fought all but three of his professional fights with 8-ounce gloves and has never been knocked out.\n\nBut the fight needed another selling point, and Nevada State Athletic Commission members were happy to give it one.\n\n\"It's an unusual contest for us as a commission,\" said chairman Anthony Marnell.\n\nUnusual, well, yes. The fight matches a UFC champion in his first professional boxing match against a fighter who was throwing punches before he could walk and who won all 49 of his pro fights before announcing his retirement.\n\nCommission members - who regulate both UFC and boxing in Nevada - are charged with protecting the health and safety of fighters. Their No. 1 job is to make sure as few fighters as possible get their brains scrambled in the ring or in the octagon.\n\nAnd in this case, they failed.\n\nIt was bad enough that the commission approved a novice boxer to go 12 arounds with one of the best fighters of all time, no questions asked. But commission members lost any remaining credibility when they agreed to change the glove size for no real reason other than the two fighters asked for it.\n\nIn doing so, they ignored a letter from the Association of Ringside Physicians asking them not to.\n\n\"We hated to see them break their own rules and regulations kind of arbitrarily,\" said Dr. Larry Lovelace, who heads the association and is also on the Oklahoma State Boxing Commission. \"It seemed almost capricious to change from 10 ounces, which is the prescribed weight of gloves for that weight class.\"\n\nTo be fair, there is no solid medical evidence about the effects of getting hit with smaller gloves. But there was enough anecdotal evidence that the Nevada commission in 2006 adopted regulations that call for 8-ounce gloves in fights 147 pounds or smaller, and 10-ounce gloves for anything above that.\n\nIn the 11 years since, that has been the rule. Until Wednesday, there had been no exceptions.\n\nBut tickets and pay-per-view had to be sold. More people had to be convinced that McGregor actually has a chance in the ring with Mayweather.\n\nAnd convinced they were, at least the ones betting at William Hill. Oddsmakers there lowered the lopsided odds favoring Mayweather from minus-600 to minus-550 because they will be fighting with smaller gloves.\n\nMcGregor himself predicted the smaller gloves would make the night even easier for him.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMost in boxing scoff at that, saying the size of the gloves would only matter if they were both forced to fight in 4-ounce UFC gloves that are open past the knuckle.

McGregor and Mayweather agreed to a 154-pound bout.\n\nMayweather has used 8-ounce gloves in all but three of his 49 career fights, but McGregor doesn't care.

Many observers felt the NSAC's decision was influenced by the hundreds of millions that are involved in the event.\n\nAccording to Nevada Commission head Bob Bennett, this decision to approve 8-ounce gloves was a for the benefit of the fighters and the fans.\n\n\"Conor is used to fighting in 4-ounce gloves. Floyd typically fights in 8-ounce gloves with three exceptions - 'Canelo', Miguel Cotto and Oscar De La Hoya - because he usually fights at welterweight [147lbs],\" Bennett told Sky Sports.\n\n\"We evaluated our regulations and decided it was in the best interest of the fighters and the fans to deviate for one-time only. This is a one-time waiver with the caveat that the gloves must be inspected, which is standard procedure. The original pair must then be returned to the commission after the fight for our inspection.\"\n\nAsked about safety concerns with the smaller gloves, Bennett said: \"We initiated a study to see if there is a significant difference between 8oz and 10oz gloves.

Odds opened +700, now +425. #MayweatherMcGregor pic.twitter.com/81skYULebz\n\n&mdash; Sports Insights (@SportsInsights) August 17, 2017\n\nBecause McGregor is somewhat of a long shot, the average bet placed on the UFC star is smaller than the average bet for Mayweather. Still, 76 percent of the total money wagered has gone towards a McGregor victory.\n\nWhen the fight became official on June 14, William Hill named McGregor a +700 underdog and Mayweather was given -1100 betting odds. McGregor's odds have since dropped to +425, and Mayweather is now a -550 favorite at the sportsbook.\n\nOnline sportsbooks are offering even better odds for McGregor. He's down to a +325 underdog, via OddsShark, and Mayweather has -450 odds on some betting websites.\n\nEven as he faces the greatest boxer of his generation, McGregor continues to promise a victory over Mayweather in his first professional boxing match. After initially predicting a knockout within four rounds, the UFC star now says Mayweather won't make it past the second round because the fighters will be wearing eight-ounce gloves instead of 10-ounce gloves.\n\nMayweather hasn't been nearly as braggadocious in the build towards the fight. He continued to assure fans that he had the advantage over his opponent when he spoke on stage during the four-stop press tour in July, but he's continued to assert that McGregor has a chance to win.\n\nThe betting odds continue to move in Conor McGregor's favor as the public picks him to beat Floyd Mayweather. Pictured: McGregor during the World Press Tour at SSE Arena on July 14, 2017 in London, England. Photo: Getty Images\n\nBecause of his age and size, Mayweather has contended that McGregor actually has the edge, at least on paper. McGregor is 11 years younger with a longer reach, and he's more accustomed to fighting at the 154-pound weight limit.\n\nThe public hasn't seen Mayweather dominate in the ring in quite some time. His last fight was two years ago when he beat Andre Berto by unanimous decision, and it's been a decade since he knocked out an opponent with punches that weren't deemed controversial.\n\nMcGregor has won three fights since Mayweather last stepped in the ring, including knockouts over the 145-pound and 155-pound UFC champions. Last weekend, fans saw footage of McGregor getting the better of former world boxing champion Paulie Malignaggi during one of their sparring sessions.\n\nMcGregor is the best trash talker in the UFC. His gift of gab is as much of a reason for his rise to stardom as his success inside the octagon.\n\nMayweather is a master promoter, as well, and the two fighters seem to have convinced a large portion of the public that the bout will be closer than many boxing experts would have them believe.", "id": "9725923", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Almost Everyone Is Betting On

Floyd Mayweather Jr., too, because it likely means more sales for what could be the richest fight ever.\n\nNevada boxing regulators went out of their way to give a gift to both fighters, approving an exemption to the rule requiring 10-ounce gloves for the 154-pound fight so that both fighters can wear 8-ounce gloves.\n\nAnd just like that, the fight appeared more competitive -- at least to some.\n\nOddsmaker William Hill immediately boosted the odds of McGregor winning, though they are still low. And UFC chief Dana White didn't wait long to trumpet the smaller gloves as a game changer.\n\n\"It affects the fight big time,\" White said. \"When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don't know what changed, but I'm glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.\"\n\nThe underlying school of thought is that McGregor will have a better chance of knocking Mayweather out with smaller gloves, though Mayweather has fought all but three of his professional fights with 8-ounce gloves and has never been knocked out in any of them.\n\nBut the fight needed another selling point, and Nevada State Athletic Commission members were happy to give it one.\n\n\"It's an unusual contest for us as a commission,\" chairman Anthony Marnell said.\n\nUnusual, well, yes. The fight matches an Irish UFC champion in his first professional boxing match against a fighter who was throwing punches before he could walk and who won all 49 of his pro fights before announcing his retirement.\n\nBut commission members -- who regulate both UFC and boxing in Nevada -- are charged with protecting the health and safety of fighters. Their No. 1 job is to make sure as few fighters as possible get their brains scrambled in the ring or in the octagon.\n\nAnd in this case, they failed.\n\nIt was bad enough that the commission approved a novice boxer to go 12 rounds with one of the best fighters of all time, no questions asked. But commission members lost any remaining credibility when they agreed to change the glove size for no real reason other than the two fighters asked for it to help build the hype.\n\nIn doing so, they ignored a letter from the Association of Ringside Physicians asking them not to.\n\n\"We hated to see them break their own rules and regulations kind of arbitrarily,\" said Dr. Larry Lovelace, who heads the association and is also on the Oklahoma State Boxing Commission. \"It seemed almost capricious to change from 10 ounces, which is the prescribed weight of gloves for that weight class.\"\n\nTo be fair, there is no solid medical evidence about the effects of getting hit with smaller gloves. But there was enough anecdotal evidence that the Nevada commission in 2006 adopted regulations that call for 8-ounce gloves in fights 147 pounds or smaller, and 10-ounce gloves for anything above that.\n\nIn the 11 years since, that has been the rule. Until Wednesday, there had been no exceptions.\n\nBut tickets and pay-per-view had to be sold. More people had to be convinced that McGregor actually has a chance in the ring with Mayweather.\n\nAnd convinced they were, at least the ones betting at William Hill. Oddsmakers there lowered the lopsided odds favoring Mayweather from minus-600 to minus-550 because they will be fighting with smaller gloves.\n\nMcGregor himself predicted the smaller gloves would make the night even easier for him.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMost in boxing scoff at that, saying the size of the gloves would matter only if they were both forced to fight in 4-ounce UFC gloves that are open past the knuckle. There's also a school of thought that smaller gloves will actually help Mayweather by making his hands even quicker.\n\nBut by allowing smaller gloves, commission members did more than just try to lure a few more people to Las Vegas next week. They made a decision that, in theory at least, could affect the outcome of the fight.\n\nAnd by any standard, that's a bad decision to make.\n\n___\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

A more detailed analysis of the sparring footage can be found here.\n\nRead more Mayweather and McGregor should not be allowed to fight in 8oz gloves\n\nHowever, Mayweather has said he was not impressed by the footage and has instead said all it proves is that McGregor is \"extremely dirty\" in the ring.\n\n\"A lot of shots were illegal,\" said Mayweather of the footage. \"There was a lot of grappling and illegal punching behind the head.\"\n\nHe added: \"He had Joe Cortez (a retired Hall of Fame referee) in his camp but I still saw him being extremely dirty. My job is not to worry about the referee but to let the referee do his job.\"\n\nMayweather added the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\nMayweather vs McGregor: From trash-talk to super-fight 18 show all Mayweather vs McGregor: From trash-talk to super-fight 1/18 From trash-talk to super-fight\n\nJust how did an appearance on late-night show Conan and a rumbling Twitter feud turn into the biggest fight the sport of boxing has ever known.\n\nHere, we tell the story of how the trash-talk turned into a super-fight.\n\nGetty Images\n\n2/18 McGregor appears on Conan\n\n\"If you're asking would I like to fight Floyd Mayweather, I mean, who would not like to dance around the ring for $180m?\" McGregor replied to a playful question from late-night host Conan O'Brien, in July 2015, on whether he would ever be tempted into switching sports.\n\n\"I would certainly box him if the opportunity arose,\" he smiled.\n\n\"Most certainly.\"\n\n3/18 Mayweather's observation\n\nMayweather then rekindled the speculation, that December. In an interview with FightHype on the worldwide adulation McGregor had received for knocking out Aldo in just 13 seconds, the American complained that he would never receive such acclaim from the public because of the colour of his skin.\n\n\"They say he talk a lot of trash and people praise him for it, but when I did it, they say I'm cocky and arrogant,\" Mayweather observed.\n\n\"So biased! Like I said before, all I'm saying is this, I ain't racist at all, but I'm telling you racism still exists.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\n4/18 \"I am an Irishman\"\n\nThis time, it didn't take the other man the best part of half a year to respond. \"Don't ever bring my race into my success again,\" McGregor commented in a long Instagram post, the very next day.\n\n\"I am an Irishman. My people have been oppressed our entire existence. And still very much are. I understand the feeling of prejudice. It is a feeling that is deep in my blood ... If you want we can organise a fight no problem. I will give you a fair 80/20 split purse in my favour seen as your last fight bombed at every area of revenue.\"\n\nA feud was born.\n\n5/18 McGregor 'retires'\n\nAs interest in a fight with Mayweather began to increase, McGregor threatened to retire not just from MMA, but from sport altogether.\n\nUFC president Dana White announced that the promotion has pulled McGregor from the main event at UFC 200, because of his refusal to participate in mandatory media duties. McGregor's response?\n\n\"I have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya's later.\"\n\n6/18 Scoop\n\nThings came to a boil in May 2016. British tabloid The Sun reported that the two men were \"on the verge\" of agreeing to a deal, with an unnamed source telling the paper that \"Floyd is obsessed with making Conor eat his words\".\n\nThe story attracted so much attention that Dana White, the president of the UFC, felt compelled to finally address the situation. He laughed off suggestions the super-fight would ever take place, instead pointing out that McGregor was contracted to the UFC, and would thus be in breach of contract should he attempt to organise a fight himself away from the confines of the Octagon.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\n7/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters\n\nWhite's comments appeared to spur both men into action. First McGregor tweeted a mocked up fight poster with the caption 'MMA vs Boxing'...\n\nGetty Images\n\n8/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters\n\n... before Mayweather responded with an effort of his own (it wasn't quite as good).\n\nMayweather insisted began to insist a fight was \"possible\". Then he told a journalist that he was a retired man and would only countenance returning to professional sport in order to fight McGregor. And then he pressed the nuclear button, offering the Irishman just $50m to fight him in what people were already describing as a billion-dollar bout.\n\nGetty Images\n\n9/18 Leonard Ellerbe puts his foot down\n\nHold the hype. Just as things were beginning to heat up, Mayweather's promotions head, Leonard Ellerbe, poured cold water on the prospective fight, insisting it was \"a calculated effort by McGregor to gain more fans\".\n\nGetty Images\n\n10/18 Mac gets personal\n\nIn an attempt to get discussions back on track, McGregor got personal.\n\n\"Call me CJ Watson!\" he tweet, with a cartoon of him standing triumphantly above a knocked out Mayweather.\n\nThe caption was explosive: Mayweather was sent to prison in 2010 for the assault of his then-girlfriend. He was reportedly angry about text messages she had received from NBA star CJ Watson.\n\nGetty Images\n\n11/18 White rebuffed\n\nAt this point in the saga the president of the UFC, Dana White, reenters the fray.\n\nHaving previously insisted that the fight was a non-starter, he suddenly proposed a deal: $25m for each fighter, with the complicated PPV splits to be patiently worked out at a later date.\n\n\"He's a f***ing comedian,\" Mayweather replied.\n\nGetty Images\n\n12/18 In February 2017...\n\n... McGregor arrived in Las Vegas, to much excitement.\n\nMayweather tweeted the following.\n\nGetty Images\n\n13/18 Conor's response\n\nMcGregor's response to Mayweather's short statement was brutal and to the point.\n\n\"I am in Las Vegas. Floyd has retired on my arrival,\" he observed.\n\n14/18 Conan's back!\n\nWithout Conan O'Brien the biggest fight in the history of boxing would still be a daydream.\n\nIn March he invited Dana White onto his show, who said the following.\n\n\"I do think it's gonna happen. I think it's going to be a tough deal because obviously [there are] a lot of egos involved in this deal and a lot of people, so that always makes it tougher.\n\n\"On the flip side, there's so much money involved. I just don't see how it doesn't happen.\"\n\n15/18 Conor and Conlan\n\nMcGrgor was in New York to support Belfast boxer Michael Conlan in his professional debut against Tim Ibarra in March.\n\nBut the spotlight quickly sought him out. He reminded everyone that an announcement was imminent by shouting furiously into the face of ESPN boxing reporter Dan Rafael: \"I AM BOXING!\"\n\nGetty Images\n\n16/18 Fine downgraded\n\nOn March 22, an outstanding fine McGregor had with the Nevada Athletic Commission was downgraded, paving the way for the Irishman to obtain his necessary boxing license.\n\nGetty Images\n\n17/18 McGregor confirms\n\nOn Wednesday 14 June, the fight was finally confirmed by both men.\n\n\"THE FIGHT IS ON,\" McGregor posted on Twitter, along with a mocking picture of himself side-by-side with Floyd Mayweather Snr.\n\n18/18 Mayweather confirms\n\n\"It's official!\" replied Mayweather on Instagram, along with a short promotional video confirming the involvement of Showtime.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMore about: UFC Floyd Mayweather Conor McGregor Mayweather vs McGregor Paulie Malignaggi Reuse content", "id": "9886384", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Mayweather attacks McGregor for being a 'dirty fighter'", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/18/12/f-mayweather.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 7455, "date": "-06-14", "amb": false, "textEnd": 7462}, {"textStart": 7235, "date": "-03-22", "amb": false, "textEnd": 7243}, {"textStart": 1953, "date": "2015-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1962}, {"textStart": 3757, "date": "2016-05-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3765}, {"textStart": 6101, "date": "2017-02-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 6114}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "91866", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}, "id": "302665", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}, "id": "304131", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association"}, {"label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}, "id": "305090", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "id": "305867", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "307741", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Valley"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trash-talk"}, "id": "325883", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash-talk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grappling"}, "id": "325886", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conan O'Brien"}, "id": "478726", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_O'Brien"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Cortez"}, "id": "498372", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cortez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "C.

Floyd Mayweather Jr., too, because it likely means more sales for what could be the richest fight ever.\n\nNevada boxing regulators went out of their way to give a gift to both fighters, approving an exemption to the rule requiring 10-ounce gloves for the 154-pound fight so that both fighters can wear 8-ounce gloves.\n\nAnd just like that, the fight appeared more competitive -- at least to some.\n\nOddsmaker William Hill immediately boosted the odds of McGregor winning, though they are still low. And UFC chief Dana White didn't wait long to trumpet the smaller gloves as a game changer.\n\n\"It affects the fight big time,\" White said. \"When we were in our original negotiations it was something they would not even talk about. I don't know what changed but I'm glad it did. It makes it so much more fun.\"\n\nThe underlying school of thought is that McGregor will have a better chance of knocking Mayweather out with smaller gloves, though Mayweather has fought all but three of his professional fights with 8-ounce gloves and has never been knocked out.\n\nBut the fight needed another selling point, and Nevada State Athletic Commission members were happy to give it one.\n\n\"It's an unusual contest for us as a commission,\" said chairman Anthony Marnell.\n\nUnusual, well, yes. The fight matches a UFC champion in his first professional boxing match against a fighter who was throwing punches before he could walk and who won all 49 of his pro fights before announcing his retirement.\n\nCommission members -- who regulate both UFC and boxing in Nevada -- are charged with protecting the health and safety of fighters. Their No. 1 job is to make sure as few fighters as possible get their brains scrambled in the ring or in the octagon.\n\nAnd in this case, they failed.\n\nIt was bad enough that the commission approved a novice boxer to go 12 arounds with one of the best fighters of all time, no questions asked. But commission members lost any remaining credibility when they agreed to change the glove size for no real reason other than the two fighters asked for it.\n\nIn doing so, they ignored a letter from the Association of Ringside Physicians asking them not to.\n\n\"We hated to see them break their own rules and regulations kind of arbitrarily,\" said Dr. Larry Lovelace, who heads the association and is also on the Oklahoma State Boxing Commission. \"It seemed almost capricious to change from 10 ounces, which is the prescribed weight of gloves for that weight class.\"\n\nTo be fair, there is no solid medical evidence about the effects of getting hit with smaller gloves. But there was enough anecdotal evidence that the Nevada commission in 2006 adopted regulations that call for 8-ounce gloves in fights 147 pounds or smaller, and 10-ounce gloves for anything above that.\n\nIn the 11 years since, that has been the rule. Until Wednesday, there had been no exceptions.\n\nBut tickets and pay-per-view had to be sold. More people had to be convinced that McGregor actually has a chance in the ring with Mayweather.\n\nAnd convinced they were, at least the ones betting at William Hill. Oddsmakers there lowered the lopsided odds favoring Mayweather from minus-600 to minus-550 because they will be fighting with smaller gloves.\n\nMcGregor himself predicted the smaller gloves would make the night even easier for him.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMost in boxing scoff at that, saying the size of the gloves would only matter if they were both forced to fight in 4-ounce UFC gloves that are open past the knuckle. There's also a school of thought that smaller gloves will actually help Mayweather by making his hands even quicker.\n\nBut by allowing smaller gloves, commission members did more than just try and lure a few more people to Las Vegas next week. They made a decision that, in theory at least, could affect the outcome of the fight.\n\nAnd by any standard, that's a bad decision to make.\n\n____\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

Mayweather won this contest and extended his undefeated record at that time to 48-0. Now here we stand just nine days away from one of the most talked about events of the summer: Mayweather vs. McGregor.\n\nNow, this has been the fight that everyone is talking about. Floyd Mayweather has never backed down from a fight and Connor McGregor is fairly confident that the transition from the UFC to Boxing will be no issue. Here are the ten numbers you need to know before next Saturday's fight.\n\n3: Can Floyd Mayweather make it a perfect 50-0? Connor McGregor has three losses in his MMA career, all to submission. The fact that McGregor has never lost to a KO or TKO could benefit him in the boxing ring to take the match the full 12 rounds.\n\n44: The two fighters coming into this bout have had 44 combined knockouts (18 for McGregor and 26 for Mayweather). Floyd Mayweather has not knocked out an opponent since Victor Ortiz in 2011 and Connor McGregor's last fight ended with him knocking out Eddie Alvarez.\n\n11: Floyd Mayweather is the seasoned veteran in this fight, coming in at 11 years older than McGregor. McGregor being over a decade younger could play an impact if the fight goes into the later rounds and Mayweather might not be able to dodge the haymakers that McGregor will attempt to throw.\n\n60,000,000: Ticket sales have already eclipsed 60 million dollars with the average tickets going for just under 3,700 dollars right now. Ringside seats are quoted at approximately 10,000 dollars but have seen going as high as approximately 170,000 dollars a ticket.\n\n89.95: Just in case you can't afford the almost 4,000 dollar ticket, there is good news! The price of the fight is 89.95 (99.95 for HD). There also a multitude of bars and restaurants that will be charging cover to watch the fight just in case you want to pay even less for what many regard as the fight of the century.\n\n4: Connor McGregor has been very vocal about how he believes that he will beat Floyd Mayweather inside four rounds. Many believe that McGregor will get his shot to land a haymaker on Floyd. But, the question is how many opportunities will McGregor get with Mayweather's great agility?\n\n8: The NSAC has approved a special exception for McGregor and Mayweather to wear eight ounce gloves instead of the traditional ten ounce gloves that are worn for fights above 147 pounds. McGregor's gloves for MMA are weighing in at four ounces, so it will be intriguing to see if this weight change has any impact on him.\n\nOne Billion: With the predicted numbers coming into this fight for the purse, Floyd Mayweather will become the third ever athlete to gain 1 billion dollars from career earnings. The other two? Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, this is an elite group of athletes to join.\n\n36 Minutes: Floyd Mayweather has already come out and said that he is more than happy to fight for 36 minutes in order to earn a 300 million dollar paycheck. Will McGregor have the stamina to last all 12 rounds if this fight goes the distance?\n\n2: Connor McGregor does indeed have a two inch reach advantage at 74 inches over Mayweather's 72. This might play a factor in having McGregor land that one big punch that some are hoping he is able to land on Floyd and knock him out.\n\nThe fight can be seen on Showtime on August 26th at nine pm. It'll be viewed by millions of people across the world and all the debates will finally be squashed when these two extraordinary athletes take the ring in just nine days to see who will come out as victor.", "id": "9830326", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "10 things you need to know before watching the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight | isportsweb", "image": "http://www.isportsweb.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/08/USATSI_10159240.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 3401, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3412}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}, "id": "305028", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "id": "308238", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}, "id": "312575", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Victor Ortiz"}, "id": "390609", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Ortiz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}, "id": "418449", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 403, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain Names", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain_Names"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1049, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "23:14:00"}

We're going to find out pretty early who is telling the truth. So we'll see who takes a back step first. I am exciting for the contest and I will go forward and put him away.\"\n\nMcGregor (21-3 MMA), also the former featherweight champion, was last seen knocking out then-champion Eddie Alvarez at UFC 2015 in Nov. 2015, earning his 155-pound title in the process. This win made the Irishman the first fighter in UFC history to hold belts in two different weight classes simultaneously.\n\nBut against Mayweather, McGregor will have the distinct honor of making his professional boxing debut against a man many consider the best of his generation.\n\n\"I'm going down in the history books, Conan,\" said McGregor. \" I will have dominated the UFC and I will dominate boxing also. It has never been done. So I am going down in the history books.\"\n\nMayweather (49-0 boxing), a former five-division world champion, has not competed since his decision win over Andre Berto is Sept. 2015. Prior to this win, he defeated Manny Pacquiao in their highly promoted bout in May 2015.\n\nMayweather and McGregor will finally lock horns on Aug. 26 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

There's a lot of speculation about whether McGregor will elect to use his MMA skills to knockout or incapacitate Mayweather Jr. in their fight.\n\nSome boxing and MMA fans think McGregor could gain a lot of respect if he were to lose the fight by a disqualification by using one of his UFC fighting techniques to hurt Mayweather. Floyd Sr. says he will not stand for that. He'll launch a lawsuit on his son's behalf against McGregor.\n\nMayweather said this week that McGregor will lose 90 percent of his contract if he chooses to foul him. He says it's in the contract. Mayweather seemed pretty confident in discussing it that McGregor won't dare foul him.\n\n\"He's training good enough for a guy like this,\" Mayweather Sr. told The Herd about Floyd Jr's training for the McGregor fight. \"When he goes in there with Floyd, that's when he gets all the daylights whopped out of him. Even if he was fighting a 4 rounder, he ain't going to win. Floyd's fought many left-handers, no problem,\" said Floyd Sr.\n\nFloyd Sr. says Mayweather training just hard enough for him to beat McGregor. He wouldn't say whether he's training harder than usual. He thinks he's doing more than enough to beat a fighter of McGregor's level.\n\n\"That's going to stop right there,\" said Floyd Sr. about the possibility of McGregor fouling Mayweather with rabbit punches and other different fouls. \"Then we're going to throw a big suit at him. Of course well would. That's now how we planned it. He came to box. That's what he thought he could do. No, Mayweather didn't discuss it. That's me,\" said Floyd Sr. in talking about him potentially suing McGregor if he fouls Mayweather. \"This is something you can be sued.\"\n\nThe fine that McGregor would take for fouling Mayweather will likely be enough of a deterrent to keep him honest in the fight. McGregor isn't the type to want to throw away money. I think he'll fight a clean fight. Besides, there's a chance the two of them will face each other in a rematch in the octagon. Why would McGregor want to jeopardize a big money rematch by fouling Mayweather? It's unlikely that McGregor will want to risk losing out on the rematch by hurting Mayweather by fouling him needlessly.\n\nMcGregor appears to truly believe that he can win this fight. He looked good in his sparring clips with Paulie Malignaggi. If McGregor is as good as the sparring video showed, he doesn't' need to foul Mayweather to try and gain an edge.\n\n\"Conor don't have what it takes. Floyd is much faster than Conor. I'm faster than Conor right now today,\" said Floyd Sr. \"That was a joke. Neither one of them can fight,\" said Floyd Sr. about the sparring between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. \"He ain't nothing.

However, the former has worn four-ounce gloves throughout his Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) career, while the latter has worn eight-ounce gloves in 46 of his 49 fights.\n\nThe Irishman, widely considered the heavy underdog ahead of what will be his first ever professional boxing match, believes Nevada boxing regulator's decision to allow eight-ounce gloves will benefit him.\n\nThe lighter gloves have less padding over the knuckles and are generally thought to favour the heavier puncher.\n\n\"I don't believe with the new gloves he makes it out of the second round,\" the UFC champion told reporters on a conference call.\n\n\"I don't want people saying 'Oh, it was a lucky punch' and all that. Part of me is hoping maybe he can last so I can show some skill and dismantle him that way.\n\n\"But I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first few rounds.\"\n\nHowever, while the Irishman believes the fight will be over within two rounds, he stressed he was prepared to go the distance to secure what would be a very unlikely win against the five-division world champion.\n\nUFC President Dana White also believes the switch to lighter gloves will benefit McGregor, although he conceded lighter gloves could also help Mayweather's notoriously fast hands.\n\n\"I think it affects the contest a lot,\" White said. \"Yes, Floyd will be faster with eight-ounce gloves but he's more defensive. Conor hits like a truck, so smaller gloves helps him big time. I think it absolutely does.\"\n\nMcGregor and Mayweather have traded insults in the lead-up to next week's fight and the 29-year-old said he felt disrespected by the boxing community, but vowed to use that as a motivation in 10-days time.\n\n\"It's certainly motivating. The disrespect of my skill-set,\" he said. \"I look at people and their minds are closed. 'It's a set way and there's no other way'.

The Nevada Athletic Commission made a number of important decisions regarding the fight including who would ref and judge, and also agreed to allow the fighters to wear 8 ounce gloves instead of 10 ounce.\n\nThat was a request made by Floyd Mayweather over social media, and after Team McGregor agreed the two parties approached the NAC for a decision. Despite a letter from the Association of Ringside Physicians asking the commission to deny the change, an agreement was reached allowing it due to the unusual nature of the boxer vs MMA fighter bout.\n\n\"I'm very happy with how the Nevada State Athletic Commission handled it, actually,\" McGregor said during a media call later in the day. \"They handled it fairly, they listened to both requests and just the overall approach to the decision in the referee and the judges, I think they were very fair throughout, so that was a good thing for me to see that. Taking into consideration both fighter's requests and I'm very happy with it.\"\n\nThe smaller gloves aren't just an advantage for McGregor. They're also the size of gloves Mayweather is used to fighting in.\n\n\"You've got pros and cons on both sides,\" Conor admitted. \"You've got both athletes asking for the request, and you've got me also coming up 8 ounces from what I'm used to ... Hey, look what I fight with with. I fight in 4 ounce gloves. Fingerless gloves. The knuckles are barely covered in what I'm used to. It benefits both in certain ways, so I'm very happy with it.\"\n\n\"I was already up 6 ounces from 4 to 10, so it's down a little bit from 10 to 8. How often he's worn the gloves or any of that doesn't really factor into - I didn't even know that, for instance. So that didn't factor into my thoughts at all. I do not care about his record, I do not care about his achievements, every fight is on a fight by fight basis so that's how we approach it.\"\n\nAnd while McGregor doesn't care what Mayweather can do with 8 ounce gloves, he did say he felt more confident in a quick knockout finish now that the smaller gloves were in play.\n\n\"I believe now with the gloves at 8 ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"Part of me is hoping maybe he can last so the word of 'Oh, a lucky puncher' - which I've been labeled with before, even though I have multiple under one minute KOs on my record. So part of me wants to show some skill and dismantle him that way. But I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\n\"But we are ready for absolutely any scenario.

Mayweather and McGregor will square off at 154 pounds, where 10-ounce gloves are normally the standard in Nevada. However, during Tuesday's meeting, NAC members agreed to allow a one-time exception for eight-ounce gloves given the unusual circumstances of the fight.\n\nEight-ounce gloves are usually utilized at bouts 135 pounds and below in Nevada, while bouts contested between 135 and 147 pounds can use either eight- or 10-ounce gloves depending on fighter preference. On Tuesday, the Association of Ringside Physicians cautioned \"strongly against allowing current regulations to be overruled.\"\n\nHowever, the eight-ounce gloves and their alternates must be inspected and approved by NAC chairman Anthony Marnell and executive director Bob Bennett prior to their use. Additionally, the gloves must be submitted to the NAC after the bout to be used for a study on glove size.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives for both Mayweather and McGregor said there were no safety concerns for either fighter accompanying the change in glove size. The Nevada commissioners were also in agreement that referee Robert Byrd would ultimately be in charge of preserving the athletes' safety come fight night.\n\nThe issue of glove size became a hot topic when Mayweather and McGregor traded barbs regarding the subject via social media. It was then that both combatants informally agreed to use eight-ounce gloves in the fight. While the NAC generally had no issue with the change, Marnell wasn't pleased with how things played out on social media.\n\n\"I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media bout. Between these two, that part of this request pisses me off,\" he said. \"This body is not the subject of two fighters ... to create social media stir and other controversy to sell tickets and to sell DirecTV.\"", "id": "9597538", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Nevada Commission Grants One-Time Exception for 8-Ounce Gloves in Mayweather-McGregor Bout", "image": "http://www1.cdn.sherdog.com/_images/headers/20170816114248_20170811095444_IMG_8668.JPG", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 260, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 267}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}, "id": "303670", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing glove"}, "id": "419805", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1071, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Social Work", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Social_Work"}], "time": "17:22:00"}

Power is the only way that \"Mystic Mac\" can win this fight, and with a small victory in determining the size of his gloves, the Irishman can arguably see more than a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nHowever, after a verbal challenge from McGregor, Mayweather recently revealed on social media that he was willing to accept eight-ounce equipment.\n\n\"I was already up 6 ounces from 4 to 10, so it's down a little bit from 10 to 8\", he said later. But he's a defensive master. Connor hits like a truck.\n\nMcGregor, meanwhile, said he has used disparagement by the boxing community as motivation. You've got to have an open mind and realise that there are other ways. \"Both athletes were asking for it, and me, I'm coming up in ounces from what I am used to\".\n\n\"But it is what it is, everyone knows I am the multiple-weight world champion of the UFC's featherweight division and lightweight division, and I look forward to going back and continuing where I left off\".\n\nNow that the Mayweather vs McGregor glove weight has been established, both sides will likely think they will have a better chance of scoring the stoppage.\n\nMixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor is happy about the switch to lighter gloves for his August 26 fight against undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather and says his opponent will now struggle to make it past the second round.\n\n\"Overall their approach to the decision [about the gloves], the judges and referee - they were fair throughout in taking into consideration both fighters' requests\", McGregor said.\n\nThe NSAC approved a one time exemption that allows 8 oz gloves in the fight instead of the previously approved 10 oz. \"I do not care about his record, I do not care about his achievements\".\n\nDespite the change, Mayweather will still enter the fight as a heavy favorite.\n\nIt would be one of the wildest outcomes to the fight that would surely break the Internet and be a moment never to be forgotten in the history of sports.", "id": "9740133", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "NAC Approves Use Of Lighter Gloves By Conor McGregor, Floyd Mayweather", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1733, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1742}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "id": "308238", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete"}, {"label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "id": "310320", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}, "id": "311156", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}, "id": "347122", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "06:24:00"}

It's cool,\" he replied.\n\nForbes estimates Mayweather's career earnings to be $700 million (\u00a3544 million) so a monster pay-day against McGregor would take that figure way past the $1 billion (\u00a3777 million) barrier.\n\nMayweather is so confident he will demolish McGregor that he is already promoting his afterparty. \"It will be at my strip club at Girl Collection.

Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nA notorious spender, Mayweather is renowned for his love of fast cars and private jets.

Ahead of the Aug. 26 bout at Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena, where Mayweather will fight for the 50th time professionally and McGregor for the first, Footwear News spoke with boxing and mixed martial arts experts to get their predictions. Here's what some of the best fighters had to say.\n\n\"I think we all know who is going to win, and that's Floyd Mayweather, with an outstanding performance. Mayweather will win because he has 49 professional fights versus someone with no professional fights, coming in from MMA. I believe Mayweather is going to capitalize on McGregor's mistakes. There's no way McGregor is going to win. [This match] is good for both sports, and McGregor is gaining from the situation. He's making the biggest payday he's ever made, and it's not in an MMA cage. On Floyd's end, I believe he's gaining from it also because it's one of the biggest events. They're making more than seven or eight figures.\"\n\n\"I think you favor Floyd Mayweather. At first glance, it's pretty hard to look at that fight and think of anything but a Mayweather victory. But then you think of McGregor: He's a big puncher, he's a bigger guy, and Mayweather is 40 years old and hasn't fought in two years. All of a sudden, you start thinking this isn't so black and white after all. If [McGregor] wins, it's a huge upset. Look at the intangible things: McGregor is not a hopeless guy just jumping in there. McGregor is in his prime and a natural, bona fide athlete who can hit very hard, and I'm sure he'll have a game plan in place for Floyd.\"\n\nMikey Garcia, boxer, Oxnard, Calif.\n\n\"Mayweather wins this easily. Conor is a great MMA fighter but not a professional boxer. Although he uses boxing in MMA, it's nowhere near the caliber and level of Floyd Mayweather. [McGregor could pull off the upset if] he lands one good overhand left or a right hook. One of those punches could turn the fight around or put Floyd down. One-punch power like he carries could definitely do that for him, but I wouldn't be betting on a lucky shot like that. I think it's a good way to merge two sports and create this big entertainment show, and it might create new fans crossing over from one sport to the next.\"\n\nJoe Schilling, Muay Thai kickboxer and mixed martial artist, Los Angeles\n\n\"Mayweather humiliates McGregor in under six rounds, and Conor gasses out in four rounds. It's going to be a completely different level of boxing. The buildup heading into the fight is entertaining, but the reality of McGregor's level of boxing versus Mayweather's -- it'll be embarrassing. It will look really bad. I don't think he'll last. But it brings a lot of money and attention and eyes to combat sports, so it's good on that front. Ultimately, it will bring a lot of new fans; people asking about McGregor don't know anything about boxing or MMA, so it's good for the sport.\"\n\nHeather Hardy, boxer and mixed martial artist, Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\n\"Mayweather will win that fight. Boxing is a science. It's not really a sport that gets won by the stronger guy or the tougher guy; it usually gets won by the guy with more experience. I'm not saying Mayweather is a better fighter than Conor -- [because] if they had a fight on the street where there were no rules or a fight in the cage, Conor would kill him. But Conor is inviting himself into an area where Mayweather has proven to the world 49 times over, against some of the best fighters ever, that he knows more things than anyone else inside the boxing ring.\"\n\nSaad Awad, mixed martial artist, San Bernardino, Calif.\n\n\"McGregor does have a puncher's chance, but I think he has to connect, and Mayweather is known for not getting hit. He might run around for 12 rounds, and if that's what he has to do to win, then that's probably what he's going to do. I think it's bringing awareness to both sports.\"", "id": "9527868", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Mayweather-McGregor: Six Fight Predictions From Boxers and MMA Stars", "image": "https://pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ufc-las-vegas-mayweather-mcgregor-mario-wagner.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 192, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 199}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "227084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "228323", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}, "id": "315153", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kickboxing"}, "id": "330771", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Schilling"}, "id": "830876", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Schilling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mikey Garcia (boxer)"}, "id": "1302479", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikey_Garcia_(boxer)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 529, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 530, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 563, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "17:02:00"}

That's the only reason why he might get to the second round.\"\n\nEllerbe believes a stoppage now may be in the cards.\n\n\"I think with the mindset that both guys have, they're looking to knock each other out...\" he said. \"I think the probability increases if both guys are wearing eight-ounce gloves that somebody is getting knocked out.\"", "id": "9549994", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Floyd Mayweather, Conor McGregor to Use 8-Ounce Gloves for Fight", "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/689/571/hi-res-d33ac4bbff287cb4c1b637a331396875_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 158, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 165}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "id": "302718", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}, "id": "314692", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}, "id": "327676", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "MMAjunkie.com"}, "id": "549013", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMAjunkie.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mayweather Promotions"}, "id": "1301253", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayweather_Promotions"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "15:59:00"}

If this turns out to be the case, it would be the first knockout for Mayweather in 6 years since he stopped Victor Ortiz in 2011. That wasn't much of a knockout. Mayweather hit Ortiz while his hands were down a split second after he had hugged him to tell him that he was sorry for head-butting him.\n\n\"He [McGregor] is going to land shots because in this fight I'm going straight ahead,\" said Floyd. \"Normally it's more taking my time, being very cautious, but this time I'm going straight ahead because the fans deserve it. It's going to be bigger than the Pacquiao fight,\" Mayweather said. \"I feel like I owe the fans seeing as me and Pacquiao didn't give the fans a blockbuster. Me and McGregor should give the fans a blockbuster.\"\n\nPacquiao doesn't give McGregor any chance of beating Mayweather. He doesn't think the UFC fighter will be able to land anything in the fight. If that's the case, there are going to be a lot of hopping mad boxing and MMA fans on August 26. All those fans that are paying $99 to order the Mayweather-McGregor fight thinking it's going to be an exciting fight.\n\nIf it ends up being a mismatch, it's not going to present a pretty picture after the fight. That's why it's never a good thing for fighters to focus on greed by setting up mismatches against novices like McGregor. If the UFC fighter had at least fought one fight in a boxing ring against a quality opponent before the Mayweather fight, would let the fans know that this isn't just a rip off payday for Mayweather and McGregor.\n\nIf Mayweather felt like he owed the fans, he should have paid them back already by making his fight against Andre Berto exciting. That was supposed to be the fight in which Mayweather paid the boxing public back for his boring fight against Pacquiao. In many ways, Mayweather-Berto was FAR more boring than Mayweather's fight against Manny Pacquiao.\n\nAt least in the Pacquiao fight, he was pushing the action with one healthy arm, trying to force Mayweather to fight him. Pacquiao tried his best, but he was fighting with an injured shoulder and he couldn't do much. Berto didn't have the boxing skills or the motivation to try and push the fight against Mayweather. We certainly didn't see Mayweather trying to make it exciting against Berto.\n\nMayweather looked half asleep and lazy in that fight. The thing is, Mayweather had told the boxing fans ahead of time that the Berto fight would be an exciting one. Mayweather failed to live up to his promises. Now the fans are expected to believe him this time that his fight against McGregor will be action packed, and will end with a knockout. If there is going to be a knockout in that fight, I suspect that it'll be the 29-year-old McGregor who will be scoring it.\n\n\"I don't think he wants to lose 90 per cent of his money, or even more,\" said Mayweather. \"Yes, I don't like him at all.\"\n\nHonestly, who cares whether Mayweather likes McGregor or not. The boxing world wants to see a good fight for a change involving Mayweather instead of yet another boring fight. Last time Mayweather was involved in an exciting fight was in 2012 when he fought Miguel Cotto. Every fight since then has been boring.", "id": "9557999", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Mayweather: I'm going straight at McGregor \" Boxing News", "image": "http://www.boxingnews24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1-Mayweather_vs_McGregor_WorldTour_NY-23.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1324, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1333}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}, "id": "308747", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}, "id": "387933", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Victor Ortiz"}, "id": "390609", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Ortiz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andre Berto"}, "id": "390617", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Berto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headbutt"}, "id": "390618", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headbutt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 169, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1157, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Furry", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Furry"}], "time": "20:17:00"}

The fight matches an Irish UFC champion in his first professional boxing match against a fighter who was throwing punches before he could walk and who won all 49 of his pro fights before announcing his retirement.\n\nBut commission members -- who regulate both UFC and boxing in Nevada -- are charged with protecting the health and safety of fighters. Their No. 1 job is to make sure as few fighters as possible get their brains scrambled in the ring or in the octagon.\n\nAnd in this case, they failed.\n\nThe NSAC have approved 8oz gloves for the fight (Getty)\n\nIt was bad enough that the commission approved a novice boxer to go 12 rounds with one of the best fighters of all time, no questions asked. But commission members lost any remaining credibility when they agreed to change the glove size for no real reason other than the two fighters asked for it to help build the hype.\n\nIn doing so, they ignored a letter from the Association of Ringside Physicians asking them not to.\n\n\"We hated to see them break their own rules and regulations kind of arbitrarily,\" said Dr. Larry Lovelace, who heads the association and is also on the Oklahoma State Boxing Commission. \"It seemed almost capricious to change from 10 ounces, which is the prescribed weight of gloves for that weight class.\"\n\nTo be fair, there is no solid medical evidence about the effects of getting hit with smaller gloves. But there was enough anecdotal evidence that the Nevada commission in 2006 adopted regulations that call for 8-ounce gloves in fights 147 pounds or smaller, and 10-ounce gloves for anything above that.\n\nIn the 11 years since, that has been the rule. Until Wednesday, there had been no exceptions.\n\nBut tickets and pay-per-view had to be sold. More people had to be convinced that McGregor actually has a chance in the ring with Mayweather.\n\nThe fight is yet to sell out (Getty)\n\nAnd convinced they were, at least the ones betting at William Hill. Oddsmakers there lowered the lopsided odds favoring Mayweather from minus-600 to minus-550 because they will be fighting with smaller gloves.\n\nMcGregor himself predicted the smaller gloves would make the night even easier for him.\n\n\"I believe now that gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said. \"I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMost in boxing scoff at that, saying the size of the gloves would matter only if they were both forced to fight in 4-ounce UFC gloves that are open past the knuckle. There's also a school of thought that smaller gloves will actually help Mayweather by making his hands even quicker.\n\nBut by allowing smaller gloves, commission members did more than just try to lure a few more people to Las Vegas next week. They made a decision that, in theory at least, could affect the outcome of the fight.\n\nAnd by any standard, that's a bad decision to make.\n\nMore about: UFC Floyd Mayweather Conor McGregor Mayweather vs McGregor Nevada State Athletic Commission Dana White Las Vegas Reuse content", "id": "9876242", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Mayweather and McGregor should not be allowed to fight in 8oz gloves", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/18/11/mcgregor-may-black-and-white.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}, "id": "305090", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "id": "310320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Getty family"}, "id": "342859", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_family"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Aldo"}, "id": "361906", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Aldo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 407, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Consulting", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Consulting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 898, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation"}], "time": "10:12:00"}

While the two heralded fighters were originally slated to use 10-ounce gloves due to the looming 154-pound weight limit, the Nevada Athletic Commission has since amended a previous rule -- unanimously might I add -- in order to allow smaller gloves inside the ring on August 26 in Las Vegas.\n\nAccording to the regulations set by the Nevada Athletic Commission, eight-ounce gloves are not to be used in boxing matches contested at more than 147 pounds. On the other hand, for boxing matches fought at 135 pounds or less, eight-ounce gloves must be used with either eight-ounce or 10-ounce gloves traditionally used for bouts that range between 135 and 147 pounds.\n\nMarnell: I am in favour of allowing a 1 approval.

If it's not coming directly from me, then it's not true. I'm telling McGregor, \"Let's fight in 8 oz gloves.\"\n\nAvansino: Let's not change the long standing rule, but because this is a hybrid fight, perhaps we can consider a one fight exception.\n\n-- TheMacLife (@Maclifeofficial) August 16, 2017\n\nSince mixed martial artists such as McGregor typically use four-ounce gloves inside \"The Octagon,\" many believe that the Wednesday morning decision significantly favors \"The Notorious,\" who is often regarded for his knockout power. However, others believes that the two-ounce reduction won't make much of a difference for Mayweather as he has used eight-ounce gloves as a result of 48 of his 49 career bouts.\n\nIt has also been announced that Robert Byrd will serve as the match's referee with the trio of Burt Clements, Dave Moretti and Guido Cavalleri as the judges.\n\nRelated Items:Boxing, FRS News, Todays MMA News, UFC", "id": "9579757", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "NAC rules in favor of eight-ounce gloves for McGregor-Mayweather bout", "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/11192446/AP_17224052404185.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 532, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 541}, {"textStart": 1103, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1118}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1213, "date": "2017-08-01", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1221}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blog"}, "id": "305393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Publicity stunt"}, "id": "406017", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicity_stunt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punching power"}, "id": "420928", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punching_power"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1315, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Communication Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders"}], "time": "16:23:00"}

Mayweather and McGregor's Showtime pay-per-view superfight on Aug. 26 will be contested at the junior middleweight limit of 154 pounds.\n\nHowever, both fighters submitted official requests to the commission stating their desire to compete in smaller, 8-ounce gloves.\n\nIn a shocking decision, the NSAC agreed to the fighters' request and granted an exception to its own rule.\n\nGlove size has been a constant issue in the long war of words between Mayweather and McGregor. From the beginning, McGregor has been pushing for the smallest gloves possible because smaller gloves have less padding and thus accentuate his significant punching power. McGregor has made a name for himself in the UFC with show-stopping knock-outs delivered with the sport's traditional 4-ounce gloves.\n\nMayweather, goaded on by McGregor's taunts, publicly stated that he'd be fine with the smaller gloves safe in the knowledge that Nevada's own rules would assuredly protect him.\n\nMcGregor, who is also known for making wild predictions about his fights that often end up being true, said Friday that the 8-ounce gloves would be the end of Mayweather.\n\n\"If we're 8 ounces I'm struggling to give him two rounds,\" McGregor said at his media workout. \"That's the God's honest truth.

He has added yoga to his regimen, and employs a team of professionals to keep his body tuned up.\n\nBut as he approaches the richest fight of his career -- an Aug. 26 boxing match against UFC champ Conor McGregor -- Mayweather maintains he's a diminished fighter.\n\n\"I'm just being honest,\" he told reporters during Thursday's media conference call. \"I don't think I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago . . . I'm not even the same Floyd Mayweather that I was five or two years ago. But I still have a high IQ in that ring. Experience-wise, it leans towards me.\"\n\nIt still isn't clear whether Mayweather, undefeated in 49 bouts, is downplaying his skills to gin up interest in a cross-genre bout that projects as a mismatch. But McGregor, a mixed martial arts fighter who has never boxed professionally, is amping up his trash talk, predicting Wednesday he'd finish Mayweather within two rounds.\n\nLast week, a short video surfaced of McGregor pot-shotting retired boxer Paulie Malignaggi during a sparring session, along with another clip showing him sending Malignaggi to the canvas.\n\nMalignaggi says 30 seconds of video culled from a 12-round session reveal nothing, and replays show McGregor dragged the boxer down rather than dropping him with a punch. But the footage has convinced UFC president Dana White that McGregor is equipped to topple Mayweather.\n\n\"I want him to win and I expect him to win,\" White told reporters during McGregor's conference call on Wednesday. \"I expect him to knock Floyd Mayweather out.\"\n\nMayweather told reporters he's seen the videos and isn't impressed.\n\n\"It only counts once you get under those lights,\" Mayweather said. \"That's just the gym.\"\n\nBut the videos and the Nevada State Athletic Commission's decision to allow the fighters to downsize from 10-ounce to eight-ounce gloves have bettors sharing White's optimism about McGregor. Before the fight was officially announced, Mayweather was a 25-to-1 favourite, but by Thursday afternoon a steady stream of McGregor money shortened those odds to 4-to-1.\n\nDuring Thursday's conference call, Mayweather and his team pointed out that the fighter is the beneficiary of one of the smartest bets in sports history.\n\nIn 2006, Mayweather paid $750,000 (all dollar figures U.S.) to void the remainder of his promotional contract with Top Rank, becoming his own promoter and going on to make more money than any fighter before him. Mayweather grossed a reported $200 million for his 2015 win over Manny Pacquiao.\n\n\"Without the courage to make that move, without the foresight to make the move, nothing of the rest of this is possible,\" said Showtime Sports executive VP Steven Espinoza. \"It all starts with taking risks. No one has this level of success without taking a risk.\"\n\nWhether or not he wins in the ring, Mayweather's latest gamble -- ending a two-year retirement to fight a UFC star -- will pay off financially. Earlier this week, Mayweather told talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that next week's fight will earn him $350 million, and added that he plans to place a cash wager on himself.\n\n\"I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks,\" Mayweather said on the conference call. \"I don't mind putting everything on the line for this fight.

Mayweather and McGregor's Showtime pay-per-view superfight on August 27 will be contested at the junior middleweight limit of 154 pounds.\n\nHowever, both fighters submitted official requests to the commission stating their desire to compete in smaller, eight-ounce gloves.\n\nIn a shocking decision, the NSAC agreed to the fighters' request and granted an exception to its own rule.\n\nGlove size has been a constant issue in the long war of words between Mayweather and McGregor.\n\nFrom the beginning, McGregor has been pushing for the smallest gloves possible because smaller gloves have less padding and thus accentuate his significant punching power. McGregor has made a name for himself in the UFC with showstopping knockouts delivered with the sport's traditional four-ounce gloves.\n\nMayweather, goaded by McGregor's taunts, publicly stated that he'd be fine with the smaller gloves, safe in the knowledge that Nevada's own rules would assuredly protect him.\n\nMcGregor, who is also known for making wild predictions about his fights that often end up being true, said last week that the eight-ounce gloves would be the end of Mayweather.\n\n\"If we're eight ounces, I'm struggling to give him two rounds,\" McGregor said at his media workout. \"That's the God's honest truth.

The UFC lightweight champion has scrapped his original prediction of a knockout within four rounds, vowing to stop the undefeated boxer within the bout's first six minutes.\n\nMcGregor's latest comments came with the ruling by the Nevada State Athletic Commission to allow the fighters to use eight-ounce gloves instead of 10-ounce gloves. Even though NSCA regulations require 10-ounce gloves for any bout above the welterweight limit of 147 pounds, an exception will be made for next week's 154-pound fight.\n\n\"If we are in 8-ounce gloves, he will be floored multiple times in the first round,\" McGregor told ESPN last week. \"I believe first-round KO in 8-ounce gloves. The fact I can't follow through in MMA and pound the head into the canvas and there's a 10-count in boxing, maybe I'll give him second round. But 8-ounce gloves, he will be done in two.\"\n\nConor McGregor: &quot;Now that gloves are 8 ounces, I don&#39;t think he makes it out of the second round&quot; #UFC #Boxing #MayMac\n\n&mdash; Damon Martin (@DamonMartin) August 16, 2017\n\nMcGregor is used to fighting with four-ounce gloves in the UFC, and he made it clear during the press tour that 10-ounce gloves were too heavy for his liking. On Aug. 1, Mayweather announced on social media that he would have no trouble accommodating his opponent.\n\nUsing eight-ounce gloves is nothing new for Mayweather. It's what he's used in almost every one of his fights, with the one exception coming four years ago against Canelo Alvarez when he cruised to a victory at 152 pounds.\n\n\"I was already up 6 ounces from 4 to 10, so it's down a little bit from 10 to 8,\" McGregor said during a media call Wednesday afternoon. \"How often he's worn the gloves or any of that doesn't really factor into - I didn't even know that, for instance. So that didn't factor into my thoughts at all. I do not care about his record, I do not care about his achievements, every fight is on a fight by fight basis so that's how we approach it.\"\n\nThe betting public seems to agree with McGregor that smaller gloves give him a better chance to win. His odds have improved to +325 with the latest news, via OddsShark, moving from +350 just a few days earlier. McGregor was a +500 underdog when the fight was announced on July 14.\n\nMcGregor became the first fighter in UFC history to hold two titles simultaneously by showcasing his knockout power. He stopped Jose Aldo in 13 seconds to win the UFC featherweight championship at UFC 194, and he needed less than two rounds to beat Eddie Alvarez for the UFC lightweight championship 11 months later.\n\nConor McGregor, pictured during a media workout at the UFC Performance Institute on Aug. 11, 2017 in Las Vegas, had predicted that he'll knock out Floyd Mayweather within two rounds. Photo: Getty Images\n\nMcGregor's prediction of beating Mayweather within the first two rounds might be bold, though it's in line with what he's done as an MMA fighter. He's won by knockout in six of his last eight fights, and none of those bouts have made it to the third round.\n\nNext week, the UFC star will try to do the impossible. Not only has Mayweather never been beaten in 49 career fights, but he's only suffered one official knockdown in his entire career.\n\nMayweather hasn't knocked out a fighter since he defeated Victor Ortiz six years ago with a controversial knockout.", "id": "9699582", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Conor McGregor Prediction: Floyd Mayweather Won't Last Two Rounds, Says UFC Star",

Baskow\n\nConor McGregor breaks into a dance during a media workout before a large crowd within the gym at the UFC Performance Institute on Friday, August 11, 2017.\n\nBy Jesse Granger (contact)\n\nThursday, Aug. 17, 2017 | 2 a.m.\n\nConor McGregor Media Workout Launch slideshow \" Related content Analysis: Age shows no sign of affecting Floyd Mayweather at open workout Mayweather promoter tired of talk about ticket sales Mayweather-McGregor to be shown live in movie theaters The Sun's fighting section\n\nFloyd Mayweather's 49-0 boxing record is littered with win against sport's legends.\n\nOscar De La Hoya, Marcos Maidana, Canelo Alvarez, Miguel Cotto, Shane Mosley and Manny Pacquiao all lay in Mayweather's wake during his undefeated career spanning two decades.\n\nBut mixed martial artist Conor McGregor, who is set to make his boxing debut against Mayweather Aug. 26 at T-Mobile Arena, isn't a boxer and he believes that is his advantage.\n\n\"You can't prepare for me,\" McGregor said. \"You can't prepare for the movement or any of it. Let him watch and try and study. There's no one in the game that moves like me, strikes like me or has the confidence like me.\"\n\nMcGregor has been continuously mocked by the boxing community for everything from his warmup routine to his punching techniques.\n\nA mob of photographers huddled around the boxing ring, draped over the ropes to get a glimpse of McGregor as he warmed up Friday at the UFC Performance Institute. The two-division UFC champion started by awkwardly flailing his arms to loosen them up before shadow boxing, which has drawn much criticism.\n\nWBC and WBO light welterweight boxing champion Terence Crawford parodied McGregor's rubber-armed exercise, challenging \"all boxers\" to the McGregor challenge and starting a viral sensation.\n\nCurrent and former boxers Gilbert Smith, Jarrett Hurd, Benny Mahoney and Kalvin Henderson all followed suit with their own videos mocking McGregor.\n\nMcGregor, though, believes he'll be getting the last laugh.\n\n\"I am just looking forward to post-fight educating the world once again what a true martial artist is,\" he said. \"I don't know how many times they've labeled me a joker. Then the poor guy that's in there with me has to deal with it, and then he's unconscious.\"\n\nMcGregor displayed an array of unorthodox strikes during his hour-long workout including leaping superman punches usually only seen in mixed martial arts.\n\n\"(My style) will be unusual to everyone watching and to Floyd of course, but that's not my problem,\" McGregor said. \"They will study it after it's done.\"\n\nMayweather is considered one of the best defensive fighters of all time. Pacquiao landed only 19 percent of his punches against him, and Alvarez did only slightly better with 22 percent. McGregor believes he owns an advantage by being so different from Mayweather's past opponents.\n\n\"It forces a man to react off my creation,\" McGregor said. \"When you're reacting and not creating you're in trouble. Factor in the punch power and precision and it's not going to end well for Floyd or the people that are doubting me.\"\n\nMcGregor is so green in the sport that he hired Hall of Fame Referee Joe Cortez to assist him with his training camp - teaching him the rules as he goes.\n\n\"Everything is legal that we've been doing,\" McGregor said. \"Of course I'm going to play to the rules, but I will implement my own stuff.\"\n\nOne man has already witnessed McGregor's awkward style. Former IBF and WBA champion Paul Malignaggi sparred with McGregor, and videos of McGregor knocking him down later surfaced on social media.\n\n\"The spars were not good for him,\" McGregor said. \"He took a lot of head trauma. The sparring partners told us when he was on his way home he was stumbling out of his car after the 12-rounder. He was badly concussed.\"\n\nMcGregor, who said he will have at least a 20-pound weight advantage, is also two inches taller and has a 2-inch reach advantage over Mayweather.\n\n\"He's too small,\" McGregor said. \"He's not going to take the shots. You ain't never seen me troubled by no small man like that. He's 150 pounds and I'm going to be 170 plus on the night.\"\n\nThe lead up to the fight has been as abnormal as McGregor's boxing techniques - from the press tour that visited three countries in four days, to the astronomical ticket prices for fight night.\n\nThe cheapest seat currently listed on Ticketmaster is $1,682, with ringside seats costing as much as $35,000. A seller on VividSeats.com has a ticket listed at an unrealistic $164,043 but crazier things have happened -- this fight for example.\n\nWhile the average ticket price of $3,684 is slightly less than Mayweather's 2015 fight with Pacquiao ($3,870) the overall ticket sales are on pace to be higher.\n\nLeonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, claims they have already sold $60 million in the box office - dwarfing the UFC's record of $17 million in McGregor's last fight against Eddie Alvarez, and on pace to break boxing's record of $72 million for Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao.\n\n\"Every day I wake up and I pinch myself,\" McGregor said. \"I've come from shows where I'm fighting in front of a 100 people, and 70 of them are family of the fighters. That was only four years ago.\"\n\nThe increased attention and pressure don't seem to bother McGregor.\n\n\"I'm being who I am,\" McGregor said. \"I'm working hard, I'm scheduling belts with opponents, I'm telling them what I'm going to do to them and then I'm doing it. From there the train just kind of rolls with it, and it picks up steam as the predictions come true.\"\n\nHis prediction for this fight is a bold one. McGregor said he'll knock Mayweather out in under four rounds, despite currently being a 5/1 underdog with most experts saying he has even less chance of winning. Former boxing great Mike Tyson said on Sirius XM radio, \"Conor McGregor is going to look really ridiculous boxing (Mayweather).\"\n\nMcGregor remains steadfast in his self confidence, quoting boxing legend Joe Frazier for what he believes will happen to Mayweather come fight night.\n\n\"His brain is already gonna be shook, his money is already gonna be took, and his name is already gonna be in the undertaker's book.\"\n\nJesse Granger can be reached at 702-259-8814 or [email protected].

Latest reports just claimed that there is a possibility that McGregor can beat Mayweather with some reasons elucidated.\n\nLess than two weeks away from the biggest fight in combat sports history, some fans and sports analysts are already giving their respective predictions. Though most bet for Mayweather, some are also betting on McGregor and they even cited reasons and factors why the MMA fighter can have the chance to beat the undefeated world boxing champion.\n\nFirst, it was mentioned on Bleacher Report that Mayweather has not trained even for a single second for this upcoming bout. Some said that he has been roller skating, shopping, and going to strip clubs instead of training while McGregor has been spending all his time training so he can win and beat Mayweather. However, it was till claimed that the boxing champ can still win the fight.\n\nSecond, Mayweather was compared to Paulie Malignaggi who was beaten by McGregor by pushing and knocking him down. It was claimed that Mayweather is not Malignaggi who is also a good boxer with a shot chin but still does nothing during his fight night with McGregor.\n\nNext, many were claiming that McGregor's success in MMA comes from his ability to get into the head of his opponent. The said MMA fighter can get fighters over emotional and this will end up to his rivals abandoning their game plan immediately the McGregor takes advantage of their mistakes. Perhaps, when he fights Mayweather, he will also employ the same tactic.\n\nBut according to Gwinnett Prep Sports, Mayweather has every advantage in this bout and he is aware of that so there is no reason for him to get over emotional or for him to even mind what McGregor will say or do. It will be very unlikely that he will submit to that, so still, Mayweather has the edge.\n\nLastly, with Mayweather's perfect record of 49-0, some said that he has been protected and that winning 49 professional fights is hard already. In addition, he also never lost a decision and that he has never been on the wrong side and with this, it will be doubtful if McGregor will ruin this record.", "id": "9740102", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "3 Reasons Mayweather Might Be Beaten By McGregor In Their Upcoming Combat Fight", "image": "http://images.enstarz.com/data/images/full/173509/full-interview-stephen-a-smith-sits-down-with-floyd-mayweather-one-on-one-espn.png", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 118, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 127}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roller skating"}, "id": "306117", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_skating"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strip club"}, "id": "312518", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_club"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}, "id": "329178", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of current world boxing champions"}, "id": "360100", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_world_boxing_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Undisputed champion"}, "id": "538089", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_Champion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 101, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 529, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 530, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 898, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 950, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods and Movements", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods_and_Movements"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "09:24:00"}

That's why this fight is exciting. Look at what happened to Pacquiao. Nobody gave [Horn] any chance in the fight, and then Pacquiao came out and lost.\"\n\nPacquiao himself is not so sure and believes McGregor can only win if he gets \"lucky,\" reports The Sun.\n\n\"McGregor has no chance in this fight,\" said the Filipino great.\n\n\"Pacquiao also questioned McGregor's professional experience and stressed the difficulty of the task in hand,\" says the paper.\n\n\"There is no way he will be able to land a meaningful punch on Floyd...

Despite the gloves being smaller than would be deemed usual for fighting at this weight, they are not almost as small as the ones McGregor is used to wearing, however the Irishman has since expressed his delight at the decision.

The fight will be taking place in his domain, where he hasn't tasted defeat in 49 professional bouts. Mayweather has breezed past some of the greatest boxers of our generation while we've only seen 20 seconds of McGregor sparring retired pugilist Paulie Malignaggi.\n\nIt's also fair to say that in terms of pure boxing, Mayweather has considerably more skill than McGregor. However, those who fancy McGregor's chances will argue that the key to victory for McGregor is to fight Mayweather outside of what is considered to be 'good boxing' within the ruleset.\n\nHowever, it is also true that McGregor is younger, taller, has a longer reach and is just a bigger man than 'Money'. Although the latest prediction from both camps suggests his weight advantage on fight night won't be too crazy.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Mayweather isn't bulking up in preparation for the Irish knockout artist. At the NSAC meeting on Wednesday where the officials and glove size were decided for the bout, a representative of his team revealed that he is on course to tip the scales at 150 lbs and is expected the weigh the exact same on fight night.\n\nWe're used to seeing McGregor cut large amounts of weight in the UFC, but as it stands, his weight is supposedly quite low. McGregor's representative at the meeting, former UFC executive Michael Mersch, explained that McGregor is expected to make the 154 lb weight limit relatively easy.\n\nMersch claimed that McGregor weighed 160 lbs 10 days out from the fight and he is expected to weigh roughly the same once he steps inside the ring.\n\nIf you are to believe Mersch, McGregor will have roughly 10 lbs on Mayweather on the night of the fight.", "id": "9740068", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Conor McGregor's team predicts sizeable, but not staggering weight advantage | SportsJOE.ie", "image": "https://img.maximummedia.ie/sportsjoe_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvbWVkaWEtc3BvcnRzam9lLm1heGltdW1tZWRpYS5pZS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE3XFxcLzA4XFxcLzE2MTczNTU2XFxcL01heU1hYy13ZWlnaHQtMTAyNHg1MDQuanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LnNwb3J0c2pvZS5pZVxcXC9hc3NldHNcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL3Nwb3J0c2pvZVxcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj0zXCJ9IiwiaGFzaCI6IjEzYWNjNDA5ODIwNWIwY2FmYzFhMGEwNzQxNmNmZWI3YThhYjFjZDUifQ==/maymac-weight-1024x504.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Grand Duchy of Luxembourg"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mersch"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "112245", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersch", "label": {"eng": "Mersch"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 403, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain Names", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain_Names"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 578, "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 579, "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss/Personal Pages", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss/Personal_Pages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 580, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight Loss", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight_Loss"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "07:24:00"}

Both fighters submitted a waiver to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, who approved the request on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Nevada commission voted unanimously to approve the one-time exception to its own regulations, which state any boxing match contested above 147 pounds mandates 10-ounce gloves.\n\nThe 29-year-old McGregor (21-3), who is the UFC's lightweight champion, uses 4-ounce gloves in mixed martial arts bouts. He was quick to respond to the social media post, saying he didn't care about glove size and pointed to Mayweather's \"brittle hands.\"\n\n\"Floyd wants him to have every advantage possible that he can have,\" Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe told MMA Junkie. \"Conor is a very confident young man, and I'm fully confident he's going to lay it on the line. He's representing not only the UFC brand, but he's representing his country. He has the great fans from his country. They will be there backing him, and the millions of fans across the world will be tuned in watching this terrific event. We're excited.\"\n\n\"I think it will have an impact on the fight. From a fighter's perspective, you're more comfortable with fighting the smaller gloves. I'm pretty confident the fight will end in a knockout. Pretty confident. It's something Conor wanted, something Floyd wanted, and both fighters got exactly what they wanted.\n\n\"Conor has guaranteed he's going to knock Floyd out within four rounds. He just recently said he's struggling to give him two rounds now. I fully expect him to be a man of his word and come out and be very aggressive in the small gloves. Floyd will be very aggressive, and it's going to be a great fight. We've got a fight, ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\nNeither fighter has competed this year. Mayweather retired from professional boxing after defeating Andre Berto in September 2015 while McGregor bested Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205 in November 2016.\n\nTags: Floyd Mayweather Jr. Conor McGregor Mayweather vs. McGregor", "id": "9586584", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Ellerbe: Smaller Gloves Will Have Impact on Mayweather-McGregor", "image": "http://photo.boxingscene.com/uploads/mayweather-mcgregor%20(8)_6.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 146, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 153}, {"textStart": 2113, "date": "2015-09-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2127}, {"textStart": 2178, "date": "2016-11-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2191}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "id": "302718", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}, "id": "347122", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing glove"}, "id": "419805", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "MMAjunkie.com"}, "id": "549013", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMAjunkie.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mayweather Promotions"}, "id": "1301253", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayweather_Promotions"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 898, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "00:07:00"}

Here's a profile of Robert Byrd.\n\nMayweather vs McGregor: From trash-talk to super-fight 18 show all Mayweather vs McGregor: From trash-talk to super-fight 1/18 From trash-talk to super-fight\n\nJust how did an appearance on late-night show Conan and a rumbling Twitter feud turn into the biggest fight the sport of boxing has ever known.\n\nHere, we tell the story of how the trash-talk turned into a super-fight.\n\nGetty Images\n\n2/18 McGregor appears on Conan\n\n\"If you're asking would I like to fight Floyd Mayweather, I mean, who would not like to dance around the ring for $180m?\" McGregor replied to a playful question from late-night host Conan O'Brien, in July 2015, on whether he would ever be tempted into switching sports.\n\n\"I would certainly box him if the opportunity arose,\" he smiled.\n\n\"Most certainly.\"\n\n3/18 Mayweather's observation\n\nMayweather then rekindled the speculation, that December. In an interview with FightHype on the worldwide adulation McGregor had received for knocking out Aldo in just 13 seconds, the American complained that he would never receive such acclaim from the public because of the colour of his skin.\n\n\"They say he talk a lot of trash and people praise him for it, but when I did it, they say I'm cocky and arrogant,\" Mayweather observed.\n\n\"So biased! Like I said before, all I'm saying is this, I ain't racist at all, but I'm telling you racism still exists.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\n4/18 \"I am an Irishman\"\n\nThis time, it didn't take the other man the best part of half a year to respond. \"Don't ever bring my race into my success again,\" McGregor commented in a long Instagram post, the very next day.\n\n\"I am an Irishman. My people have been oppressed our entire existence. And still very much are. I understand the feeling of prejudice. It is a feeling that is deep in my blood ... If you want we can organise a fight no problem. I will give you a fair 80/20 split purse in my favour seen as your last fight bombed at every area of revenue.\"\n\nA feud was born.\n\n5/18 McGregor 'retires'\n\nAs interest in a fight with Mayweather began to increase, McGregor threatened to retire not just from MMA, but from sport altogether.\n\nUFC president Dana White announced that the promotion has pulled McGregor from the main event at UFC 200, because of his refusal to participate in mandatory media duties. McGregor's response?\n\n\"I have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya's later.\"\n\n6/18 Scoop\n\nThings came to a boil in May 2016. British tabloid The Sun reported that the two men were \"on the verge\" of agreeing to a deal, with an unnamed source telling the paper that \"Floyd is obsessed with making Conor eat his words\".\n\nThe story attracted so much attention that Dana White, the president of the UFC, felt compelled to finally address the situation. He laughed off suggestions the super-fight would ever take place, instead pointing out that McGregor was contracted to the UFC, and would thus be in breach of contract should he attempt to organise a fight himself away from the confines of the Octagon.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\n7/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters\n\nWhite's comments appeared to spur both men into action. First McGregor tweeted a mocked up fight poster with the caption 'MMA vs Boxing'...\n\nGetty Images\n\n8/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters\n\n... before Mayweather responded with an effort of his own (it wasn't quite as good).\n\nMayweather insisted began to insist a fight was \"possible\". Then he told a journalist that he was a retired man and would only countenance returning to professional sport in order to fight McGregor. And then he pressed the nuclear button, offering the Irishman just $50m to fight him in what people were already describing as a billion-dollar bout.\n\nGetty Images\n\n9/18 Leonard Ellerbe puts his foot down\n\nHold the hype. Just as things were beginning to heat up, Mayweather's promotions head, Leonard Ellerbe, poured cold water on the prospective fight, insisting it was \"a calculated effort by McGregor to gain more fans\".\n\nGetty Images\n\n10/18 Mac gets personal\n\nIn an attempt to get discussions back on track, McGregor got personal.\n\n\"Call me CJ Watson!\" he tweet, with a cartoon of him standing triumphantly above a knocked out Mayweather.\n\nThe caption was explosive: Mayweather was sent to prison in 2010 for the assault of his then-girlfriend. He was reportedly angry about text messages she had received from NBA star CJ Watson.\n\nGetty Images\n\n11/18 White rebuffed\n\nAt this point in the saga the president of the UFC, Dana White, reenters the fray.\n\nHaving previously insisted that the fight was a non-starter, he suddenly proposed a deal: $25m for each fighter, with the complicated PPV splits to be patiently worked out at a later date.\n\n\"He's a f***ing comedian,\" Mayweather replied.\n\nGetty Images\n\n12/18 In February 2017...\n\n... McGregor arrived in Las Vegas, to much excitement.\n\nMayweather tweeted the following.\n\nGetty Images\n\n13/18 Conor's response\n\nMcGregor's response to Mayweather's short statement was brutal and to the point.\n\n\"I am in Las Vegas. Floyd has retired on my arrival,\" he observed.\n\n14/18 Conan's back!\n\nWithout Conan O'Brien the biggest fight in the history of boxing would still be a daydream.\n\nIn March he invited Dana White onto his show, who said the following.\n\n\"I do think it's gonna happen. I think it's going to be a tough deal because obviously [there are] a lot of egos involved in this deal and a lot of people, so that always makes it tougher.\n\n\"On the flip side, there's so much money involved. I just don't see how it doesn't happen.\"\n\n15/18 Conor and Conlan\n\nMcGrgor was in New York to support Belfast boxer Michael Conlan in his professional debut against Tim Ibarra in March.\n\nBut the spotlight quickly sought him out. He reminded everyone that an announcement was imminent by shouting furiously into the face of ESPN boxing reporter Dan Rafael: \"I AM BOXING!\"\n\nGetty Images\n\n16/18 Fine downgraded\n\nOn March 22, an outstanding fine McGregor had with the Nevada Athletic Commission was downgraded, paving the way for the Irishman to obtain his necessary boxing license.\n\nGetty Images\n\n17/18 McGregor confirms\n\nOn Wednesday 14 June, the fight was finally confirmed by both men.\n\n\"THE FIGHT IS ON,\" McGregor posted on Twitter, along with a mocking picture of himself side-by-side with Floyd Mayweather Snr.\n\n18/18 Mayweather confirms\n\n\"It's official!\" replied Mayweather on Instagram, along with a short promotional video confirming the involvement of Showtime.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWho is Robert Byrd?\n\nA 74-year-old former Californian police officer, Byrd is one of the Nevada State Athletic Commission's most experienced and respected referees.\n\nByrd also worked as a referee and a judge in boxing in California, before he resettled in the state of Nevada.\n\nByrd is one of the NSAC's most experienced referees (Getty)\n\nThe veteran referee is also very familiar with the sport of mixed martial arts on account of his wife, Adalaide.\n\nShe is a respected boxing referee herself and has also worked as a MMA judge since 2006, judging at high-profile events including UFC 196 (when Nate Diaz stunned McGregor) and UFC 202 (when McGregor seized his revenge).\n\nWhat previous fights has he taken charge of?\n\nBryd has only taking charge of one previous Mayweather fight - the American's unanimous decision win over Robert Guerrero in May 2013.\n\nThe American also refereed Andre Ward's first win over Sergey Kovalev, as well as Saul Canelo Alvarez's memorable victory over Miguel Cotto.\n\nThose with exceptionally long memories may also recall Byrd taking charge of Wladimir Klitschko's fight against Lamon Brewster back in 2004, which the Ukrainian shockingly lost. It was Klitschko's most recent defeat until Tyson Fury outpointed him in 2015.\n\nHe has refereed one previous Mayweather fight (Getty) Who are the judges?\n\nBurt Clements and Dave Moretti - both from the United States - and Italy's Guido Cavalleri have all been appointed to score the 12-round fight at the T-Mobile Arena.\n\nMoretti is exceptionally familiar with Mayweather, having scored 11 of his previous fights including five consecutively (Andre Berto, Manny Pacquiao, Marcos Maidana I and II, Canelo Alvarez).\n\nClements has judged four previous Mayweather fights, with Italy's Cavalleri judging just one - the Maidana rematch.\n\nAll of the judges have scored Mayweather fight before (Getty)\n\nWhy is Kenny Bayless not refereeing?\n\nBayless has taken charge of a number of Mayweather's fights - including his contests against Berto, Pacquiao and Canelo.\n\nHowever, in the months ahead of the fight Bayless was filmed offering his extremely negative opinions on Mayweather vs McGregor, declaring that he \"did not see the point\" in the super-fight.\n\nThat did not go down well with the Irishman's camp. Dana White registered his objections to Bayless on social media, while McGregor commented at a media day that he wanted another referee to take charge of the contest.\n\n\"His views ... he went public on what he thought the fight was,\" McGregor told reporters. \"He can't be involved in the event.\"\n\nThe NSAC appeared to listen to McGregor's appeal. Shortly before their monthly meeting, their executive director confirmed that he had eliminated the possibility of Bayless being handed the fight.\n\nMore about: UFC Floyd Mayweather Conor McGregor

The lighter gloves have less padding over the knuckles and are believed to favour the heavier puncher,\" says the BBC.\n\nThat is likely to be Irishman McGregor, who's used to wearing fingerless four-ounce gloves in UFC bouts. He has welcomed the decision.\n\nLast week he told ESPN: \"If we are in eight-ounce gloves, [Mayweather] will be floored multiple times in the first round.\" McGregor predicted the bout would end in a first-round knockout.\n\n\"The fact I can't follow through [as I can] in MMA and pound the head into the canvas and there's a ten-count in boxing, maybe I'll give him second round. But eight-ounce gloves, he will be done in two.\"\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Mayweather also gave his support to the application. He has spent most of his career boxing at 147lb or below and has worn light gloves in 46 of his 49 fights.\n\nBut the move goes against the wishes of the ARP, which aims to protect the welfare of boxers.\n\n\"Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of this bout, we would strongly caution against allowing current regulation to be overruled. To do so would also set a precedent for future bouts,\" said the organisation.\n\nDespite their plea, the Nevada authorities have approved the smaller gloves, \"but not before chastising the two camps for using the issue as a pawn in social media to try and sell tickets for the event\", says The Guardian.\n\nBoth sides have been active on Instagram and Twitter in recent days as the build-up to the fight intensifies and rumours of sluggish ticket sales persist.\n\nAt the meeting this week, the Nevada State Athletic Commission also confirmed Robert Byrd as the referee for the clash. It glossed over concerns about glove weight by insisting that the official in the ring was the most important factor in ensuring the health and safety of the fighters.", "id": "9726628", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "McGregor vs Mayweather: Safety fears over eight-ounce gloves", "image": "http://cdn1.theweek.co.uk/sites/theweek/files/2017/07/170712-maygregor.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}, "id": "303358", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"}, {"label": {"eng": "Physician"}, "id": "303806", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "id": "305867", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Light middleweight"}, "id": "315817", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_middleweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 470, "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "15:54:00"}

I guess if you start your professional career with a 49-0 record, you don't switch up the formula for fight No. 50.\n\nApparently, Mayweather believes in the old-school boxing concept of avoiding intercourse in the lead-up to a fight. Approached by TMZ with a number of questions about the fight, Mayweather only gave a strong answer to one question.\n\n\"Floyd, are you going to abstain from sex before the fight?\" asked TMZ's correspondent. His response was unequivocal: \"Absolutely!\"\n\nThis unofficial vow marks a pretty stark contrast between Mayweather and his upcoming opponent, Conor McGregor. Pressed on the same subject by late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien, McGregor said in 2015 that he doesn't buy into that no-sex nonsense. \"That is most certainly a superstition that I do not abide by,\" said McGregor. \"I definitely have as much sex as possible.\"\n\nAs if we needed another point of division to talk about with this fight, the sex habits of both men are now clearly on display. Forget the difference in their sparring habits and their various, problematic actions outside the ring: this will surely be the thing that decides who will walk away from the ring victorious.\n\nIn more pressing news, Mayweather is doing his best to make sure fans stay interested in his upcoming bout with McGregor, as the odds continue to favor the 49-0 boxer heavily over the converted MMA fighter. Known mostly for his defensive prowess, Mayweather promised on a recent episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live that he was going to go after McGregor early and often.\n\n\"He's going to land shots, because with this fight, I'm going straight ahead,\" Mayweather said. \"Normally, it's more taking my time, being very cautious.

McGregor, after all, has never had a professional boxing match, while Mayweather carries a 49-0 record into the fight, which will be broadcast on pay-per-view television. If Mayweather was fighting under mixed martial arts rules, he'd be just as heavy an underdog to McGregor.\n\nWe're not going to tell you to put money down on the 'dog in a fight, which is such an on-paper mismatch, but if you were going to try convincing yourself that McGregor could pull off a Super Bowl III-like upset, here are five reasons:\n\n1. Size: The matchup is being conducted at 154 pounds. Mayweather started his career at 130 pounds, and while he's fought as high as 154, he conducted the bulk of his prime at welterweight (147 pounds). McGregor, meanwhile, has alternated between featherweight (145 pounds; MMA and boxing weight classes differ in size) and lightweight (155) for the bulk of his career. In 2016, in his two biggest career MMA fights, McGregor fought Nate Diaz at welterweight (170 pounds in MMA). McGregor also made fun of Mayweather during their promotional tour in July for wearing what appeared to be lifts in his sneakers to make him appear to be McGregor's size. With a day to rehydrate following weigh-ins and bell time, it is highly likely McGregor will have a significant size advantage by the time they step into the ring.\n\n2. A crushing left hand: Mayweather's a conventional fighter and has had his share of trouble with left-handers over his career. Notably, early on, both Jose Luis Castillo and Zab Judah gave Mayweather fits, although he made adjustments on the fly and earned the victory. McGregor, meanwhile, has absolutely crumpled opponents in the Octagon while wearing four-ounce gloves. Jose Aldo, featherweight champion for six years, saw his reign end in 13 seconds when he walked straight into a McGregor left. Eddie Alvarez, a hard-nosed lightweight champion in several organizations, had no answer for McGregor at UFC 205 in dropping the title. Landing on Mayweather is easier said than done, but the Irishman has already shown he has the power: McGregor's promoter, Dana White, leaked footage of McGregor rocking former world champion Paulie Malignaggi with a wicked left and then dropping him during a recent sparring session.\n\n3. Age and inactivity: McGregor is just coming into the prime of his fighting career, having turned 28 last month. Mayweather, meanwhile, turned 40 in February. He hasn't fought since Sept. 12, 2015, when he won a unanimous decision over Andre Berto, then retired with a 49-0 record. When fighters drop off, it tends to happen in a hurry. Ring rust is a real thing. There's no guarantee, now that he's on the other side of 40, that Mayweather will show up after a two-year break and suddenly return to peak form.\n\n4. Overconfidence: Maybe Mayweather will believe the hype. Maybe he truly believes that all he has to do is show up and the rest will take care of itself. Maybe he'll abandon his trademark patience and go headhunting, looking to defend the honor of boxing against an MMA intruder, and leave himself open for a counter knockout. McGregor has made a career out of being underestimated, and Mayweather would make for his biggest scalp.\n\n5. Self-belief: Just five years ago, McGregor was on the public dole in Ireland, as the Dublin native was trying to make ends meet in one of Dublin's rougher parts of town. He went from there to UFC success, winning the featherweight title against a dominant longtime champion in Aldo, who came into their December 2015 bout with an unbeatable aura. When McGregor was submitted by Diaz at welterweight in a short-notice bout for his only UFC loss, McGregor insisted upon having an immediate rematch, also at welterweight, even though Diaz was the larger man. And McGregor won the rematch. He then insisted he was going to become the first simultaneous, two-weight-class champion in the UFC's 24-year history, and went out and knocked out Alvarez to win the lightweight belt while still holding featherweight gold (which he has since vacated). McGregor also willed the Mayweather fight into existence, getting the UFC to alter policy on fighters taking outside bouts and making \"McGregor Promotions\" a co-promoter. When McGregor aims high, he usually hits, and that's as good a reason as any to believe he can win the fight.", "id": "9740067", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Five reasons why UFC

That's a big change for him - as opposed to dropping down two more ounces and going to eight. It works much better for Conor in that regard and that was his camp's position.\n\nAnd for Floyd, Floyd fought most of his career at 147lbs (welterweight) and used eight ounce gloves. I think there was only around three fights that he didn't use eight ounce gloves. Once was against Canelo (Alvarez), once was against (Miguel) Cotto and a long time ago was (Oscar) De La Hoya. But by in large, Floyd has always used eight ounce gloves and he hasn't really knocked anybody out in more than ten years - except Ricky Hatton.\n\nWe are always concerned about the health and safety of the fighter but based on the fact that both camps came forward and we were in a position to approve this on a one time approval based on a couple of stipulations, that being we see the gloves and expect them before the fight - which is normal for us anyway. We get to see the gloves seventy two hours in advance. We weigh them. We inspect them. But we also have to receive the gloves at the end of the fight - that being the gloves they wore and the alternate gloves and we will cut them open to make sure there's no horse hair in there and that the gloves are the way we inspected them beforehand.\n\nWe are also continuing to do a study to find out if there's really any scientific evidence that dictates going from eight to ten ounce gloves at 147lbs. We know it's a controversial issue but there is no scientific evidence at this stage of the game and that's because you know from being in the fight business, you throw a punch from a litany of angles and from varying degree of position.\"\n\nI then proceeded to ask Mr.Bennett could this case set a precedence for other fighters making similar requests in the future and was it something that worries the Commission going forward - to which he replied:\n\n\"Even though we are making this one fight exception, until our study is complete - it appears that the Chairman and the Commissioners are not going to approve anymore fights above 147lbs with eight ounce gloves until we complete the study. This rule obviously was put in place for the health and safety of the fighters but because this is sort of a historic anomaly of a fight with two disciplines, it kind of levels the playing field if you will.\"\n\nAs our conversation came towards an end I asked Bob did he know what brand of gloves will be used in the contest, to which he concluded:", "id": "9830364", "details": {"gpCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Exclusive: NSAC Defend Mayweather McGregor Gloves Ruling", "image": "https://www.boxingnewsandviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mayweather-mcgregor-gloves.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Evidence"}, "id": "315965", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight (MMA)"}, "id": "410149", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight_(MMA)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ricky Hatton"}, "id": "427870", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Hatton"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bob Bennett (politician)"}, "id": "480522", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bennett_(politician)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing News"}, "id": "579756", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_News"}, {"label": {"eng": "Horsehair"}, "id": "601753", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehair"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 88, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Sporting Goods", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Sporting_Goods"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "19:14:00"}

Which makes it a fitting site for the most craven carnival of the nation's sporting summer, the fight between American boxer Floyd Mayweather and Irish mixed martial arts (MMA) star Conor McGregor.\n\nOn Aug. 26, Mayweather, the recently unretired welterweight champion and one of the top pound-for-pound fighters of all time, will square off against McGregor, the biggest name in the ascendant UFC. What's at stake? Well, that's the rub.\n\nMayweather trains in Las Vegas on Aug. 10 for the fight with McGregor.\n\nUnlike most big-time pugilism spectacles, this fight is not a title bout. In fact, it will be McGregor's first professional boxing match. (MMA allows kicking and wrestling in addition to punching.) The smart money is on Mayweather. And no matter the outcome, each man will reportedly take home more than $100 million for a night's work.\n\nThe pairing is a sign of how far the sweet science has fallen in American culture. Mayweather, 40, hasn't fought in almost two years, yet he remains the sport's biggest U.S. draw. The brasher UFC has happily taken boxing's place in the firmament; the number of annual events it stages has doubled this decade. When the UFC made its long-awaited debut in New York City last November, tens of thousands of Irish-flag-waving fans filled Madison Square Garden to watch McGregor win the lightweight crown.\n\nMcGregor, prepping for his fight against Mayweather, receives a post-workout massage on Aug. 11.\n\nMcGregor takes a break with his infant son.\n\nMcGregor on a nighttime shopping outing at a mall in Las Vegas.\n\nConsider this showdown boxing's desperate bid for eyes and wallets -- both of which it seems to be winning. The fight is poised to break a pay-per-view record (it costs $95.95 to watch in HD), and the casinos are taking in millions in bets.\n\nIn the absence of consequence, venom has filled the vacuum. The fight was announced in mid-June -- the Super Bowl matchup, by comparison, is set two weeks before kickoff -- and the time since has been a parade of odious self-promotion. Among the lowlights of the three-country press tour: homophobic slurs (Mayweather, though he apologized), racist taunts (McGregor, though he denied the \u00adintent), misogyny (both) and a \u00adcustom-made suit emblazoned with F-CK YOU (McGregor, presenting himself to Mayweather). Muhammad Ali's lyrical wit, this was not.\n\nMcGregor and Mayweather at workouts for the media in Las Vegas.\n\nEven before this production, Mayweather had turned off many fans because of his history of violence against women. In 2010 his son, then 10, wrote in a statement to police that \"my dad was hitting my mom.\" Mayweather was sentenced to 90 days in jail after he pleaded guilty to a reduced battery domestic violence charge and no contest to two harassment charges.\n\nMcGregor, 29, has the backstory to play the hero. Raised in a blue collar Dublin suburb, he resisted the tempta\u00adtion to join a gang or deal drugs. Days before his first UFC fight, in 2013, he collected a $235 welfare check; he needed it after giving up a job as a plumber's apprentice. He skyrocketed to the top of the UFC, earning millions of dollars and global adoration along the way. Yet McGregor can't resist the low road; in July he wore the jersey of an NBA player who was allegedly involved with Mayweather's ex.\n\nDespite the unsavory buildup, the bout is likely to be the biggest fight on U.S. soil since Mayweather vanquished Manny Pacquiao in 2015. As the two fighters have settled into their desert training camps, the crowds have thronged along with the publicity machine. \"We figured out a way to take this to another level,\" said Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe. \"It's called entertainment ... People are intrigued about the Kardashians!\"\n\nNo fight could live up to these expectations. But many will be watching, just in case.", "id": "9740054", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The Spectacle in Sin City", "image":

With 8-ounce gloves, \"Mystic Mac\" revised that prediction to just two rounds. Now, McGregor is going even further.\n\nWhen asked Wednesday night on \"Conan\" about his prognostication for the Mayweather boxing match Aug. 26 in Las Vegas, McGregor laughed.\n\n\"I said four, but that's me being humble,\" the UFC lightweight champion told Conan O'Brien. \"I don't believe he will even exit the first round, but I'm trying to be humble on national TV. So I say four -- inside four.\"\n\nThose words are sure to draw the boxing world's ire more than ever. Mayweather has never lost. He's 49-0, one of the best of all time and has rarely been challenged. There are few instances of Mayweather even being wobbled in fights, let alone knocked out. Meanwhile, McGregor has never boxed professionally.\n\nMayweather, 40, is also known as perhaps the best defensive boxer in history. McGregor believes he has a strategy to crack that steel-curtain defense.\n\n\"I think the styles of opponents that Floyd has faced have moved in a certain way,\" McGregor said. \"The boxing game is almost set in its way, I feel. Their feet are flat. They have no spring in and out. Compare that with a mixed martial artist, they can bounce in and out at a fast tempo. So I believe I will paint pictures in there that he has never seen or the boxing community has never seen before and that will cause him big trouble.\n\n\"Factor that in with the precision and the punching power -- it only takes me one shot. I've KO'd men inside three seconds. I won the UFC title in 13 seconds. So, factor in all those things -- with the punching power and the precision -- it's over for Floyd and that's it.\"\n\nMcGregor, and even Mayweather's team in the promotion, has made plenty of Mayweather's age. McGregor is 29, 11 years Mayweather's junior. Mayweather hasn't fought since 2015, but he didn't seem any worse of wear in both his fights that year and appears to be in excellent shape.\n\nO'Brien asked McGregor if he might let down for a moment and come loose with a kick or something he'd be able to do in MMA but not boxing. McGregor said he would not and has brought in veteran boxing referee Joe Cortez for his sparring sessions to get him schooled on the rules.\n\n\"I will go in and dismantle him at his own game,\" McGregor said. \"That's what a true martial artist can do, they can adapt under any circumstance. Bruce Lee said, 'be like water,' and when the water enters a cup, it becomes the cup. That's the philosophy I'm going into this contest. It doesn't matter what ruleset or stipulations they try and put on me, I can adapt and overcome any situation.

Mayweather did get a controversial knockout over Victor Ortiz in 2011 and stopped Ricky Hatton in 2007.

Mayweather, who's black, hasn't made racist remarks during the over-the-top promotion of their pay-per-view extravaganza, but the boxing legend was heavily criticized for uttering a homophobic slur during the fourth and final stop on their four-city, three-country press tour last month in London.\n\nThe UFC superstar referred Wednesday to Mayweather condemning McGregor, who's white, for asking during a \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" interview in Toronto if Rocky III was the movie \"with the dancing monkeys in the gym.\" Mayweather also criticized McGregor for what he considered disrespectful comments toward black people the following day during their tour stop at Brooklyn's Barclays Center.\n\nIreland's McGregor admitted Wednesday that there are factions of his fan base and Mayweather's fan base that have made race a central theme, but he denounced that type of behavior. He has called claims that he is a racist \"f***ing ridiculous\" and again stated Wednesday that he doesn't consider his fight against Mayweather a contest centered around race.\n\n\"For me, this is athlete versus athlete,\" McGregor said. \"I was upset that Floyd tried to bring this in. I thought that was a weak move on his part, when he knows and his people truly know that it's not from me. I'm not saying that there's not people on both sides that have this mindset, where it's black versus white and this type of thing. But it's certainly something I do not condone.\n\n\"This is athlete versus athlete, two prime physically conditioned athletes about to take part in an amazing event. And that's it on my end. So I'm disappointed to hear sometimes the way it's been portrayed. But I suppose it's just the nature of the game with the way things are going on in the world at the moment. But all I can do is stay focused on my craft and look to go out and put on a great performance for the fans who are supporting this event as a whole.\"\n\nMayweather made his feelings clear about McGregor's behavior during an interview last week with ESPN's Stephen A. Smith.\n\n\"I just didn't like when he called us monkeys,\" Mayweather said. \"I think that was [total] disrespect. ... He called us monkeys. I didn't like it. It didn't push a button to make me jump out of my character and go crazy, but I didn't like it.\"\n\nThe undefeated five-division champion also told Smith, \"this is for a cause. This is for the American people. This is for all the blacks around the world.\"\n\nLas Vegas' Mayweather (49-0, 26 KOs) is 40 years old and hasn't fought in nearly two years, yet remains roughly a 5-1 favorite over McGregor. The 29-year-old McGregor is a two-division champion in UFC, but the mixed martial artist will participate in his first professional boxing match when he challenges Mayweather a week from Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

We talked with top women boxers and MMA fighters to get their perspective on the challenges that await both McGregor and Mayweather when they step into the ring on Aug. 26.\n\nespnW: What are your thoughts on the fight?\n\nClaressa Shields: You know, I've always been a Floyd Mayweather fan. And I still am. However, this [upcoming] fight has made me a fan of McGregor as well. I don't know how he got into boxing. He should totally be a comedian. McGregor is just so ruthless and reckless. It's something that we've never seen before. Has there been this much trash-talking in boxing, ever?\n\nespnW: Who you got?\n\nCS: I'm going with Mayweather all the way. The only chance McGregor has is if he lands a lucky punch in the first two rounds, which might make Mayweather change up his whole game plan. But, other than that. I just don't think McGregor has a chance.\n\nespnW: What will McGregor bring to the table that Mayweather won't be prepared for?\n\nMichelle Waterson: I feel like a lot of MMA fighters have really creative footwork that is not as traditional as boxing footwork, so that might be something different that Mayweather has never really dealt with. It's such a different movement, a different style, a different pace. It's kind of like when you have a dance partner who's on a different rhythm than you are. It throws you off of your rhythm.\n\nespnW: Who you got?\n\nMW: I would love for McGregor to win. It would turn the world upside down if he did. But you know, it is Mayweather's world in the boxing ring. I wouldn't put it past McGregor to win though. On any given day, anyone can get rocked.\n\nespnW: What is the biggest challenge in jumping from MMA to boxing?\n\nHeather Hardy: You're used to fighting a certain way and using things in your toolbox when you get into trouble, but [McGregor] is having many of his taken away. He can't kick, he can't take it to the ground -- all those things go out the window. And you're competing at the highest boxing level possible. It's impossible. It would be like [if I had made] my MMA debut against Amanda Nunes and expected to beat her. That's a little silly.\n\nespnW: How might Mayweather be surprised in facing such an accomplished mixed martial artist?\n\nHH: This is a guy who gets kicked in the face all the time, and gets punched with little four-ounce gloves. You go from getting hit by those gloves to big, padded boxing gloves and it's like a joke. If Floyd gets a stoppage or a knockout it will be because of unanswered punches or frustration. He's not going to put this guy on the canvas.\n\nespnW: What is the biggest challenge McGregor faces in transitioning from the Octagon to the boxing ring?\n\nJoanna Jedrzejczyk: It's not easy to make the transition from MMA to boxing. Boxing is a part of boxing, but we don't do this 24 hours a day. If there is someone who can do this, it is Conor McGregor.\n\nespnW: Why do you think McGregor is suited for this?\n\nJJ: He's one of the greatest in MMA. People can say whatever they want, but he's beaten the best fighters in his division. He has done so much for MMA. He's the man who can do this.\n\nespnW: Who you got?\n\nJJ: Conor McGregor will win this fight, and I think he will do it in the fourth round.", "id": "9740045", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Female fighters weigh-in: What challenges await Mayweather and McGregor?", "image": "http://a4.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0714/r231083_800x450_16-9.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 549, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 556}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "id": "303298", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trash-talk"}, "id": "325883", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash-talk"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}, "id": "327676", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amanda Nunes"}, "id": "343735", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Nunes"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Claressa Shields"}, "id": "355439", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claressa_Shields"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing glove"}, "id": "419805", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "UFC Lightweight Championship"}, "id": "615404", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions#Lightweight_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michelle Waterson"}, "id": "760730", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Waterson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joanna J\u0119drzejczyk"}, "id": "1274461", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_J\u0119drzejczyk"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 255, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1177, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "13:34:00"}

Byrd officiated in Mayweather's 2013 win over Robert Guerrero in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I truly believe the referee is going to do a great job,\" Mayweather said.\n\n\"The referee's job is to keep the fight clean. He don't have anything to worry about. I'm looking forward to following the Queensberry rules of boxing,\" he added.\n\nMayweather retired from boxing in 2015 with a perfect 49-0 record to emulate former heavyweight legend Rocky Marciano. A win against McGregor would see the welterweight become the only man to ever hold a perfect 50-0 record.\n\nMayweather insisted however that moving clear of Marciano's historic benchmark was not on his mind.\n\n\"Even though this is my 50th fight, this is not my focus,\" Mayweather said. \"Rocky Marciano is a legend, he did it his way. I just like to do it the Mayweather way.\"\n\nWin or lose, Mayweather is adamant that nothing will be able to tempt him back into the ring following his return against McGregor. He reiterated an earlier statement that this month's fight will be his last.\n\n\"This is my last one. I gave my word to (adviser) Al Haymon, I gave my word to my children, I don't want to break that,\" Mayweather said.\n\n\"I'm going to stick to my word -- this is going to be my last fight.\"\n\nShares", "id": "9833405", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Mayweather unfazed by 'dirty' McGregor - Capital Sports", "image": "http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/files/2017/08/38483ef7677400bf319ee956ba78a49a143b6c29.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 84, "date": "2017-08-10", "amb": false, "textEnd": 99}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 184, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 190}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 335, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 344}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}, "id": "307556", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}, "id": "315824", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Guerrero"}, "id": "323972", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Guerrero"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Marquess of Queensberry Rules"}, "id": "350071", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquess_of_Queensberry_Rules"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Cortez"}, "id": "498372", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cortez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rocky Marciano"}, "id": "521934", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Marciano"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rabbit punch"}, "id": "700581", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_punch"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1344, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Rabbits", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Rabbits"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "06:18:00"}

LET'S FIGHT IN 8 OZ GLOVES\" written on it in large white lettering.\n\nThe caption underneath read:\n\nDon't believe what you hear in the media. Don't believe what you hear on blog sites. If it's not coming directly from me, then it's not true.\n\nI'm telling McGregor, \"Let's fight in 8 oz gloves\".\n\nMcGregor can fight in any brand he prefers or chooses. I'll be wearing 8 oz Grant gloves.\n\nWhatever advantage McGregor needs to feel more comfortable in the ring, I'm willing to accommodate. Let's give the boxing and MMA fans what they want to see.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, Mayweather wanted to scrap the original plan to wear 10oz gloves so that both men can wear lighter 8oz gloves, instead.\n\nWhy is that unusual?\n\nIt's unusual because it was widely assumed that the fight was taking place at the super-middleweight limit -- slightly heavier than Mayweather's ideal weight -- precisely because he wanted to fight in the larger 10 oz gloves.\n\nMcGregor is the bigger and stronger man (Getty)\n\nBut keen boxing fans will have been most surprised by the third paragraph of the short statement: \"McGregor can fight in any brand he prefers or chooses. I'll be wearing 8 oz Grant gloves.\"\n\nAssuming the statement is not all an elaborate ruse, that admission represents a remarkable change of approach from Mayweather, who is known for being one of the best prepared (some might even say neurotic) boxers in the business.\n\nThe build-up to the Manny Pacquiao fight, for example, was dominated by arguments over what type of gloves would be used, with Mayweather's representatives controversially contesting the use of Pacquiao's preferred Reyes-manufactured boxing gloves shortly after the weigh-in.\n\nWhat has McGregor said on the topic?\n\nThe Irishman has repeatedly criticised his opponent for his many stipulations on what gloves will be used. In Los Angeles, on the first leg of their promotional tour, he said:\n\nMayweather vs McGregor: From trash-talk to super-fight 18 show all Mayweather vs McGregor: From trash-talk to super-fight 1/18 From trash-talk to super-fight\n\nJust how did an appearance on late-night show Conan and a rumbling Twitter feud turn into the biggest fight the sport of boxing has ever known.\n\nHere, we tell the story of how the trash-talk turned into a super-fight.\n\nGetty Images\n\n2/18 McGregor appears on Conan\n\n\"If you're asking would I like to fight Floyd Mayweather, I mean, who would not like to dance around the ring for $180m?\" McGregor replied to a playful question from late-night host Conan O'Brien, in July 2015, on whether he would ever be tempted into switching sports.\n\n\"I would certainly box him if the opportunity arose,\" he smiled.\n\n\"Most certainly.\"\n\n3/18 Mayweather's observation\n\nMayweather then rekindled the speculation, that December. In an interview with FightHype on the worldwide adulation McGregor had received for knocking out Aldo in just 13 seconds, the American complained that he would never receive such acclaim from the public because of the colour of his skin.\n\n\"They say he talk a lot of trash and people praise him for it, but when I did it, they say I'm cocky and arrogant,\" Mayweather observed.\n\n\"So biased! Like I said before, all I'm saying is this, I ain't racist at all, but I'm telling you racism still exists.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\n4/18 \"I am an Irishman\"\n\nThis time, it didn't take the other man the best part of half a year to respond. \"Don't ever bring my race into my success again,\" McGregor commented in a long Instagram post, the very next day.\n\n\"I am an Irishman. My people have been oppressed our entire existence. And still very much are. I understand the feeling of prejudice. It is a feeling that is deep in my blood ... If you want we can organise a fight no problem. I will give you a fair 80/20 split purse in my favour seen as your last fight bombed at every area of revenue.\"\n\nA feud was born.\n\n5/18 McGregor 'retires'\n\nAs interest in a fight with Mayweather began to increase, McGregor threatened to retire not just from MMA, but from sport altogether.\n\nUFC president Dana White announced that the promotion has pulled McGregor from the main event at UFC 200, because of his refusal to participate in mandatory media duties. McGregor's response?\n\n\"I have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya's later.\"\n\n6/18 Scoop\n\nThings came to a boil in May 2016. British tabloid The Sun reported that the two men were \"on the verge\" of agreeing to a deal, with an unnamed source telling the paper that \"Floyd is obsessed with making Conor eat his words\".\n\nThe story attracted so much attention that Dana White, the president of the UFC, felt compelled to finally address the situation. He laughed off suggestions the super-fight would ever take place, instead pointing out that McGregor was contracted to the UFC, and would thus be in breach of contract should he attempt to organise a fight himself away from the confines of the Octagon.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\n7/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters\n\nWhite's comments appeared to spur both men into action. First McGregor tweeted a mocked up fight poster with the caption 'MMA vs Boxing'...\n\nGetty Images\n\n8/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters\n\n... before Mayweather responded with an effort of his own (it wasn't quite as good).\n\nMayweather insisted began to insist a fight was \"possible\". Then he told a journalist that he was a retired man and would only countenance returning to professional sport in order to fight McGregor. And then he pressed the nuclear button, offering the Irishman just $50m to fight him in what people were already describing as a billion-dollar bout.\n\nGetty Images\n\n9/18 Leonard Ellerbe puts his foot down\n\nHold the hype. Just as things were beginning to heat up, Mayweather's promotions head, Leonard Ellerbe, poured cold water on the prospective fight, insisting it was \"a calculated effort by McGregor to gain more fans\".\n\nGetty Images\n\n10/18 Mac gets personal\n\nIn an attempt to get discussions back on track, McGregor got personal.\n\n\"Call me CJ Watson!\" he tweet, with a cartoon of him standing triumphantly above a knocked out Mayweather.\n\nThe caption was explosive: Mayweather was sent to prison in 2010 for the assault of his then-girlfriend. He was reportedly angry about text messages she had received from NBA star CJ Watson.\n\nGetty Images\n\n11/18 White rebuffed\n\nAt this point in the saga the president of the UFC, Dana White, reenters the fray.\n\nHaving previously insisted that the fight was a non-starter, he suddenly proposed a deal: $25m for each fighter, with the complicated PPV splits to be patiently worked out at a later date.\n\n\"He's a f***ing comedian,\" Mayweather replied.\n\nGetty Images\n\n12/18 In February 2017...\n\n... McGregor arrived in Las Vegas, to much excitement.\n\nMayweather tweeted the following.\n\nGetty Images\n\n13/18 Conor's response\n\nMcGregor's response to Mayweather's short statement was brutal and to the point.\n\n\"I am in Las Vegas. Floyd has retired on my arrival,\" he observed.\n\n14/18 Conan's back!\n\nWithout Conan O'Brien the biggest fight in the history of boxing would still be a daydream.\n\nIn March he invited Dana White onto his show, who said the following.\n\n\"I do think it's gonna happen. I think it's going to be a tough deal because obviously [there are] a lot of egos involved in this deal and a lot of people, so that always makes it tougher.\n\n\"On the flip side, there's so much money involved. I just don't see how it doesn't happen.\"\n\n15/18 Conor and Conlan\n\nMcGrgor was in New York to support Belfast boxer Michael Conlan in his professional debut against Tim Ibarra in March.\n\nBut the spotlight quickly sought him out. He reminded everyone that an announcement was imminent by shouting furiously into the face of ESPN boxing reporter Dan Rafael: \"I AM BOXING!\"\n\nGetty Images\n\n16/18 Fine downgraded\n\nOn March 22, an outstanding fine McGregor had with the Nevada Athletic Commission was downgraded, paving the way for the Irishman to obtain his necessary boxing license.\n\nGetty Images\n\n17/18 McGregor confirms\n\nOn Wednesday 14 June, the fight was finally confirmed by both men.\n\n\"THE FIGHT IS ON,\" McGregor posted on Twitter, along with a mocking picture of himself side-by-side with Floyd Mayweather Snr.\n\n18/18 Mayweather confirms\n\n\"It's official!\" replied Mayweather on Instagram, along with a short promotional video confirming the involvement of Showtime.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAll these rules, all these restrictions, it doesn't faze me, it amuses me. The gloves. They have to be 10 oz. 154 lbs, he's never fought at 154, I think he's fought at 154 maybe once.\n\nHe wants the gloves up, no problem, give him the gloves up. I'll wear 10 oz. No Mexican made gloves, OK, no problem. No gloves made out of horse hair, no problem, I don't give a f***.\n\nWe're only wearing gloves in our game about five years. So I don't give a s*** about gloves or any of that. I'm just enjoying it. It's funny to me, all these rules. All I need is a gum shield, line me up to the ring and I'm good to go.\n\nLater on in that press conference, Mayweather retorted by shouting \"If you want 8 oz gloves, let's put 8 oz gloves on. If you want 4 oz gloves, let's put 4 oz gloves on.\"\n\nMcGregor's response?\n\n\"Give me 4 oz gloves then.\"\n\nWhy does the size of the gloves matter?\n\nThe size of the gloves matters a huge deal.\n\nThe Irishman has stopped the majority of his opponents (Getty)\n\nIn the sport of mixed martial arts, McGregor is known and respected as one of the greatest knockout artists in the game. His pull-back left-hand counter is regarded by many pundits as the greatest strike in the sport and he has finished the vast majority of his opponents by either KO or TKO.\n\nIn the UFC, the promotion McGregor fights for, fighters wear 4 oz gloves. So McGregor's punching power will naturally be less in the ring than it is in the Octagon.\n\nBut wearing 8 oz gloves would suit him far more than wearing 10 oz gloves, which are more than double the weight of the gloves he is accustomed to fighting in.\n\nWhat has the Nevada State Athletic Commission had to say?\n\nIt was initially reported that the Nevada State Athletic Commission had denied there was any possibility of the fight taking place at the junior-middleweight weight limit with both men wearing 8 oz gloves.\n\nWill the rule change be permitted? (Getty)\n\n\"These regulations are in place for the health and safety of the athletes, which is of the utmost importance to the commission,\" the Nevada commission executive director Bob Bennett told ESPN on Tuesday night. \"Our regulations already outline the appropriate glove size according to contracted weight of a fight.\"\n\nHowever, the Nevada State Athletic Commission rules clarify that it is possible the fight can take place with 8 oz gloves.\n\nAccording to the rules, \"athletes (boxers/kick boxers) weighing-in up to and including 135 pounds must wear 8 oz gloves in competition, while athletes weighing-in over 135 pounds (junior welterweight class and above) must wear 10 oz gloves in competition. However, athletes weighing-in over 135 but (no) more than 147 may wear 8 oz gloves in competition if both athletes agree to do so in writing on their bout agreement (contract).\"\n\nSo, the late rule change is possible should both men agree to the change in writing.\n\nAnd what happened on Wednesday?\n\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission president Anthony Marnell has said that he is in favour of Floyd Mayweather's fight with Conor McGregor taking place with both men wearing 8oz weight gloves.\n\nMore about: UFC Floyd Mayweather Conor McGregor Mayweather vs McGregor Nevada State Athletic

Normally it's more taking my time, being very cautious, but this time I'm going straight ahead,' said Mayweather.\n\nAs the fight approaches there has been frequent talk of the possibility of any illegal moves used by McGregor, breaching the regulations of boxing.\n\nShould this happen, Mayweather is more than certain that the Dubliner would face extreme and immediate action.\n\n'That's a fine, that's a huge fine,' said Mayweather.\n\n'I don't think he wants to lose probably 90 per cent of his money, or more. I don't even know what that's going to be but it's going to be a heavy fine.'\n\nThe American superstar then made things much more interesting by dismissing Kimmel's notion that the fight is similar to a rugby star trying to play in the Super Bowl, because McGregor - like Mayweather - is undefeated on his feet.\n\nMayweather then teased the audience by suggesting he could be open to talks with McGregor about facing him inside the octagon, but only once the August 26 showdown is out of the way.\n\n'No (it isn't like a rugby player in the Superbowl) because Conor McGregor is undefeated standing up. When he stands up and fights toe-to-toe he's undefeated like myself. He lost three times but the only time he lost was when he was on the ground in the octagon.\n\n'I look forward to putting him down.

When the UFC lightweight champion boxes the undefeated Floyd Mayweather in what will be one of the three biggest one-night financial hauls in sports history, he'll make more money in one night than he's made in his entire professional career.\n\n\"It's the biggest event ever in combat sports,\" UFC president Dana White said. \"[There is] crazy, record-breaking [expletive] going on already.\"\n\nThe fight is expected to surpass the pay-per-view record of 4.6 million sales set in 2015 when Mayweather fought Filipino superstar Manny Pacquiao, a fight that had first been discussed in late 2009.\n\nAt $100 per unit, the pay-per-view could generate more than $500 million in pay-per-view revenue. Ticket sales figure to top out just under $90 million, surpassing the record of $72.2 million set in 2015 by Mayweather-Pacquiao. The largest gate McGregor has been involved with was $17.7 million, set on Nov. 5 at UFC 205 in New York, when McGregor knocked out Eddie Alvarez to win the lightweight belt.\n\nMcGregor already owns six of the eight largest gates in mixed martial arts history, but the combined total of those five events (No. 1: UFC 205; No. 4: UFC 194; No. 5: UFC 196; No. 6: UFC 202; and No. 7: UFC 189) is $50.9 million.\n\nInternational broadcast rights could reach as much as $100 million, though that may be a bit optimistic. Sponsorships for the fight - which, bizarrely, have yet to be announced and thus hasn't allowed the kind of branding seen on other major sporting events - could hit $20 million.\n\nIt all combined to mean that Mayweather and McGregor are going to make a lot of money, in excess of $100 million each. McGregor's manager, Audie Attar, said $100 million \"is a good number\" to use when trying to estimate McGregor's final purse.\n\nLike Mayweather, McGregor will earn from every dollar spent on the fight. A portion of every ticket or pay-per-view purchased, every hot dog consumed or beer drunk, every T-shirt sold, will wind up in the pockets of the two fighters.\n\nMcGregor said he is \"winning the promotion\" of the event and that it will all lead to significant money down the line.\n\n\"Who's winning the promotion? If it ain't me, what's going on?\" McGregor said. \"If it ain't for me scheduling full-on fights in the gym for you all to talk about and debate or my skill set or my approach, it's just Floyd at a roller disco. Or it's just Floyd at the Gucci store. You know what I mean? I'm the one bringing this all the way home. I'm the one on that world tour who went viral. I went viral multiple times on that world tour: The [expletive]-you suit, the mink coat, the money ... even he tried to throw the money and I went viral because it was like it was raining money above me. It's been all me.\n\n\"And I will collect every single dollar of this. I am in on everything: The food and beverage, the gate, the pay-per-view, the whole lot. When this fight is done, I will sit back and I will collect my show money and then I'll go start counting everything else.\"\n\nMayweather collected a guarantee of $100 million after the Pacquiao fight. When the news conference after that fight ended, Mayweather yelled to me to approach him. He then opened an envelope to show a $100 million check drawn on a Bank of America account. He expects to collect a larger guarantee for this fight.\n\nNeither Mayweather nor McGregor's guarantee is publicly known. Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions, said the figure won't be revealed until Aug. 25 at the weigh-in. Attar told Yahoo Sports that he could not reveal the guarantee but said it would be \"extraordinary.\" A source said McGregor's guarantee would be in the $50 million range.\n\nRead More\n\nUnderstanding how much the fighters will walk away with when the accounting is finished is difficult for several reasons, including that much of their income is on the come. The more tickets that are sold, the more the fighters will make; the more pay-per-view buys that are purchased, the better their bottom line will be.\n\nThere are three deals that are key to understanding in order to accurately determine the amount the fighters could make, and none of them are public knowledge.\n\nThe first is how the overall revenue will be split by Mayweather, his company Mayweather Promotions and his adviser, Al Haymon, on one side and McGregor and the UFC on the other.\n\nA source told Yahoo Sports that a 60-40 split on the revenue made after expenses in Mayweather's favor \"is a good guess,\" but there is no way to know that precisely without seeing the contract.\n\nThe second deal is the terms the UFC and McGregor made on how to split their share of the net revenues. McGregor's UFC contract forbids him from doing other sports, but he negotiated a deal with the UFC to allow him to box Mayweather.\n\nAll sides in the deal - Mayweather, McGregor, Haymon and the UFC - stand to make upside from the fight, meaning income from the pay-per-view sales.\n\nThe third deal is the one negotiated between the promotion itself and the cable and satellite distributors. In a normal boxing model, out of every $100 generated from pay-per-view, $50 would go to the cable and satellite companies and $50 to the promotion.\n\nThen, out of the promotion's $50, it would have to pay another $7.50 to the television network producing the pay-per-view, usually Showtime, as in this case, or HBO. That means that in a normal situation, the promotion would net $42.50 out of every $100 in PPV sales. Out of that $42.50, on a 60-40 split, the Mayweather side would get $25.50 for every $100 sold and the McGregor side would get $17.\n\nGiven the significance of the event, there is a chance that better terms were negotiated with the cable and satellite companies and with Showtime, though that is not known.\n\nBut under the standard terms, five million pay-per-view sales would result in $500 million gross revenue. The Mayweather side would under the formula above net $127.5 million, while the McGregor side would get $85 million.\n\nBut there will be several hundred million more in additional revenues for them to divvy up, after expenses. If we assume that the fight does $100 million from international broadcast rights, $20 million from sponsors, $85 million from the paid gate and $5 million from merchandising, that's another $210 million. The only other major revenue source would be concessions on fight night.\n\nIf the fight attracts 20,000 fans to T-Mobile and each fan spends an average of $50 on the night of the fight, that accounts for another $1 million.\n\nIf we take off $25 million for expenses, that would cut that figure to $186 million. The Mayweather side's 60 percent of that would be $111.6 million, while the McGregor side's 40 percent comes out to be $74.4 million.\n\nFor the Mayweather side, adding the $127.5 million in U.S. pay-per-view money to the $111.6 million from other sources, and his side is divvying up $239.1 million. McGregor's side would add the $85 million in pay-per-view to the $74.4 million in other revenues, meaning it would make $159.4 million.\n\nThat accounts to $398.5 million in profit for the two sides.\n\nThose numbers, of course, can fluctuate depending upon the deals that were struck between the sides as well as how well the fight performs.\n\nOne boxing person familiar with the mechanics of a pay-per-view show told Yahoo Sports he expects a massive sale PPV buy but isn't, for example, as certain that the paid gate will be as high as projected.\n\nTickets are priced as high as $10,000.\n\n\"The people you are talking about who would get a $10,000 ticket to this thing, most of them are going to be on a yacht in the south of France on fight night,\" he said.\n\nTalk, though, that ticket sales were slow irritated Ellerbe. He noted that a Sept. 16 pay-per-view bout between Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin would, at best, have less than a third of the total ticket revenue for Mayweather-McGregor.\n\nHe alleged that promoter Oscar De La Hoya of Golden Boy Promotions pulled back thousands of tickets in order to announce that Alvarez-Golovkin had sold out before Mayweather-McGregor when, he insisted, that isn't true.\n\n\"I'm actual tired of hearing that question [about ticket sales] because right now, we have over $60 million in the box office,\" Ellerbe said last week at Mayweather's media day workout in Las Vegas. \"You tell me what part of that makes you think ticket sales are slow. This isn't a damn Rolling Stones concert. That's the only thing that sells out in seconds. And when you're talking about tickets going for $5,000 or $10,000, that's an expensive ticket. You have every CEO from every major company, but it takes time for them to plan and get it together. The fact of the matter is, we have $60 million, over $60 million, in the box office right now.\n\n\"That is more than double any other live gate [for a combat sports event] that has ever been done [except for Mayweather-Pacquiao]. The fight they have on Sept. 16, we've got more in the box office now, more than double what they'll have in total.\"\n\nIt seems safe to say both fighters will walk away with more than $100 million, and if the fight does even better than expected, the numbers could zoom up exponentially.\n\n\"Nobody is going to be standing down on the street corner looking for a hand-out,\" Ellerbe said.\n\nIt's almost certainly going to be Mayweather's last fight, but Attar said McGregor will fight on. And though it's a fair question to ask how the UFC will be able to pay him in the future after he walks away from his bout with Mayweather with more than $100 million, Attar doesn't see a problem.\n\nHe said everyone has concentrated on making the Mayweather-McGregor bout a success and they aren't necessarily focused on what is next.\n\n\"I don't have that answer because we haven't given it much thought as of this point, but I have faith that we'll figure it out,\" he said. \"The UFC's position in the past was that this fight wouldn't ever happen. I think Dana said once that he'd be the starting quarterback for the Patriots before a fight with Mayweather ever happened, but here we are, less than two weeks away from the fight. It's happening and I believe that like he said, Conor will fight again after this.\n\n\"Dana is a smart person, the other people at the UFC are smart and when the time is right, we'll all get together and sit down and chat about it and put our brains together and figure out the best way forward.

UFC's president is certain that the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Conor McGregor fight will shatter combat sports' record for pay-per-view buys - roughly 4.6 million purchases of the disappointing Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight in 2015.\n\n\"The numbers are tracking huge,\" White said as part of a conference call that first featured McGregor. \"We're gonna do the numbers that everybody's been talking that we're gonna do. The line in Vegas is - the over/under is 4.9 million [pay-per-view buys]. Everything is tracking right now to say that we're gonna kill this thing. It's looking really good.\"\n\nThat's obviously an impressive statement when you consider no boxing match other than Mayweather-Pacquiao has exceeded the approximate 2.4 million buys produced by the Mayweather-Oscar De La Hoya fight in May 2007. McGregor's rematch against Nate Diaz in August 2016 is believed to be the most-watched pay-per-view event in UFC history (roughly 1.65 million buys).\n\nBased on the intense interest in Mayweather-McGregor - even among curious consumers who are certain it's a much greater mismatch than the ever-shrinking odds on the 12-round, 154-pound suggest - White cannot envision a scenario in which McGregor's crossover from mixed martial arts to boxing doesn't help smash every revenue record associated with combat sports.\n\nLike Mayweather-Pacquiao, it'll cost $99.95 to watch Mayweather-McGregor in HD on pay-per-view. The face value for tickets to the August 26 card at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas ranges in price from $500 to $10,000.\n\n\"There's tons of big fights that I've been involved with, but obviously nothing as big as this,\" White said. \"This is the biggest event ever in combat sports history. It is the most distributed event in pay-per-view history. You can get this fight anywhere. This thing is in like over 200 countries on pay-per-view. And, you know, boxing doesn't usually do a lot of digital [pay-per-view business], and you can buy this thing through ufc.tv, and, you know, through the Showtime app, Sony, Apple, etcetera, you can buy the thing. If you're in Manhattan or you're on a desert island somewhere, if you have Wi-Fi, you can buy this fight.\"\n\nWhite considers UFC fights involving McGregor and Ronda Rousey, Chuck Liddell-Tito Ortiz and Anderson Silva-Vitor Belfort among the biggest in which he has been involved. None of those fights in UFC's comparatively brief history can compare with Mayweather-McGregor, particularly among casual sports fans who haven't been able to avoid the fight on television, on social media and elsewhere on the Internet, on sports talk radio and in newspapers.\n\n\"[I've been involved in] tons of big fights that had a big-fight feeling, but this is the biggest fight ever,\" White said. \"It's tracking right now to be the largest commercial pay-per-view in the history of pay-per-view. It's the most distributed pay-per-view event in history. The list goes on and on of records that this thing will break.\"\n\nSeveral thousand extremely expensive tickets to Mayweather-McGregor reportedly remain available through TicketMaster and on the secondary market. The fight still is expected to shatter combat sports' record for ticket revenue (nearly $72.2 million for Mayweather-Pacquiao).\n\nWhite isn't simply surprised by how immense this event has become. He's still stunned they were even able to put it together, something he considered an impossibility when Ireland's McGregor mentioned it to him for the first time last year.\n\n\"I think the first time I remember the Mayweather thing was those guys were going back and forth,\" White recalled Wednesday. \"I was like, 'This is crazy that Conor and Mayweather are talking smack to each other right now.' Then Conor told me he wanted to fight him and I was like, 'What?! Why? What's the point of even talking about this? That guy's never gonna fight in MMA.' And he's like, 'No, I wanna box him.' And I was just like, 'All right, well, that's crazy.' And again, it's one of those things that I thought would never happen. Forget about the whole, 'What would the rules be?,' all that other [stuff]. I was like, 'We'd never get a deal done with these guys. It would be impossible to get a deal done.'\n\n\"Then the first time this thing even started to get serious was I was on ESPN and I threw out, 'I'll tell you what, Floyd, I'll give you $25 million.' And then TMZ got him somewhere and he hung his watch out the window and said, 'You see this watch?' And I don't know what that meant. The watch was $25 million? I don't know. But that's what started the negotiations, when I put out the $25 million offer.\"\n\nIf Mayweather-McGregor generates the type of profits White expects, the 29-year-old McGregor could join the 40-year-old Mayweather in earning nine figures from this fight. Mayweather made nearly $300 million from the Pacquiao fight, but this is foreign territory for McGregor, who hasn't forgotten that it was just five years ago that he competed before about 500 people in an MMA match in London.\n\n\"Well, it depends on obviously what the fight does,\" White said regarding McGregor's final take from the fight. \"But Conor's gonna make a lot of life-changing money, money that'll change his family's life forever.\"\n\nWhite continues to predict that McGregor will pull off a huge upset and knock out Mayweather (49-0, 26 KOs), who hasn't fought since he easily out-boxed Andre Berto in September 2015. Whatever happens in the ring a week from Saturday night, White is certain this spectacle has been a positive endeavor for both boxing and mixed martial arts.\n\n\"I believe that this is good for combat sports,\" White said. \"It's like when Mayweather-Pacquiao did the numbers that they did, I was like, 'Wow!' First, I said, 'Good for them.' I was like, 'That sets the bar. That shows me that if you have the right fight, at the right place, at the right time, you know, people are willing to watch.'\n\n\"I knew once this thing started to materialize that this fight was gonna be so much bigger worldwide than any fight that had ever happened. Conor has a very big following in places like Brazil and places like Australia, obviously Europe, so I knew that worldwide that this would be the biggest. And I was right. This thing is the biggest event that has ever happened to combat sports. This fight will reach over a billion homes worldwide.\"\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nConor McGregor believes Wednesday's ruling of the Nevada State Athletic Commission to permit 8 oz. gloves for his Aug. 26 with Floyd Mayweather gives him a significant advantage.\n\nMcGregor typically competes in 4 oz. gloves in the Ultimate Fighting Championship but was initially faced with the prospect of fighting Mayweather in 10 oz. hand coverings. The NSAC stipulates that in most cases, fights taking place at 154 lbs. or above should use 10 oz. gloves.\n\nHowever, after a verbal challenge from McGregor, Mayweather revealed on social media last week that he was willing to accept 8 oz. equipment.\n\n\"I'm very happy with how (the commission) handled it,\" McGregor said. \"They took both fighters requests into consideration and I'm very happy with it. You've got pros and cons on both sides and both athletes asking for it. I am coming up in weight on the gloves. Look at what I fight with (normally).\"\n\nIt is widely assumed that lighter gloves may benefit the heavy punching McGregor, as opposed to the more defensively-minded and tactical style of Mayweather.\n\nUFC President Dana White agreed.\n\n\"Now we are fighting in 8 oz. gloves and it is going to be a fight,\" White said on a conference call. \"Anything can happen in a fight.\n\n\"I think it affects the contest. Conor hits like a truck. Smaller gloves favor him big time. It affects the fight big time.\"\n\nThe NSAC also revealed that Robert Byrd would referee the contest. Kenny Bayless, the official for many of Mayweather's recent bouts, was ruled out after previously voicing his criticism of the clash, which will see the 49-0 Mayweather taking on a man making his boxing debut in McGregor.\n\n\"They gave us options and we didn't necessary ask for any ref in particular,\" McGregor added. \"There was a ref or two who gave opinions and if that's the case it makes it hard.\n\n\"Robert Byrd is a phenomenal ref, he lets the fight take place and steps in when he should step in. He has some links to the MMA world as well, so that's good.\"\n\nMORE BOXING NEWS:\n\nRelated: Lighter gloves approved for Mayweather-McGregor fight\n\nMore: What's bothering Floyd Mayweather ahead of fight?\n\nGALLERY: BUILDUP TO MAYWEATHER-MCGREGOR FIGHT\n\nBuild-up to Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor boxing bout Fullscreen Conor McGregor hits a heavy bag during a media workout in preparation for his fight against Floyd Mayweather at UFC Performance Institute.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nFloyd Mayweather labelled Conor McGregor a \"dirty\" fighter on Thursday, and admitted he fears the Irish mixed martial arts star will use roughhouse tactics during their boxing match on Aug. 26.\n\nMayweather admitted he had seen clips of McGregor in training and insisted that many of his moves and tactics stretched the bounds of boxing's strict regulations.\n\n\"I see a lot of rabbit punches behind the head, grappling, wrestling, illegal shots,\" Mayweather said on a media conference call. \"But the ref will be fair on both sides, I want him to be even. I want us to have a good solid fight.\"\n\nMcGregor has stipulations in his contract that would impose a severe financial penalty if he was to employ the kind of moves he typically uses in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, such as kicks and elbows.\n\nHowever, \"dirty\" boxing moves do not fall under that category, and would need to be controlled by referee Robert Byrd in the ring. It should also be noted that Mayweather has been accused of using elbows himself, especially by former opponent Victor Ortiz.\n\nMayweather: The champ plans career move after McGregor fight\n\nBothered?: What's got Mayweather irked ahead of his fight with McGregor?\n\nMore: 8-ounce gloves approved for Mayweather-McGregor\n\nMcGregor hired retired official Joe Cortez to look over his sparring sessions in training, in order to ensure he remains within the rules.\n\n\"I truly believe (Byrd) is going to do his job, his job is to keep the bout clean,\" Mayweather added. \"We are going to have a hell of a fight. Like I have said, I am coming straight ahead.\n\n\"I look forward to following the Queensberry rules of boxing. (McGregor) had Joe Cortez in his training camp but I still see him being extremely dirty. But my job is not to referee the fight, I am going to do my job. I am not worried about the outcome, I am more worried about excitement.\"\n\nDespite teasing in various television interviews that he may be prepared to fight McGregor a second time, perhaps even in a mixed martial arts octagon, Mayweather was adamant on Thursday that this bout will be his last. His most recent contest was against Andre Berto in 2015, which ended in a unanimous points victory.\n\n\"I thought Berto was going to be last weigh-in, last training camp, my last everything,\" Mayweather added. \"But you just never know what can happen and we are here with this big event. This is my last one, ladies and gentlemen. I gave my word to (advisor) Al Haymon, my children, and I don't want to break that. I want to stick to my word. This will be my last fight.\"\n\nGALLERY: Build-up to Mayweather-McGregor\n\nBuild-up to Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor boxing bout Fullscreen Conor McGregor hits a heavy bag during a media workout in preparation for his fight against Floyd Mayweather at UFC Performance Institute.

I'm very happy with it,\" McGregor told reporters on a conference call.\n\nMayweather had nearly all of his 49 professional wins using eight-ounce gloves, which may accentuate one of his advantages - his hand speed.\n\nMcGregor preferred the lighter gloves since he is used to the fingerless, four-ounce gloves typically worn in MMA.\n\n\"That's it in a nutshell, you've got pros and cons on both sides,\" he said. \"Favours us both in certain ways.\n\n\"I believe now that the gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor added.\n\n\"Part of me ... kind of wants to show some skills and dismantle him that way. (But) I do not foresee him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nWhile most pundits have McGregor, who has never boxed professionally, as a heavy underdog, the Dubliner said he was determined to prove the doubters wrong.\n\n\"I'm just looking forward to Aug 26, going in and proving what I'm saying and educating the world on what martial arts is,\" he said. \"And earning my respect in this game also.\"\n\nThe Irishman said his gruelling preparations for the fight would enable him to triumph no matter how the fight develops.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I am not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\"McGregor added.\n\n\"The training sessions and the practice that we've been putting in has been through hell and back. We are ready for absolutely every scenario.\n\n\"I'm ready to go to war for the full 12 rounds and I am ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds. That's where my head's at.\"\n\nDana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), followed McGregor on the conference call and predicted the fight could even threaten the reported $600m haul from the Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao 2015 showdown.\n\n\"This is the biggest event ever in combat sports history. This is the most distributed event in pay-per-view history,\" White said, also citing the additional digital reach.\n\n\"This thing is in like 200 countries on pay-per-view.

But the NSAC recently revealed they were going to vote to reduce the glove size to eight ounces, something they officially confirmed today in addition to the judges and referee according to UFC.com:\n\n\"The final details of the Aug. 26 bout between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor were ironed out at the Nevada State Athletic Commission meeting in Las Vegas on Wednesday.\n\nAs expected, both fighters were licensed for the matchup at T-Mobile Arena, and following a request from each camp, the bout will now be contested using eight-ounce gloves, not the 10-ounce gloves usually used in 154-pound boxing matches.\n\nThe referee will be Robert Byrd and the three judges chosen for the match are Guido Cavalleri, Burt Clements and Dave Moretti.\"\n\nThe reduced glove size would expectedly favor McGregor, a fighter who is well known for his massive knockout power while wearing four-ounce gloves during his electric run to two UFC titles since his debut in 2013. Most who have given the Irishman merely a puncher's chance - if they've given him a chance at all - to stop undefeated all-time great Mayweather in the early rounds, so a switch to smaller gloves would certainly seem to favor \"The Notorious\" by making his punches hit harder and also tougher to block.\n\nHowever, it would also seem to boost Mayweather's speed, an area where most experts and fans are justifiably giving \"Money\" a decided advantage.

Even though McGregor's striking coach Owen Roddy thinks this is Floyd's hubris backfiring on him, the fact is that everyone, every single person breaking down this fight, knows that McGregor's best chance of winning comes in the first four rounds, and having lighter gloves will increase his chance at a knockout, even a little. It will mostly increase his speed. Last week, McGregor told ESPN the following: \"If we are in 8-ounce gloves, he will be floored multiple times in the first round. I believe first-round KO in 8-ounce gloves.\"\n\nBut for Mayweather, the impact of this change is kind of a wash. Mayweather is known for having brittle hands, and the smaller gloves could lead to a broken hand, which could, in turn, cost him his 50th win. Or, the smaller glove size will allow him to be that much faster until he eventually picks apart McGregor and finishes him in later rounds. Mayweather has fought most of his fights in 8oz gloves, so the change really isn't even that drastic for him. Mayweather's spokesman, Ray Ellerbe, said that they were giving McGregor every chance to be comfortable, so there wouldn't be any excuses.\n\nUltimately, this will probably make the action maybe five percent \"better.\" Or at the very least it makes the lead up to the fight that much more interesting after it was starting to get a little bit stale.\n\nBut for Mayweather to keep giving McGregor caveats as McGregor predicts knockouts is subtly vicious. If Floyd destroys the Mystic Mac persona, then what does he have but a return to the Octagon with his tail between his legs and a bank account a hundred million dollars fatter?", "id": "9597712", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Conor McGregor And Floyd Mayweather Are Fighting In Smaller 8oz Gloves", "image": "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/conor-mcgregor4.jpg?quality=100&w=650", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "id": "305867", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hubris"}, "id": "318888", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Strike (attack)"}, "id": "399728", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_(attack)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "17:22:00"}

In just the brief footage Mayweather watched from the UFC superstar's sparring sessions against Paulie Malignaggi, he noticed McGregor continuously breaking the rules.\n\nByrd is a veteran referee who has worked numerous high-profile fights. He is not known, however, for being physical about breaking up action once it gets rough.\n\nMayweather still expressed confidence during a conference call that Byrd will keep their 12-round, 154-pound fight, McGregor's boxing debut, as clean as possible.\n\n\"I truly believe the ref's gonna do his job,\" Mayweather said. \"The referee's job is to make sure the fighters are keeping the bout clean. And I want us to put on a hell of a fight. Like I said on numerous occasions building up to this fight, I'm coming straight ahead. So he don't have nothing to worry about. I look forward to following the Queensbury rules of boxing, and I'm pretty sure he looks forward to following the Queensbury rules of boxing.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old McGregor has had retired referee Joe Cortez officiating sparring sessions throughout training camp, so he could become accustomed to boxing's rules. Mayweather commended McGregor for taking that step, but he's not convinced it has made much of a difference.\n\n\"He had Joe Cortez in his training camp, which is a great thing,\" Mayweather said. \"Even though he had Joe Cortez in his training camp, I still seen him doing - being extremely dirty. But my job is not to worry about the referee. My job is to go out there and fight, and let the referee do his job.\"\n\nMayweather isn't particularly concerned with McGregor attempting anything resembling an MMA move during their bout because McGregor would face a huge financial penalty based on language in their contracts, as well as a lawsuit. But McGregor is expected to try to make their fight as rough and physical as possible because Mayweather has such superior boxing ability.\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

He avenged his first UFC loss by beating Nate Diaz nearly a year ago and became the organization's first simultaneous two-division champion in November.\n\n\"I'm scheduling opponents with belts and I'm telling them what I'm going to do to them, and how I'm going to do it, and then I'm doing it,\" McGregor said. \"The train just kind of rolls with it and picks up steam ...

And I'm going to shock it once again.\"\n\nYes, he's a 6-1 betting underdog in Nevada sports books and likely will be picked apart by the fast, elusive Mayweather, but why the consternation about a talented, charismatic champion wanting to pursue his ultimate challenge as a stand-up fighter, selling it in entertaining form throughout?\n\nIn UFC circles, McGregor's innovative verbal skills brought great skepticism about his ability to defeat Aldo, who was unbeaten for 10 years before absorbing a knockout punch that ended their December 2015 fight in a record 13 seconds.\n\n\"This one is supposedly the big one. Wait until you see how he falls and you all write him off after this ... he becomes like Aldo. Aldo was him at one stage,\" McGregor said. \"Just another day for me, something I'm used to seeing.\n\n\"I'm used to the way that people react to me coming into a fight. I don't know how many times they've labeled me a joke -- 'He's a joker. Look at the way he's moving, he hits ... he doesn't stand a chance.' And then the poor guy facing me has to deal with it and he's unconscious, and then on to the next. More questions. More belts. And this will just continue until I call it a day.\"\n\nLeonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions, has heard the ridicule toward Mayweather-McGregor from those in the know, and he even took one critic to task with cameras rolling at one of the four press tour stops that drew more than 10,000 fans in New York.\n\n\"That's the reason that our sport isn't where football, basketball [are] ... it's because we stay in our own little box,\" Ellerbe said. \"You tell me, what is wrong with these two guys fighting? If you don't want to watch it, don't buy it. Simple as that.\"\n\nOf course it seems absurd that Mayweather, at 40, will have aged so badly in his time away that he will be caught by heavy McGregor punches.\n\nThis fight is more about the spectacle of bringing these two personalities together in one ring, pitting boxing's best against UFC's best and seeing what happens.\n\nWill Mayweather finally feel emboldened enough against his 0-0 opponent to deliver an action fight to close his spectacular career at 50-0?\n\nWhat will the creative, power-punching McGregor do to provide the entertainment he's known for?\n\nPurists have umpteen other fights to systematically analyze and debate, including two immediately on the horizon: the super-flyweight tripleheader at StubHub Center on Sept. 9 and the Canelo Alvarez-Gennady Golovkin middleweight title fight Sept. 16.\n\n\"You can't be mad and be going out there like some media members and promoters, [saying] this is why you shouldn't buy the fight and this and that ... mind your own ... business, do your job, cover the sport,\" Ellerbe said. \"We know what this is about. One thing is for sure, you are not going to stop this event.\"\n\nThat's a critical point. Unlike the deserved public disdain pointed at the lackluster Mayweather-Pacquiao bout, after Ellerbe and Mayweather charged fans $100 for the pay-per-view, this is the ultimate buyer-beware event.\n\nYet, with Ellerbe and UFC President Dana White saying more than $60 million in tickets have been sold - the Mayweather-Pacquiao record gate was $72 million - the money is flowing in.\n\n\"We didn't ask for this. Social media was on fire because of these two guys going at it,\" Ellerbe said. \"The fans demanded this event and they're going to get it.\"\n\nlance.pugmire@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @latimespugmire",

However his former MMA sparring partner Richard Kiely feels that it won't make a big difference to the overall contest.\n\n\"If there was an impact you would feel it a bit more with the heavier gloves but in terms of the protection it offers Floyd-which is a big advantage- it won't really be a factor, Kiely told RT\u00c9 Sport.\n\n\"Floyd still had the advantage because he is wearing pillows to protect himself. If there is a solid connection you will feel it but they still cover a large area so to get that connection will be difficult.\n\n\"With the four-ounce gloves that are worn in MMA if you put the guard up you can still connect with punches.\n\n\"The four-ounce gloves literally cover the knuckles and then the padding is dispersed around the hand. It's different to the pillows they wear in boxing that cover a larger area.\"\n\nBefore turning to MMA where he is 2-0, Kiely was a national kick-boxing champion. He has experienced wearing both 10-ounce and MMA gloves.\n\n\"When I was adapting to wearing MMA gloves it was a huge difference because I was getting caught with shots that i wouldn't usually get caught with.\n\n\"With the bigger gloves you can almost rest and hide behind your guard if you trust your guard.\n\n\"It's like putting up a barrier, the shots that would connect in MMA won't connect in boxing. It covers such a larger surface area.\n\n\"In kick-boxing when I was wearing the 10-ounce gloves it was easier to hide, then when I started in MMA it was a shock to the system.\n\n\"I was getting caught with shots and it was purely down to the surface area covered.\"\n\nKiely is trained by John Kavanagh in Straight Blast Gym and beat Daniel Olejniczak in stunning knock-out victory in the second round in his last fight. The Tallaght-native has sparred regularly with McGregor and knows just what he is capable of.\n\n\"Conor is explosive, it's like he has horse shoes in his hand, he is dynamite with them. If he can break the guard with shots he will catch Floyd, that straight left he has would break Floyd's guard.\n\n\"I'd imagine Floyd is going to rely on his shoulder roll to avoid the shots because he knows the power that Conor has.\n\n\"It's not beyond the realms of possibility that over 12 rounds Conor will connect with him. And once is all he needs.\n\n\"I've gotten hit with that left hand, I'm a bigger man than Floyd and I felt it down to my boots so if he hits Floyd with that he will know about it.\n\nYou can run. But you can't hide. pic.twitter.com/XXIrv21xG7 -- Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA)\n\nAugust 7, 2017\n\n\"I envision the fight will be between four and six rounds. Floyd will get complacent between four and six or he will try and take a breather and Conor will catch him.\"\n\nOn Wednesday the Commission will also make a call on who will serve as referee and judges for the bout.\n\nThe showdown will take place on 26 August in Las Vegas and those in contention for officiating the fight are believed to be Russell Mora, Robert Byrd and Tony Weeks.\n\nVeteran boxing referee Kenny Bayless, who refereed five of Mayweather's last ten bouts including the win against Manny Pacquiao, will not be assigned to the fight.\n\nThe Nevada State Commission made the decision not to consider him in light of past critical comments Bayless made about the match-up. Last year he admitted that he didn't see the point of it as its two very different sports.\n\nOn Friday McGregor said that he didn't feel Bayless should be involved in the fight but Bob Bennett, executive director of the Nevada State Commission claimed that McGregor's views didn't affect the decision to not consider Bayless.", "id": "9415290", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Ruling due on gloves for McGregor versus Mayweather", "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/000e53fa-1600.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 308, "amb": false, "textEnd": 317, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}, {"textStart": 3308, "date": "2017-08-07", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3322}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Tallaght"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "112563", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallaght", "label": {"eng": "Tallaght"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kickboxing"}, "id": "330771", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9 Sport"}, "id": "385500", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9_Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}, {"label": {"eng": "Referee (boxing)"}, "id": "753414", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(boxing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "MMA gloves"}, "id": "975775", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMA_gloves"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kenny Bayless"}, "id": "1084220", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bayless"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 770, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "06:28:00"}

I don't think he wants to lose 90 per cent of his money, of even more. I don't really know what it's gonna be [the fine] but it's gonna be a heavy fine.\"\n\nJimmy then asked Mayweather if he had to sign an agreement that stops him from kicking McGregor square in the head, to which he said:\n\n\"I'm not gonna do that. I follow the Queen's rules of boxing.\"\n\nPressing on his five-division world champion guest, Jimmy asked him if, presuming he emerges victorious at the T-Mobile Arena, he would be open the idea of stepping into McGregor's world, in the form of an MMA bout.\n\n\" As of right now, we gotta get past August 26. Once we get past August 26, then we can talk about other things.\" he added.\n\nMayweather is of course the overwhelming favourite ahead of McGregor, who is swapping the octagon for the boxing ring for the first time in his professional career.\n\nAnd his lack of experience between the ropes, coupled his worryingly slow and laboured approach on the bag as seen in his open workout, has led to one anonymous tipster placing an absolute fortune on Mayweather picking up his 50th professional victory.\n\nAs reported by ESPN, on Friday night, a mammoth $880,000 bet, believed to be the largest in relation to the superfight so far, was placed at South Point Casino in Las Vegas. Should Mayweather come out on top whether it be through knockout or points, the punter will rake in $160,000 from the fight.\n\nHis bet was on a such a scale that the ticket system could not handle it. The ticket, as seen above, shows a $120,000 profit but that printing error came about because the system in place at South Point Casino does not allow payouts in excess of 1 million.\n\nTo get around the system, two separate $440,000 bets have been written for the uber confident bettor. If Mayweather emerges victorious and this bet therefore comes through, the total pay-out will stand at a whopping $1.04 million.\n\nImage: PA\n\nSpeaking last week, Betfair's Katie Baylis spoke about the crazy amounts they have seen splashed out ahead of the mega-bout, and predicted even money to come in.\n\n\"It's now three weeks until one of the most anticipated fights in recent memory and with \u00a311.3 million bet on the outcome alone already this is now the biggest boxing betting event in Betfair history.\n\n\"We expect this fight to trade well over \u00a350m and could even get to the \u00a3100m mark, which would be one of our biggest sporting events of all time.\n\n\"Floyd Mayweather Jr is the 1/5 favourite, with Conor McGregor at 5/1. As you would expect most of the money is for Mayweather Jr, however 40% of bets are on McGregor, compared to 34% on Mayweather Jr and 26% on the draw.\"\n\nMayweather-McGregor, who you got on August

If you put one camera on him, he's 10 per cent better. Put two cameras on him, and he's 20 per cent better. He's one of those fighters.\n\nThe more atmosphere in Vegas, the better Conor will be.\n\nHis mind moves so quickly. Every time Floyd said something during the press tour, then walked away, Conor shut him down straight away.\n\nConor's quick-thinking has brought him to the forefront of MMA. He's destroyed every opponent before they even step into the octagon.\n\nI like to look at fighters in the build-up - on the scales, in the face-off, directly before the fight. Plenty of times before a McGregor fight I've looked at his opponent and thought: 'they are already beaten'.\n\nThat's the aura that McGregor brings to the table, and I don't think anybody has brought that aura to a Mayweather fight before.\n\nThat will be unsettling to Mayweather. When opponents have fought him before, you walk out into a Mayweather production. But McGregor has taken over this production.

Commission rules require 10-ounce gloves for 154-pound fighters, and McGregor thinks the waiver allowing smaller gloves will amplify his punching power.\n\nWhere he first said he'd stop Mayweather in four rounds, he now makes a bolder prediction.\n\n\"Now that the gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said during Wednesday's media conference call. \"I'm ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds. That's where my head's at.\"\n\nOther peoples' minds are on the money.\n\nMayweather told late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday that he would likely gross $350 million from the bout.\n\nWhile high prices depressed ticket sales early, secondary seller StubHub reports robust recent business. The company says Mayweather-McGregor is the second-best selling fight on their platform, trailing only Mayweather's 2015 clash with Manny Pacquiao.\n\nStubHub communications manager Cameron Papp says it makes sense, given that four of the top five best-selling fights in the company's history involve either Mayweather or McGregor.\n\n\"The sales are going to go where the stars are,\" Papp said.\n\nUFC president Dana White says the event projects to shatter the record 4.6 million pay-per-view buys Mayweather-Pacquiao earned. And while boxing cards traditionally depend on TV viewers, White says the UFC's inclusion as a co-promoter helps Mayweather-McGregor reach younger viewers on digital platforms.\n\n\"This is the biggest event ever in combat sports history,\" White said. \"If you're in Manhattan or on a desert island somewhere, if you have wifi you can buy this fight.\"\n\nBut selling this fight also means peddling the idea that Mayweather, an undefeated tactical wizard of a boxer, won't badly outclass pro boxing debutant McGregor.\n\nWhite insists McGregor is more skilled in the ring than the boxing community realizes, and says there's precedent for stunning upsets in cross-genre fights.\n\nThe UFC president cited former heavyweight boxing champ Ray Mercer, who flattened faded UFC star Tim Sylvia in nine seconds when they met in a 2009 MMA bout.\n\nBut where Mercer used his boxing expertise to prevail in a fight that permitted fisticuffs, McGregor can't kick, elbow or choke Mayweather to gain an advantage.\n\nHe can only box, and questions still surround his ring proficiency.\n\nWhite released two video clips last week on social media -- one that he said showed McGregor scoring a knockdown over retired former boxing champ Paulie Malignaggi, and another featuring McGregor landing a thunderous left hand against the boxer.\n\nMalignaggi maintains those two clips, which total less than 30 seconds, are McGregor's best moments from a 12-round sparring session the boxer says he dominated. He has repeatedly invited the UFC to publish unedited footage of the whole session.\n\nReplays also reveal McGregor cuffed Malignaggi behind the neck and dragged him to the canvas rather than dropping him with a punch.\n\nWhen McGregor performed a series of unorthodox drills as part of his media workout, boxers mocked the movements and posted video to social media with the hashtag #McGregorChallenge.\n\nMcGregor acknowledges his skills look strange to people steeped in boxing technique.\n\nFor him, that's the point.\n\n\"They've got a closed mind,\" he said. \"You've got to have an open mind...

The UFC star now doubts that Mayweather will even make it out of the first round.\n\n\"I said four, but that's me being humble. I don't believe he will even exit the first round, but I'm trying to be humble on national TV. So I say four -- inside four,\" McGregor told host Conan O'Brien.\n\n\"I think the styles of opponents that Floyd has faced have moved in a certain way. The boxing game is almost set in its way, I feel. Their feet are flat. They have no spring in and out. Compare that with a mixed martial artist, they can bounce in and out at a fast tempo. So I believe I will paint pictures in there that he has never seen or the boxing community has never seen before and that will cause him big trouble.\n\n\"Factor that in with the precision and the punching power -- it only takes me one shot. I've KO'd men inside three seconds. I won the UFC title in 13 seconds. So, factor in all those things -- with the punching power and the precision -- it's over for Floyd and that's it.\"\n\nTags: Floyd Mayweather Jr. Conor McGregor Mayweather vs. McGregor", "id": "9631802", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "McGregor: I Don't Even Believe Mayweather Will Exit Round One!", "image": "http://photo.boxingscene.com/uploads/conor-mcgregor%20(22).jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 80, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 87}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foot (unit)"}, "id": "304171", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}, "id": "311156", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conan (TV series)"}, "id": "314497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_(TV_series)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tempo"}, "id": "320982", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punching power"}, "id": "420928", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punching_power"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conan O'Brien"}, "id": "478726", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_O'Brien"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 685, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "07:23:00"}

McGregor's fans aren't listening.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, 15 out of every 16 bettors at South Point casino's sports book is putting money at the UFC star winning on Aug. 26; British bookie William Hill's US operation said that it is going to have a record loss on a single event should McGregor win. The influx of money on McGregor has helped push the winnings on a Mayweather victory down -- you have to bet $700 on him to get $100 now, down from $750 a couple of weeks back. McGregor is still a 5-to-1 outsider, which is way down from the 11-to-1 where he opened. (A British company is giving new customers odds of 49 to 1.)\n\nBecause they think Mayweather is going to win easily, many boxing enthusiasts feel the sport is being demeaned by him even entering the ring with McGregor. The legendary boxer-turned-promoter, Oscar de la Hoya, said that \"boxing is starting to dig [itself] out of the hole that Floyd and Manny Pacquiao shoveled by waiting seven years to put on a fight that ended up being as dull as it was anti-climactic\" and \"only we can shut the circus down by making it clear that we won't pay to see a joke of a fight and telling our casual-fan friends that they shouldn't, either.\"\n\nActually, they should all grab a drink and tune in. Far from ruining it, this is the best opportunity that boxing has had in years to win people over.\n\nAs the betting shows, a lot of McGregor's fans think he can win. The upstart Ultimate Fighting Championship, which launched in 1993 and it is now the premier venue to watch the melange of fighting techniques known as mixed martial-arts, has its own foul-mouthed stars (of which McGregor is the foremost) and its rabid fanbase, so much so that it was recently bought for more than $4 billion.\n\nThose fans love the brutality of MMA. The knockouts. The blood. The submissions. They think that makes it a better, tougher sport. \"This is a limited set of rules, it makes this half a fight, a quarter of a fight,\" McGregor said of his Mayweather bout. He hasn't even hired a boxing coach for this fight. \"If this was a true fight, it wouldn't take a round,\" he added. But boxing isn't a street fight. This isn't in \"standup\" in the Octagon, where you also have to worry about kicks and takedowns. This is a 150-year-old Olympic-level sport where people train their whole lives to do two things: execute and dodge punches.\n\nIf the fight goes as expected -- Pacquiao says \"there is no way he will be able to land a meaningful punch on Floyd\" -- it will be an opportunity to show millions what boxing is all about.\n\nAfter 50 fights, this is also our last chance to watch Mayweather, one of the greatest boxers ever, in what will certainly be his final fight. The unappreciated 40-year-old often reminds fans that boxing is about \"hitting and not getting hit.\" Against an opponent 11 years younger in his prime, this fight might make people understand the incredible skill involved in doing what Mayweather does.\n\nAnd there are a lot of casuals who could be lured back in -- far more than there are hardcore UFC fans who are moving the betting odds. There have been six UFC events so far this year; none of sold more than 300,000 pay-per-views each. In total, they have had less than 1.5 million buys in the US in 2017. The Mayweather-Pacquiao fight alone had 4.4 million buys, a record.\n\nThe fight against McGregor should do many millions more. This fight is being set up as Boxing vs. MMA. Those fans betting on McGregor might be about to learn the difference between the \"sweet science\" and \"ground and pound.\"\n\nRead this next: Why Floyd Mayweather cares so much about the size of his boxing gloves\n\nRead full story", "id": "9685435", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The Mayweather-McGregor fight might just be the thing that will save boxing", "image": "https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/rtstt1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=800&h=400&crop=1", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 328, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 335}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}, "id": "302553", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Casino"}, "id": "304317", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}, "id": "311156", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bookmaker"}, "id": "325370", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}, "id": "344827", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Odds"}, "id": "354512", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oscar De La Hoya"}, "id": "421405", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_De_La_Hoya"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steeler Nation"}, "id": "483375", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeler_Nation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "1278946", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr._vs._Manny_Pacquiao"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 169, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 529, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 530, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "12:28:00"}

Mayweather and McGregor will fight at 154 lb.\n\nThe change could be viewed as a win for McGregor, who had noted to Mayweather that he fights with 4 oz. gloves in UFC. McGregor had previously said that a lighter glove will help him knock out Mayweather in the first round.\n\n\"If we're 8 ounces, I'm struggling to give him two rounds,\" McGregor told reporters.\n\n\"The only reason I'll maybe give him two rounds is because, in this game, the referee stops me from pounding his head into the canvas and he has 10 seconds to recover.

I'm very happy with it,\" McGregor told reporters on a conference call.\n\nMayweather had nearly all of his 49 professional wins using eight-ounce gloves, which may accentuate one of his advantages - his hand speed.\n\nMcGregor preferred the lighter gloves since he is used to the fingerless, four-ounce gloves typically worn in MMA.\n\n\"That's it in a nutshell, you've got pros and cons on both sides,\" he said. \"Favours us both in certain ways.\n\n\"I believe now that the gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor added.\n\n\"Part of me ... kind of wants to show some skills and dismantle him that way. (But) I do not foresee him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nWhile most pundits have McGregor, who has never boxed professionally, as a heavy underdog, the Dubliner said he was determined to prove the doubters wrong.\n\n\"I'm just looking forward to August 26, going in and proving what I'm saying and educating the world on what martial arts is,\" he said. \"And earning my respect in this game also.\"\n\nThe Irishman said his gruelling preparations for the fight would enable him to triumph no matter how the fight develops.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I am not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\" McGregor added.\n\n\"The training sessions and the practice that we've been putting in has been through hell and back. We are ready for absolutely every scenario.\n\n\"I'm ready to go to war for the full 12 rounds and I am ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds. That's where my head's at.\"\n\nDana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), followed McGregor on the conference call and predicted the fight could even threaten the reported $600 million haul from the Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao 2015 showdown.\n\n\"This is the biggest event ever in combat sports history. This is the most distributed event in pay-per-view history,\" White said, also citing the additional digital reach.\n\n\"This thing is in like 200 countries on pay-per-view.

The people asked for the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight and they're giving them what they asked for. From the media and promoters perspective, you can understand why they would be not pleased with seeing a mismatch between Mayweather and McGregor, because it's a fight that could hurt the boxing industry long term if it turns out like Mayweather's high priced fight against Manny Pacquiao in 2015.\n\n\"You can't be mad and be going out there like some media members and promoters, [saying] this is why you shouldn't buy the fight and this and that ... mind your own ... business, do your job, cover the sport,\" Ellerbe said to the latimes.com. \"We know what this is about. One thing is for sure, you are not going to stop this event.\"\n\nEllerbe is right about the media and promoters not being able to stop the Mayweather-McGregor event by downgrading it. It's the buyer beware. The casual boxing and MMA fans that will be buying the event likely are tuning out negative stuff and they won't be convinced not to buy. They'll have to see for themselves by buying it and learning a lesson the painful way if it turns out to be just as Mayweather's last 2 fights were against Pacquiao and Andre Berto.\n\nMayweather is saying that this fight is going to be different. He's going to make it exciting this time for the boxing fans. If Mayweather wasn't willing to make it exciting for the fans in his last 2 fights despite making tens of millions, why would this fight be any different? Is it because he's fighting a novice that has never fought before? Is this a safe fight for Mayweather?\n\nWhat happens if McGregor hits Mayweather hard and causes him to go into the defensive mode for the remainder of the fight? What happens with all the big talk that Mayweather made about him making it exciting for the fans? Sadly, this won't be the end for Mayweather. He's likely going to be back at least one more time for a rematch against McGregor in the octagon for the boxing and MMA fans that haven't learned their lesson from buying this fight on August 26.\n\nMayweather charged the boxing fans $99 to see the Pacquiao fight on PPV, and it turned out to be a real disappointment. Following the fight, the PPV industry for boxing appeared to drop off. Some think the cause for the drop off was a backlash from fans who had felt ripped off by the high prices and the underwhelming performances from Mayweather and Pacquiao. Now the fans could get a second dose with another high priced fight involving Mayweather, but this one promises to be an even worst mismatch. It's up to the fans to make up their minds. It's a free market. If they're willing to pay to see Mayweather beat up on a fighter that has never fought a boxing match in his life, it's their choice. It's unfortunate that there could be repercussions after the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight could hurt boxing if it's another dud fight.\n\n\"We didn't ask for this. Social media was on fire because of these two guys going at it,\" Ellerbe said. \"The fans demanded this event and they're going to get it.\"\n\nEllerbe is right about the fans are \"going to get it.\" I think the fans are definitely going to get it, but they probably won't like that they're going to get. Hopefully, it'll be a good fight, but it doesn't look good right now. Even the clip released by UFC president Dana White of McGregor slapping Paulie Malignaggi around the ring didn't look good.\n\nMcGregor looked totally unskilled and amateurish the way that he was throwing punches at Malignaggi. There was no speed, power or skills on McGregor's part. He looked like almost anybody. That video showed that McGregor is little more than an MMA fighter, who doesn't know the first thing about boxing. It's too bad the full video wasn't released so the boxing and MMA fans could have seen for themselves how bad McGregor looked. They were smart to only show clips of the video instead of the entire thing. McGregor was also smart to pick the out of shape Malignaggi to spar instead of a younger fighter with speed and punching power. If McGregor had sparred someone like Shawn Porter or Errol Spence, no amount of edited footage would have helped them build up the fight. Those guys would likely slaughter McGregor wore than Mayweather, because they can actually punch and they're legitimate welterweights. Mayweather moved up from super featherweight years ago, but his power never went with him. Mayweather is still little more than a pumped up super featherweight.\n\nMayweather helped make the McGregor fight happen by him tweeting back and forth with McGregor. Mayweather clearly initiated this. The fans jumped on board AFTER Mayweather started the tweeting with McGregor. It's not as if the MMA and boxing fans decided on their own that it would be a great idea for McGregor to fight Mayweather.\n\nThis was Mayweather seeing popular fighter from another sport and initiating the tweets that started it all. It's a good thing that Mayweather didn't find someone from a non-combat sport like golf or tennis to start tweeting to try and fight, because it would be so bad.\n\n\"That's the reason that our sport isn't where football, basketball [are] ... it's because we stay in our own little box,\" Ellerbe said. \"You tell me, what is wrong with these two guys fighting? If you don't want to watch it, don't buy it. Simple as that.\"\n\nEllerbe is wrong. If he's advocating more boxing vs. MMA fights in the future, then he's wrong if he thinks it's going to help boxing. We've already seen a number of boxers try and fight in the MMA, and it always ends badly for them. That doesn't help boxing. Up until now, the MMA fighters have always been too smart to want to risk getting beaten up by going into a boxing ring to take on a top fighter. Unlike MMA, boxing takes too many years to learn. You can't pick up the sport in 1 or 2 years. If boxers continue to fight occasionally in MMA fights, they're likely always going to lose. It's going to be the same thing with the MMA fighters going into boxing. It's not fair to the fans to rip them off like that. Many of the fans don't realize that fighters from other sports can't just walk into a boxing ring and beat Mayweather. They're going to find out on August 26, and they're going to pay a lot of money to learn that lesson. But, I don't agree that the reason boxing isn't where football and basketball is right now is because they're not thinking outside the box.\n\nI don't know where Ellerbe is going with that. You can only trick the MMA and boxing public so many times before they learn and realize, 'Gee, this is not a good idea for me to pay $100 to watch an MMA fighter fight a boxer.' This is a one and done thing. If boxers keep trying to fight MMA under boxing rules, the outcome will eventually be predictable to the fans, and they will stop buying those mismatches in the future. Right now, the fans don't know better, so they're going to have to find out for themselves on August 26. But slowly the fans will eventually understand that you cannot put fighters from MMA in a boxing ring and expect them to win. It's the same with sticking a boxer in the octagon. It's not going to work. I don't think it's a good idea to rip off the public by charring them to see circus mismatches with a predicable conclusion.", "id": "9610108", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Ellerbe:

USA TODAY Sports\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe city of Dublin has no shortage of lovely spots that are easy on the eye and a visitor's delight, but Tower Road in the suburb of Clondalkin will never be described as one of them.\n\nMidway along a tight street, a single lane of often-congested traffic in each direction, is a plain brick office building where local jobseekers go in search of gainful work and to collect welfare checks to tide them over to the next week.\n\nOpposite is a former pharmacy, now bricked up, and next to that a postal center, where the services provided also include a kiosk where the welfare payments can be distributed and received.\n\nConor McGregor is expected to make more than $100 million when he fights Floyd Mayweather in a Las Vegas boxing ring on Aug. 26 but even if some unforeseen calamity cancels the fight, he no longer has a need to pass through Tower Road, or the local office of Intreo, Ireland's national employment service.\n\nMore:\n\nNevada commission (surprisingly) approves 8-ounce gloves for Mayweather vs. McGregor\n\nOne major decision is bothering Floyd Mayweather ahead of his fight against Conor McGregor\n\nYet just over four years ago, in early April 2013, McGregor patiently took his place in line, got his final social payment of 188 Euros ($221), then queued to collect it at the post office. The wait nearly caused him to miss his flight to Sweden, where he would make his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut days later, but he made it just in time.\n\n\"I told them at the welfare office, I'm about to start fighting in the UFC,\" McGregor said. \"We will see what happens.\" In Stockholm, he knocked out Marcus Brimage in 67 seconds, collected a $60,000 check for Performance of the Night, and began a remarkable journey to fame and fortune. He's never cashed another welfare check, instead collecting seven-figure sums after becoming the biggest draw in mixed martial arts.\n\nMcGregor's fighting and promotional commitments are such that it would be easier in many ways for him to be permanently based in the United States, but you can forget about that happening.\n\nThe 29-year-old is a true son of Dublin, the Irish boy from his country's capital proudly wearing the nation's colors and making sure home is not only where the heart is, but where he and his family rest their heads.\n\nMcGregor now sees a side of Dublin that was closed off to him as a youngster, his wealth providing a lifestyle vastly different from his working-class youth. It is easy and common for young men to forget their humble beginnings in such situations and on the surface McGregor would appear to be one of those, all mink coats and rented supercars and gaudy displays of wealth.\n\nYet for all the flash there is one spot that never fails to keep him somewhat grounded, Tower Road and all its memories, a place he seeks out whenever he returns home and one that offers an eternal reminder of how quickly he has risen.\n\n\"I always make a point to see it, look back, reminisce and pinch myself that I'm in this position,\" McGregor said. \"But (I) never stare. If you stare, you stay there. I look, pay homage and use it as fuel to keep going. I never become complacent or comfortable. Those are my people. I've never changed. Ask anyone.\"\n\nMcGregor's loud proclamations of self-worth and the nature of the sport he has mastered is not for everyone, especially in the snootier sections of Irish society. Among the working classes in his homeland, however, he is truly beloved, seen as the boy who made good yet never disrespected his past.\n\n\"I'm the same person,\" McGregor added. \"I've never had to change. I show up to the gym. I work hard. I show my hard work. I gain my confidence. It's been the same since day one. What I wear to the gym, my home that I go home to - those things have changed. They've become nicer. From the mental standpoint, it's stayed the same.\"\n\nThat hunger has served him well in the octagon, though whether it is enough to overcome the natural disadvantage he has as a boxing newcomer in facing Mayweather, one of the sweet science's all-time greats, remains to be seen. Regardless, nearly five million people are expected to pay to find out, boosting McGregor's earnings beyond his wildest dreams.\n\n\"I've come from shows I'm fighting in front of 100 people and 75 of those are friends of those on the undercard,\" McGregor added, referring to his time on the Irish MMA circuit before he got his UFC opportunity. \"That's where I've come from four years ago. I've come a long way. It's been a hell of a journey.\"\n\nBuild-up to Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor boxing bout Fullscreen Conor McGregor hits a heavy bag during a media workout in preparation for his fight against Floyd Mayweather at UFC Performance Institute.

Mayweather and McGregor will fight at 154 lb.\n\nThe change could be viewed as a win for McGregor, who had noted to Mayweather that he fights with 4 oz. gloves in UFC. McGregor had previously said that a lighter glove will help him knock out Mayweather in the first round.\n\n\"If we're 8 ounces, I'm struggling to give him two rounds,\" McGregor told reporters.\n\n\"The only reason I'll maybe give him two rounds is because, in this game, the referee stops me from pounding his head into the canvas and he has 10 seconds to recover. That's the only reason he might get to the second round.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, McGregor's trainer, John Kavanagh was asked about McGregor's prediction and paused before agreeing.\n\n\"Yes, I do. Obviously Floyd is an incredibly accomplished boxer, fantastic defensive boxer, but ... how many times have we seen it? [Conor] lands [a punch], people fall. And that's just how it is.

The UFC sensation said that might help give boxing fans more respect for MMA.\n\n\"(But) part of me is hoping that maybe he can last ... part of me wants to show some skill and to dismantle him,\" McGregor said Wednesday. \"We are ready for absolutely every scenario. I am ready to go to war for the full 12 rounds and I'm ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm just looking forward to August 26 and proving what I'm saying and educating the world of what martial arts is and giving the fans and everybody a good solid fight and earning my respect in this game also.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old Irishman is a sizable underdog in the high-profile, cross-sport clash, which doesn't come as a surprise given his extremely limited boxing experience -- this is his first official fight -- and Mayweather's undefeated record.\n\nYet, Brett Okamoto of ESPN.com noted UFC President Dana White believes it will be a competitive battle despite the large gap in experience.\n\n\"All these naysayers, let me tell you what,\" he said. \"This fight goes two ways. Either Floyd Mayweather runs around and does his style of fighting, defense, stays away from Conor and tries to not get hit. Conor will go right after Floyd Mayweather and try to knock him out. That's Conor's style. When have you ever seen a boring Conor McGregor fight?\n\n\"And then there's the other side, where Floyd thinks that Conor is so weak at boxing he comes right after him.

I want it to be a good fight and I truly believe it will be a good fight.\"\n\nAll told, the fact Mayweather hasn't competed in nearly two years since his victory over Andre Berto in September 2015 gives McGregor at least a puncher's chance.

Pacquiao doubts that McGregor will land one good punch during the entire fight on Mayweather.\n\nInitially, Pacquiao gave the 29-year-old McGregor no chance of beating Mayweather. But he then decided that if McGregor brawls with Floyd, he might have a puncher's chance if he lands one big lucky punch. It's not going to be easy for McGregor to land that big shot.\n\nPacquiao should know. He was whipped by Mayweather in 2015 in losing a one-sided 12 round decision in their Fight of the Century. However, Pacquiao came off like a sore loser at the fight in saying he thought he had won the fight. Pacquiao further revealed to the news media that he had an injured shoulder. Mayweather was not happy to hear Pacquiao not giving him credit, and making excuses for his loss.\n\n\"McGregor is of that school. Maybe he'll get lucky,\" said Pacqiuiao via skysports.com. \"McGregor has no chance in this fight. The guys who caught him and rumbled did best. There is no way he will be able to land a meaningful punch on Floyd. How could he? He (McGregor) has no professional experience in boxing,\" said Pacquiao.\n\nThe guys that gave Mayweather the most trouble in his career were Jose Luis Castillo, Marcos Maidana, and Miguel Cotto. That's just 3 fighters. Saul Canelo Alvarez would have given Mayweather problems if he had the sense enough to know that he need to use his size advantage to take the fight to Mayweather and brawl.\n\nCanelo didn't want to brawl though. Canelo had become spoiled, as in his previous fight against Austin Trout in April 2013, Canelo had boxed him most of the fight using the Mayweather shoulder roll. Canelo thought he could do the same thing against Mayweather, but he thought wrong. Mayweather ended up making Canelo look bad in defeating him. There's a saying, 'Don't box with a boxer.' Somehow, Canelo and his so-called expert trainers failed to realize that. Instead of Canelo using his size and what got him to that point, he fought Mayweather's fight and ended up losing a 12-round majority decision.\n\nMcGregor seems to think his experience in the UFC counts for experience in boxing. He believes he can do the same thing against Floyd that he's been doing in the UFC against the wrestler type guys he's been padding his record with.\n\nThis is going to end badly for McGregor. He doesn't have the boxing skills of the brawlers that have given Mayweather a good test in the past. I'm talking about Marcos Maidana, Castillo and Cotto. Those fighters were excellent brawlers with good basic boxing skills. McGregor is just a UFC fighter without the needed experience to give Mayweather a run for his money. An experienced fighter like Errol Spence would give Mayweather problems if he fought him on August 26, because he would push a fast pace and take advantage of the ring rust that might be there due to his 2 years out of the ring.", "id": "9579575", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Pacquiao: McGregor won't land a meaningful punch on Mayweather \" Boxing News", "image": "http://www.boxingnews24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1-Mayweather_vs_McGregor_WorldTour_NY-13.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 150, "amb": false, "textEnd": 159, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}, {"textStart": 1707, "date": "2013-04-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1717}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez"}, "id": "361148", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa\u00fal_\u00c1lvarez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miguel Cotto"}, "id": "364282", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Cotto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Austin Trout"}, "id": "390608", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Trout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marcos Maidana"}, "id": "390619", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Maidana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Luis Castillo"}, "id": "568600", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Luis_Castillo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fight of the Century"}, "id": "770779", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_of_the_Century"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 74, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 898, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 950, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods and Movements", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods_and_Movements"}], "time": "23:03:00"}

When pressed if he would ever consider stepping into the boxing ring against Mayweather, the Irishman kept it blunt.\n\n\"Duh,\" laughed McGregor. \"If you're asking would I like to fight Floyd Mayweather -- I mean, who would not like to dance around the ring for $180 million?\"\n\n\"I certainly know he would not want to step into my world. The world of pure unarmed combat where there's no limitations, but I most certainly would step into his world. I would certainly box him if the opportunity arose. Most certainly.\"\n\nThis display of confidence came fresh of Mayweather's highly publicized victory over Manny Pacquiao in May 2015. While, McGregor acknowledged a potential bout against the boxing legend would undoubtedly generate another huge number, both in pay-per-viewa and ticket sales, he also claimed Mayweather wanted nothing to do with his world in the UFC\n\n\"There's no real fight in boxing left for Floyd anyways,\" said McGregor. \"After the Manny fight happened, there's no more real draws. If you're looking for a fight that would generate interest, it must be a cross and match up different styles.\n\n\"I've said it before, I don't think boxing is the style of fighting that can beat Floyd but saying that there are many, many forms of fighting that can beat him.

This is people doubting me, questioning my skill set -- talking as if I'm a novice, talking as if I haven't been doing this my entire life,\" McGregor told the Los Angeles Times as his media day opened Friday at the UFC Performance Institute. \"I've been fighting since day one and I'm the best there is. I can fight in many forms. This here is Bruce Lee [stuff], that's where my mind is at.\"\n\nMcGregor, 29, has made his career as the UFC's first-ever simultaneous two-belt champion by pressing to take on challenges that seemed too daring, like taking on 10-year-unbeaten featherweight champion Jose Aldo, like asking for another shot at 170 pounds against Nate Diaz, and like seeking the double-belt feat in November against Eddie Alvarez.\n\nMcGregor won each, and he expects, even as a 6/1 underdog, to do the same against Mayweather, 40, who's looking to close his storied, five-division world-champion boxing career at 50-0 in their Aug. 26 bout at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nHe emphasized that point when asked if it helped to prepare with nothing to lose, knowing he has a safe landing to return as UFC lightweight champion, free to explain he only sought to test himself in a pay-per-view venture in which he stands to earn in excess of $100 million.\n\n\"The word [lose] isn't even in my vocabulary. I am here to win. I'm preparing to win -- win in devastating fashion,\" McGregor said. \"That's where we're at. I don't care about the money. I don't care about any of that. It gets to the point where the money is just up here [increasing] right at the top. I'm at that stage now. As long as I make correct decisions -- and not stupid decisions -- I'm set for life. I'm past the stage where this is for money.\"\n\nIn his Friday workout, McGregor showed off some moves without gloves in the boxing ring, then put on the gloves to hit the speed bag and heavy bags. Despite chuckles from those who watched the footage on live streams and on social media, McGregor said that's the beauty of what he's bringing Mayweather -- something the smaller champion has never seen.\n\n\"We'll come with a different approach than what he's used to,\" McGregor said. \"It forces a man to react off my creation. When you're reacting and not creating, you're in trouble. Then, factor that in with my punch power and precision. It's not going to end well. It's not going to end well for all those people doubting me, who are talking things about what this is going to be. I'm just looking forward to a post-fight education of the entire world of what true martial arts is.\"\n\nMcGregor said he opted not to retain a veteran fight trainer like Southern Californians Freddie Roach, Abel Sanchez or Robert Garcia because he wasn't sure any of them would've given him their full attention. He also spoke about the importance of his loyalty to his team, led by trainer John Kavanagh.\n\nDespite a split with sparring partner and former world champion Paulie Malignaggi, and another who said McGregor is unprepared for Mayweather's sophisticated boxing, McGregor said he dominated both men in their sessions. \"[Malignaggi] suffered head trauma, we were worried about him,\" McGregor said. He also scoffed at Mayweather's Thursday notion that McGregor could claim a consolation victory just by lasting all 12 rounds.\n\nMcGregor said his confidence is brimming so high now that he believes he can knock out Mayweather in two rounds, not four.\n\n\"You know what I heard [Mayweather] say yesterday? Nothing. I saw a man scared. I saw a lackluster workout. I saw a man trying to talk himself out of fatigue,\" McGregor said.\n\nBeyond Mayweather's age and two years out of the ring, McGregor said the fact he expects to walk into the ring at 170 pounds with Mayweather at 150 will be another significant advantage.\n\n\"I'm going to play to the rules,\" said McGregor, who has sparred under the supervision of veteran boxing referee Joe Cortez. \"It will be unusual to Floyd, but that's not my worry. You can't prepare for me. Let him try to study. There's nobody in the game who moves like me, who strikes like me or who has confidence like me.\"\n\nlance.pugmire@latimes.com\n\nFollow Lance Pugmire on Twitter @latimespugmire", "id": "9750596", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Driven by doubters, Conor McGregor convinced he will beat Floyd Mayweather Jr.", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-598ee6f4/turbine/la-sp-mcgegor-mayweather-20170811", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1146, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1153}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}, "id": "304253", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "id": "310320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}, "id": "311156", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bruce Lee"}, "id": "331634", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}, "id": "333008", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Aldo"}, "id": "361906", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Aldo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}, "id": "418449", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Freddie Roach (boxing)"}, "id": "509024", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Roach_(boxing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quintuple champion"}, "id": "606733", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintuple_champion"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 954, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "18:10:00"}

He reiterated this is the last fight of his career. He said what happened at the Unite The Right white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., was \"not cool\" but he hasn't much time to keep up with it.\n\nIt was a surprisingly subdued media session. Both Mayweather and McGregor have had plenty of explosive appearances leading up to their Aug. 26 fight.\n\nMayweather passed on offering more thoughts about how the two fighters have been treated based on their race, or further thoughts on McGregor as a person. He didn't think the switch in glove size, a big topic for McGregor one day earlier, would have much of an impact.\n\nHe also didn't seem to think referee Robert Byrd's reputation for not stepping in as often as other officials would matter, even if McGregor does try to slip in some MMA tactics to the fight.\n\n\"I truly believe the ref is going to do his job,\" Mayweather said. \"The referee's job is to demonstrate to the fighters that he is keeping the bout clean. ...

They grabbed some food, then stopped at a bookstore to browse through the mixed martial arts magazines.\n\nThey were in the infancy of their MMA careers and hoped a few seconds spent gazing through the pages might confer on them some new skill. As they were leaving, McGregor spotted Floyd Mayweather on the cover of The Ring, two fists up, a toothy grin, his eyes gazing back, too.\n\n\"Wow,\" McGregor said. \"Look at him. He is the face of boxing. He's on top of the world.\"\n\nEgan continued for the door. \"C'mon,\" he called out. But it was futile. McGregor wouldn't budge. He was holding the magazine with both hands, transfixed.\n\n\"He was visualizing himself,\" McGregor's best friend says now, \"in that position -- on the cover.\"\n\nAfter the first stop of a four-leg, around-the-world, around-the-Twittersphere-and-back-again promotional tour, McGregor -- the slightly more grown-up, pushing 30-year-old version -- took time to answer a few questions in a corner of Staples Center in Los Angeles. His light brown hair parted neatly to the side, his beard delicately manicured, McGregor wore a navy suit with two words stitched vertically over and over again into makeshift pinstripes, small enough for only a squinting observer -- or a camera -- to make out: FUCK YOU.\n\nWith a mic in hand, McGregor is a supernova, an all-world shit-talker.\n\n\"On August 26,\" he began, referring to the date of his boxing debut against Mayweather, \"this man will be unconscious. He's too small. He's too frail.\"\n\nFloyd Mayweather Sr., the father and trainer of Floyd Jr., was just to the Irishman's left. He stared down at McGregor, then interjected. \"You're gonna get killed,\" he yelled.\n\nMcGregor laughed it off. Then Mayweather Sr. asked him the question many people have wondered about since this fight was announced before a summer of bluster began.\n\n\"How the fuck you going to outbox him?\" he asked, referring to his son. He pointed his finger at McGregor and added, with this fight's trademark over-the-top shade: \"All the same fighters he beat would beat your ass.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment shared by Oscar De La Hoya, a former boxing champion turned successful promoter, who called Mayweather-McGregor a \"farce\" in a Facebook post. Former Canadian cruiserweight Troy Ross agrees.\n\n\"McGregor has never had a boxing match in his life,\" he says. \"How can he be in a ring with Floyd?\"\n\nFans, however, want to believe the impossible. They want to believe the MMA fighter with an anesthetizing left hook -- a man who calls himself Notorious and is notoriously just seven years removed from a job as a plumber's assistant and a monthly welfare check -- can knock off arguably the greatest pound-for-pound boxer of any era. It is this belief in which Conor McGregor traffics -- turning skepticism into certainty.\n\nIt's the Mystic Mac effect. He predicted he'd be the best MMA fighter in Europe, then he said he'd beat the unbeatable Jose Aldo. Then he said he'd win two UFC championship belts. All came true.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to next Saturday's bout in Vegas, fans have lined up to place their bets on McGregor. One sportsbook recorded 15 bets for McGregor to win for every wager for Mayweather. Indeed, many see McGregor's crossover as little more than a money grab, a potential nine-figure payday for both fighters and untold millions for the UFC and various boxing federations. Pundits, not to mention tweeters and everyday sports fans, have called the fight a disgrace and a race-baiting spectacle.\n\nBut inside the ring, when the two men stare into each other's eyes and the fight begins, there is something more elemental. For Mayweather, it's simple: Take out the Irish enigma and his boxing legacy is complete -- a 50-0 record to become the winningest undefeated champion in sports history.\n\nFor McGregor, the point of indulging in this -- the shitshow superfight of the century -- is more complicated: He's fighting for Ireland, but head to the streets of Dublin these days, and you'll find the Irish appalled by his behavior, calling him a phony. He boasts of winning more titles, but talk to his friends and fellow fighters about a decade of sleepless nights and proclamations on private jets, and it seems like Mystic Mac wants something unattainable -- something perhaps more permanent, something only he can see.\n\nMcGregor's first professional mixed martial arts fight took place in a tiny basketball gym in Dublin. He was deep down on the undercard, an unknown so unknown that an hour before the bell was supposed to ring, nobody noticed he hadn't shown up. Thirty minutes later, his coach, John Kavanagh, realized his prodigy was missing. He called McGregor's phone, but it was turned off. Twenty minutes until fight time, still nothing. Finally, as everyone was preparing for a forfeit and the next card, McGregor burst through the door.\n\n\"He jumped straight into the ring,\" says Owen Roddy, McGregor's striking coach. \"Bounced around, cracked his man a few times, knocked him out, then bounced out of the ring.\" Then he had a few pints for good measure.\n\nMcGregor's origin story is well-known. It's part of his allure. The Irish lad from the Southwest Dublin working class neighborhood gets bullied in school, joins a boxing gym to learn how to fight off his attackers. As the story goes, he comes from nothing and works his way to the top.\n\nIt's a neat and tidy tale, but when he was 16, McGregor's parents moved him and his two sisters to a large house in Lucan, a leafy village 20 miles from the Dublin city center. On his first day of school, Tom Egan introduced himself. On the surface, they were opposites -- Egan the loner with meticulous discipline, McGregor outgoing but entirely unreliable, often spending hours in his own head.\n\n\"He was just a lazy prick, and I don't mean that in an insulting way,\" Egan says of McGregor. \"He was just at a loss of identity, and he didn't really have anything to hold onto.\"\n\nOn weekends, McGregor would stop by Egan's parents' house and they'd watch delayed recordings of UFC fights, then mimic the moves in the back shed. During the week, McGregor trained at his childhood boxing club in Dublin, or occasionally an MMA gym near his home with Egan. It was there that Kavanagh, the \"Godfather of Irish MMA,\" noticed both McGregor's and Egan's raw talent. They became his prized pupils at the new Straight Blast Gym Ireland in downtown Dublin.\n\nMcGregor arrived determined to fight anyone. He wanted to prove himself, sure, but he was seemingly battling against his own angst.\n\nOnce, before he had a driver's license, he persuaded Egan to let him take the wheel of Egan's parents' car. He drove in perfect circles around an industrial park. He flashed his blinker at the optimal time and turned with precision. As long as he was in motion, he was in control. When it came time to park, McGregor hit the gas and made a beeline toward the spot. The car crashed into the wall and smoke billowed into the sky. He had forgotten to hit the brakes.\n\nFor brief stretches, Kavanagh managed to reel in McGregor's unpredictability. He placed him on the undercard for a small-time event, Cage of Truth 3, that Kavanagh was hosting on June 28, 2008. It was McGregor's third professional fight. At the weigh-in the day before, McGregor stared down his opponent, Artemij Sitenkov, and proceeded to announce he'd knock him out in the first round. Then McGregor turned and yelled at Sitenkov's coach, \"You can get it too, old man!\"\n\nThis wasn't performance art. There was no one in the audience.\n\nThe next day at the fight, McGregor had his own cheering section, and his family came to see him fight for the first time. But Sitenkov took him right to the ground, submitted McGregor in just 69 seconds for his first loss. The few dozen people in the gym fell nearly silent, and McGregor leaped out of the Octagon and disappeared down the hallway ashamed.\n\nThe following Monday, he didn't show up for training. He missed the next day, and the day after that as well. Instead, McGregor buried himself on his parents' couch. Egan reached out, but McGregor's mate was absorbed in his own career, destroying opponents in the 175-pound division on the Irish MMA circuit.\n\nEventually, Kavanagh convinced McGregor to come back to the gym, and he won his next fight by TKO. But there was no epiphany, and soon he was back on his parents' couch. The 69-second fight he'd promised to win had slapped him with such force that inertia set in. McGregor didn't fight for another 22 months.\n\nMeanwhile, Egan signed on to fight the undercard in June 2009's UFC 93 in Dublin. It was a seminal moment in Ireland, as Egan became the first Irish-born fighter to compete in the big leagues of MMA. McGregor, sitting a few rows back from the cage, saw the kind of champion he wanted to be: an Irishman, inside the Octagon, in the UFC.\n\nThere's a tale about the great Celtic warrior Cu Chulainn, perhaps the most famous of all the Irish myths. It starts with a boy raised in a small town and the children who attempt to bully him. He learns to fight back with such rage that he rapidly transforms himself into the most potent fighter in the land.\n\nHe is also a braggart, a flashy warrior in search of everlasting fame. He lives on a knife's edge and makes as many enemies as friends. But, as with any mythological tale, Cu Chulainn (pronounced Kook-hullen) knows that one day there will be a reckoning. It will either be a spectacular victory or a fail of epic proportions.\n\nIn 2009, as the rise of McGregor began, his country's economy was crumbling. So Kavanagh gave McGregor a job teaching boxing at the SBG gym to help supplement his unemployment check, and McGregor resumed regular training with an eclectic group of fighters.\n\n\"We turned up every day to John's Place,\" says Paddy Holohan, one of the fighters. \"We were just in this shed, closed off to the world.\"\n\nIn tiny gyms around Ireland, McGregor reeled off eight straight wins, after starting his career 4-2. With each victory, he became more arrogant and defiant. Even as far back as 2011, he was lambasting other fighters on Irish message boards. In one post, under the username NOTORIOUS, he wrote:\n\n\"vote for me for fighter of the year how can you not ... broken orbital bones, broken jaws, broken noses, fighters retired ... EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM ARE RUNNING SCARED EVERY SINGLE ONE!!!!!\"\n\nHe defended his Cage Warrior championship, and the UFC signed him to a five-fight contract. In April 2013, on his way to the airport for the first one, in Stockholm, Sweden, McGregor cashed his last unemployment check. After TKO-ing the journeyman Marcus Brimage in the first round that Saturday, he earned $16,000 for the victory and another $60,000 for the \"knockout of the night.\"\n\nWhile the younger generation in Ireland was celebrating one of its own, old-school fight-watchers found Mystic Mac's personality grating.\n\n\"He has utterly divided Irish society, not along socio-economic grounds, but by age,\" says Sean McGoldrick of the Sunday World, a newspaper in Ireland. \"We like our sports stars to be humble.\"\n\nIf you walk the streets of Dublin, even three weeks before the Mayweather fight, you'll run into plenty of McGregor fans. But many others feel he's negatively affected the perception of the country.\n\nSitting inside a French restaurant on Fade Street, in a tightly tailored suit, Sean, a salesman in his early 40s, says McGregor \"is playing what people think an Irishman is -- it's not very Irish at all.\"\n\nDown the road at Jo'Burger, conversation turns to McGregor, and one of the waiters jumps in unprompted: \"He doesn't represent us in the best way.\"\n\nThe waiter pauses and lets out a smile. \"I still want him to win.\"\n\nThe beard grew, and the tattoos followed. McGregor had started to create the fighter he imagined himself to be. For his second UFC fight, in the summer of 2013 in Boston, he called Egan and asked him to work in his corner.\n\nThe old friends had exchanged a few emails but hadn't seen each other in years. After Egan's loss in UFC 93, he moved across the Atlantic seeking a new challenge, but found it difficult to break through. When he reconnected with McGregor, he saw a \"completely different individual.\"\n\nMcGregor was training alongside Gunnar Nelson, an Icelandic fighter who helped teach him to channel his emotions within the Octagon. He was also honing Mystic Mac's fighting IQ. McGregor \"has this amazing ability,\" says Roddy, his striking coach. \"You could bring in a guy brand-new -- he's never seen him -- and within a minute, he has him worked out and has his patterns read.\"\n\nThe most important shift, however, came when McGregor's sister handed him a copy of Rhonda Byrne's self-help book, The Secret. The bestseller details a version of the law of attraction in which your thoughts manifest your desires. He read passages from the book out loud, then passed it around the gym.\n\n\"Conor was the one that wanted to be the best,\" says Holohan, who kept training alongside McGregor long after the unemployment checks gave way to millions. If McGregor wanted Ferraris and five-digit spending sprees, they happened. If he wanted to win belts, well then, through his emboldened belief system that, too, would happen -- miracle of miracles.\n\nMcGregor stopped ruminating and spread the enthusiasm to those closest to him.\n\n\"He gets me so motivated,\" says Artem Lobov, a teammate at SBG. \"I could be going into the shop to buy a sausage roll and I feel like I'm fighting for the world title.\"\n\nIn Boston, McGregor won at UFC Fight Night by decision. He also tore his ACL in the first round, which forced him out for the next 11 months. That winter, he holed up in a house in Reykjavik, Iceland, with some of the SBG gang. The sun was only shining five hours a day, night turning into more night, but McGregor rarely slept.\n\nHolohan, his roommate in the Nordic mansion before there was Mac Mansion in Las Vegas, remembers waking up at 4 a.m. to find McGregor watching fights on his iPad. So he sat up and talked through the intricacies of the fighters on the screen. But McGregor always talks -- and inevitably, the conversation would turn to Mayweather. They imagined stepping into the ring against Money, who had just taken a $41.5 million purse for defeating Canelo Alvarez by decision in 12 rounds, and just how \"easy it would be for an MMA fighter,\" Holohan says, to beat his ass.\n\nWhen you compare it to MMA, the two friends agreed, \"boxing is very, very easy.''\n\nOver time, thoughts of taking on Mayweather began to crystallize. In the spring of 2015, McGregor was on a 10-city promotional tour for his upcoming fight against Jose Aldo. McGregor and his team jetted across three continents on a UFC-chartered plane. Halfway through the tour, most of Camp Conor returned to Ireland, leaving only McGregor and Lobov onboard. The days blended together, but at one point, Lobov remembers, they were seated next to each other, 40,000 feet above ground.\n\nMcGregor leaned in: \"I want to box,\" he told his friend on the jet. \"I want Mayweather.\"\n\nHe went on to beat Chad Mendes when Aldo pulled out, then beat Aldo anyway five months later, winning the UFC featherweight title. He jumped up a division to lightweight and lost for the first time in 15 fights, this time to Nate Diaz. After the fight, he told commentator Joe Rogan: \"I'm humbled in victory or defeat. I respect Nate.\"\n\nIt is that kind of humility -- however forced -- that the older Irish generation wants so badly from its stars, that for the first time -- however briefly -- united his home country behind him. For McGregor, adoration was no consolation. His visions of grandeur were now looking garish.\n\nDuring the weigh-in for his rematch with Diaz a year ago at UFC 202, McGregor strode up to the scale in a blue tank top, his mouth nearly frothing. He took off his top, stood on the scale, flexed his muscles and screamed at the crowd.\n\nWhen Diaz approached the scale, McGregor stood next to Kavanagh, his coach, and -- according to MMA journalist Ariel Helwani -- whispered in his ear: \"The illusion of insanity is over. Now back to the game plan.\"\n\nOf course, McGregor won the fight against Diaz and, in November, won at UFC 205 against Eddie Alvarez, too. They were formalities, really. The countdown to the Mayweather fight had started years ago.\n\nBy the time their cross-country trollfest had reached Brooklyn one afternoon last month, McGregor taunted Mayweather with racist comments, repeatedly telling Mayweather, \"dance for me, boy.\" He also told the crowd of more than 13,000 at Barclays Center that he was \"half-black from the belly down.\"\n\nTwo hours later, McGregor was forced to respond to his own responses on an L-shaped runway. He wore a long fur coat with no shirt and patterned pants. Holding a water bottle in his right hand, twisting it nervously between his fingers, he shifted in place. \"I'm a big fan of the culture,\" he said, when asked about his comments about African-Americans. But it did little to quell the outrage. More pointed questions came, centered around the point of this shitshow in the first place: Did McGregor deserve to be fighting this fight? Was he given something he hadn't earned?\n\nA few feet away from the uncomfortable interview, McGregor's small team from back in the Dublin gym remained undaunted. Lobov, with the same energy that McGregor displays from weigh-ins to private planes, exclaimed that his friend is \"better than Mayweather. He is going to dominate him, 100 percent. Believe it.\"\n\nBelief, however, can become intoxicating. It can make you believe in your own myth.\n\nToward the end of the tale of Cu Chulainn, the fighter's hubris has pushed him to the brink. A life's worth of enemies begins to conspire against him. They force the war hero to eat a plate full of dog meat and then pierce him, one by one, with magical spears. Before the final blow can reach him, the legend decides to tie himself to a tree and face his killers head-on.\n\nThe great Celtic warrior, it turns out, is not immortal. He dies standing up.", "id": "9511886", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "True Stories of the Incredible, Unbelievable, Unstoppable Conor McGregor!", "image":

I'm very happy with it,\" McGregor told reporters on a conference call.\n\nMayweather had nearly all of his 49 professional wins using eight-ounce gloves, which may accentuate one of his advantages - his hand speed.\n\nMcGregor preferred the lighter gloves since he is used to the fingerless, four-ounce gloves typically worn in MMA.\n\n\"That's it in a nutshell, you've got pros and cons on both sides,\" he said. \"Favors us both in certain ways.\n\n\"I believe now that the gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor added.\n\n\"Part of me ... kind of wants to show some skills and dismantle him that way. (But) I do not foresee him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nWhile most pundits have McGregor, who has never boxed professionally, as a heavy underdog, the Dubliner said he was determined to prove the doubters wrong.\n\n\"I'm just looking forward to Aug. 26, going in and proving what I'm saying and educating the world on what martial arts is,\" he said. \"And earning my respect in this game also.\"\n\nThe Irishman said his grueling preparations for the fight would enable him to triumph no matter how the fight develops.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I am not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\" McGregor added.\n\n\"The training sessions and the practice that we've been putting in has been through hell and back. We are ready for absolutely every scenario.\n\n\"I'm ready to go to war for the full 12 rounds and I am ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds. That's where my head's at.\"\n\nDana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), followed McGregor on the conference call and predicted the fight could even threaten the reported $600 million haul from the Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao 2015 showdown.\n\n\"This is the biggest event ever in combat sports history. This is the most distributed event in pay-per-view history,\" White said, also citing the additional digital reach.\n\n\"This thing is in like 200 countries on pay-per-view. Boxing doesn't usually do a lot of digital.

The NSAC's own rules state that their 154-pound bout requires 10-ounce gloves. Such rules were enacted for the safety of the fighters involved.\n\nThe Association of Ringside Physicians considered the matter of such importance that it sent a letter to the NSAC asking it not approve Mayweather's request to allow the smaller glove size.\n\nThe NSAC will decide on Wednesday whether or not to approve the move to 8-ounce gloves.\n\nFollow MMAWeekly.com on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram", "id": "9597617", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Floyd Mayweather Wants Smaller Gloves to Increase Odds of KO'ing Conor McGregor", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 88, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Sporting Goods", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Sporting_Goods"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}], "time": "03:22:00"}

And by the sounds of it, no fight in history will be bigger than Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor.\n\nThat statement is a little crazy, considering the most-hyped boxing bout of all time involves only one real boxer. Mayweather is unquestionably one of the greatest to step between the ropes, and is arguably the top defensive boxer the sport has ever seen.\n\nThe guy is a ghost in the ring, with elite footwork, hand speed and overall boxing smarts mixing together for a potent counter-punching potion that brings Mayweather into this August 26 fight with an unblemished record of 49-0 and has only seen the five-division title holder in trouble a handful of times during his 21-year career.\n\nThat's why Mayweather opened as a -10,000 favorite when this matchup with MMA star McGregor was rumored in May 2016 - a realistic line for such a mismatch in boxing skill. This line has since morphed into a reflection of the sportsbooks' need to have \"public friendly\" odds on the biggest fight ever as well as the mainstream support for McGregor - with a heaping of hatred for Mayweather stirred in.\n\nRegardless of the current odds, Mayweather is the overwhelming favorite and deservedly so. That makes giving three reasons why you should bet on Mayweather over McGregor very easy. Almost as easy as this fight should be for Floyd...\n\nReason No. 1: The odds\n\nAs mentioned above, this bout is priced for the public. Priced to sell, if you would. That opening line of Mayweather -10,000 is an unbettable number - asking bettors to wager $10,000 to only win $100. No sports gambler, sharp or square, would get involved in that.\n\nThat's why when the fight was close to official, most sportsbooks either opened or adjusted their Mayweather-McGregor betting odds to Mayweather -1,000 with McGregor coming back as a +700 underdog. And even that was a lot to ask from the casual bettors - wagering $1,000 to win $100 on Mayweather - which explains the one-sided action on McGregor and the massive swing in the fight odds.\n\nPublic players and MMA enthusiast have piled on the Irishman, eyeing that underdog payday, betting McGregor with both fists in the months leading up to fight night. Those $10, $20, $50 and $100 bets have slowly accrued into a mountain of liability for sportsbooks, with the random large bet on Mayweather temporarily tempering the line adjustments.\n\nYou can now get Mayweather around -550, almost half the price of the opening line. To put those odds into perspective, Mayweather was a -3,500 fave versus Andre Berto in September 2015, a -230 favorite against Manny Pacquiao in May 2015, and around -1,000 in his second bout with Marcos Maidana back in September 2014.\n\nSure, Mayweather has been out of the gloves for some time since those bouts but he handled those world-class fighters with ease. Now he's going against a first-time boxer and is discounted like Halloween candy on November 1.\n\nAs my colleague, Patrick Everson, wrote when the odds were Mayweather -1,000, \"If this was your 401(k) plan or an IRA, you'd be thrilled at a 10 percent return on investment.\" Now you're getting almost 20 percent - minus the $100 bones to watch this bet cash live on pay-per-view.\n\nReason No. 2: The skill\n\nWe've already touched on Mayweather's talents in the ring as well as his undefeated record. But despite those things and probably in good part to Mayweather's polarizing personality, he still doesn't get the credit he deserves.\n\nBoxing purists and they're now few and far between, will gladly rank Mayweather's work in the ring among the all-time pound-for-pound best fighters. His out-of-ring antics and legal issues definitely tarnish what should be a celebrated sports career.\n\nCompuBox statistics state that Mayweather has landed 43.4 percent of his career punches while limiting foes to just under 19 percent - a +24.5 plus/minus rating. Plus he's only gotten better with age, taking down world-class competition in the final decade of his career.\n\nMcGregor is known as a striker in the UFC, picking up 18 of his 21 professional MMA victories via knockout. That stat line should be taken with a grain of salt, or better yet an entire winter-busting bag of rock salt. McGregor was able to kick, grapple, tackle, elbow, and all but bite his opponents in those bouts - in 4-ounce gloves, no less. On August 26, he can only use his fists which will be covered by eight-ounce gloves. Mayweather won't have to worry about takedowns and rear-naked chokes.\n\nYes, Mayweather is 40 years old and 11 years the senior of his opponent, and hasn't been in the ring since September 2015. But he doesn't have the wear and tear that a boxer his age should have. He's only suffered one recorded knockdown in his storied career (was more a reaction to breaking his hand on Carlos Hernandez's face in 2001) and he's absorbed punishment in just a few fights. There is plenty of tread left on those $400 million tires.", "id": "9555074", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "How does Mayweather-McGregor hype and handle compare to the boxing&...",

Fighters in bouts at 147 or under wear eight-ounce gloves.\n\nMayweather, the 49-0 boxer who has won world championships in five weight classes in a career that began in 1996, had first come up with the idea of wearing eight-ounce gloves on Twitter last week. McGregor, the UFC lightweight champion who normally fights with four-ounce gloves, quickly agreed.\n\nThe commission often pays lip service to its duty to protect the health and safety of the fighters, but looked ridiculous in changing the rules designed to do just that because of the significant amount of money the bout will generate.\n\nIt's also why a match between a 49-0 boxer and a pro debut boxer was approved.\n\nIt is unlikely - even extremely unlikely - that either McGregor or Mayweather will suffer serious head trauma in the bout. While McGregor has no pro boxing experience, he is one of the best mixed martial artists, not just active but of all time, and he knows his way around the ring.\n\nBut the regulations were put into place for a reason, and this ruling simply creates liability should a tragedy occur.\n\nSkip Avansino, its longest-serving commissioner, noted that in 2006 when the new glove-size rule was enacted, the commission said a study should be conducted to determine if there is evidence whether glove-size in and of itself is a significant safety factor.\n\nNot shockingly, that study wasn't done. It will be now, though. Eleven years after the fact and only seconds after members made themselves look like fools by essentially turning over regulation of the event to Mayweather Promotions and the UFC with a unanimous vote to permit eight-ounce gloves, they promised the study will be conducted after the fight.\n\nWell isn't that great for the health and safety of the fighters. I'm sure boxers and mixed martial artists everywhere are thankful to the commission for its care and concern.\n\nChairman Anthony Marnell scolded representatives of Mayweather and McGregor for forgetting to include a proposal for the boxers to wear eight-ounce gloves instead of 10-ounce when the commission originally approved the event.\n\n\"My biggest concern about this consideration or this request that is being made is that I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media bout between these two,\" Marnell said. \"That part of this request, it pisses me off, I'll be really, really honest with you. I respect the fact that you missed this and you admitted that in your testimony that you may have missed this subject when you guys put this bout agreement together.\n\n\"But this body is not the subject of two fighters who want to go back and forth like these two have at each other to create social media stir and another controversy for attention to sell tickets [and] to sell DirecTV. However, in saying that, I would like to put that aside and I would just caution going forward that this body, this forum, not be used for that again.\"\n\nThat comment is laughable on so many levels, but particularly given that the fight itself was made via social media. This isn't something the promoters dreamed up; McGregor floated the idea on social media and fans did it from there. It was made because of demand on social media, and to suggest that the commission is offended by a request to wear smaller gloves for a fight that began via social media is simply ludicrous.\n\nRead More\n\nThe commission was going to do whatever it took to get this bout. That's the bottom line. It wanted the money that will flow from this event. Much of the money will support Nevada tourism and boost the economy, and that's a good thing. And now that the commission is self-funding, this event will put it on solid ground.\n\nBut it's time for those five commissioners to stop with the sanctimonious talk about wanting to protect fighters.

In just over a week, the once-retired all-time great boxer Mayweather will take on UFC's biggest star McGregor in Las Vegas with millions more watching around the world.\n\nAfter all the speculation about whether we would have the fight, the last few months have seen much name-calling and animosity on both sides, as the rivalry intensifies ahead of the big day.\n\nDepending on your point of view, it will either be boxing match of the millennium or a cross-code money-spinning abomination. Whichever camp you're in, here's everything you need to know about the fight between a boxer with a 49-0 record facing a man who has never taken part in a professional boxing fight.\n\nWhat date is the fight and at what time?\n\nThe fight is happening on Saturday 26 August. While the times haven't been announced, it will certainly be a late night or very early start for viewers in the UK, so expect to be up well into Sunday 27 August, and possibly calling in sick on Monday 28. It's likely to be after 4am BST, but may start closer to 5am.\n\nWhere is the fight taking place?\n\nThe bout will be housed in the T-Mobile arena on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada. The venue has held major fights in the past, including UFC 202, in which McGregor beat Nate Diaz on points.\n\nHow can I watch it on TV?\n\nSky Sports Box Office will show the hugely-anticipated clash for \u00a319.95 in the UK and \u20ac24.95 in the Republic of Ireland.

William Hill put the veteran fighter at 1/11 favourite. He's now 2/9 with just over a week to go.\n\nOddsmaker Nick Bogdanovich said the odds would be even more lopsided if it wasn't for the deluge of small bets expected to come in from UFC fans on their fighter.\n\n\"Realistically if we were just putting up a number and didn't have to take bets on it, Floyd would be 1/100,\" Bogdanovich said. \"But this will be a very, very big betting fight for sure, one of the biggest ever.\"\n\nMayweather v McGregor betting tips including a 20/1 offer on Mayweather to win >>\n\nTHE FIGHT IS ON. pic.twitter.com/KhW0u3jRft -- Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA)\n\nJune 14, 2017\n\nHow has the rivalry developed in the last few weeks?\n\nThe pair embarked on a four-day tour last month that took in trips to London, Los Angeles, Toronto and New York.\n\nThe tension reached a crescendo at the SSE Arena in Wembley, when after trading profanities, the UFC fighter said: \"Four years ago I fought in London at The Forum in front of about 500 people. Now here I am about to quadruple my net worth with one half a fight. Sign me up. No one is going to kick, knee or elbow. And it's against this little b****.\"\n\nThere was also controversy in New York when McGregor was accused of racism after saying \"I'm half-black\".\n\nWhat are their fighting records?\n\nMayweather retired in 2015 with an unblemished 49-0 professional boxing record.\n\nHe is widely regarded as one of the best defensive fighters ever, and prides himself on his ability to evade punishment with his skillful movement about the ring while making adjustments against opponents on the fly.\n\nA win for Mayweather would move him ahead of former heavyweight great Rocky Marciano, who also retired with a perfect 49-0 career record.\n\nMcGregor, the UFC's reigning lightweight champion and former featherweight champion, is known as much for his bravado as for his explosive knockout power inside an MMA octagon.\n\nThe 28-year-old Irishman became the first UFC fighter to hold two belts simultaneously when he knocked out Eddie Alvarez in New York last November for the lightweight championship.\n\nThe UFC stripped McGregor of his featherweight belt shortly after that fight when he announced he would be taking some time off after he and long-time partner Dee Devlin had their first baby in May.\n\nKnown for his devastating striking and highlight-reel knockouts, McGregor is also quick and irrational on his feet, but few would back him to beat one of the most complete boxers of all time.\n\nWhat are the rules of the fight?\n\nThe fight will be held under boxing rules, presenting a huge challenge for mixed martial artists McGregor as he faces off against one of the greatest defensive boxers in history.\n\nAdding to McGregor's challenge, the fighters will be using 10-ounce boxing gloves instead of the smaller UFC gloves and he will not be allowed to use the leg kicks or takedowns that are used in mixed martial arts.\n\nMcGregor will weigh in at 154 pounds, UFC president Dana White told ESPN. The pair will wear 8oz gloves, which you can read more about here.\n\nWho is referee, who are the judges? REFEREE: Robert Byrd JUDGES: Burt Clements, Dave Moretti and Guido Cavalieri\n\nVastly experienced American referee Robert Byrd will be the third man in the ring, with the judges confirmed as Burt Clements, Dave Moretti, both American, and Guido Cavalleri, of Italy, after McGregor's team had requested an international judge in the trio.\n\nByrd refereed Mayweather's unanimous points decision victory against Robert Guerrero four years ago. Mayweather's last three fights were refereed by Kenny Bayless, but he was ruled out after critical comments from McGregor's head coach John Kavanagh.\n\nByrd, a veteran of major fights, is seen as a referee who allows the fighters to work on the inside, often keeping a respectful distance, using his voice to command the bout and make boxers break.\n\nByrd has also recently bossed the high profile contests between Andre Ward and Sergey Kovalev, Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez's win over Miguel Cotto and George Groves' unsuccessful challenge of Badou Jack.\n\nWhat have they said? Floyd Mayweather Jr\n\nIn the first stop of a four-city media tour promoting the fight, told the 20,000-strong crowd in Los Angeles: \"I don't care if it's a ring or it's an octagon, I will kick ass. I don't back down for anybody.\n\n\"You line them up and I will knock them down. On August 26, I'm gonna knock this b**** out too.\"\n\nMcGregor retorted: \"You haven't knocked anyone out in about 20 years.\"\n\nMayweather added: \"We talking about from the nineties to now, world champion 18 years, but it is no problem. I'm not the same fighter as I was years ago, but I got enough to beat you.\n\n\"You will wave that white flag. You are going out on your face or your back. Which was do you want to go? All you need to do is show up and I will do the rest.\n\n\"God only made one thing perfect, and that is my boxing record.\"\n\nConor McGregor\n\nThe Irishman was the crowd favourite at the opening press event as he made fun of Mayweather's IRS troubles - a lack of cash prompted him to file an appeal with the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) regarding overdue taxes - and promised to flatten an aging fighter.\n\n\"He's in a track suit,\" McGregor told the crowd of more than 11,000 people. \"He can't even afford a suit anymore.\"\n\n\"I am honoured to be here, to give you this spectacle,\" McGregor said. \"His little legs, his little core, his little head, I am going to knock him out inside four rounds, mark my words.\n\n\"I am a young, confident, happy man that has worked extremely hard for this.\n\n\"I am just up here embracing everything. No-one can do anything to me. I am just enjoying myself and having a good time.\n\n\"He will be unconsciousness in four rounds. He has never faced this. I don't fear him.\n\n\"All these rules, all these restrictions, it doesn't faze me; it amuses me. It is funny to me all these rules.\n\n\"All I need is a gum shield. Line me up to the ring and I am good to go.\"\n\nWho are celebrities backing to win?\n\nHere is a selection of big names here.\n\nAnd who do you think will win?\n\nFloyd Mayweather v Conor McGregor

That's the way it should be, according to boxing's biggest star, because he is risking everything he spent 20 years building as a professional prizefighter for a fight he didn't need.\n\n\"I truly believe I'm taking the bigger risk,\" Mayweather said during a conference call Thursday. \"There's a big reward for both, but I'm taking the bigger risk. You know, I have the 49-0 record. And when a fighter has lost before, if he lose again they say, 'Oh, it's nothing. He lost before.' But when a fighter has been dominating for 20-something years and never lost, everything is on the line - my legacy, my boxing record, everything is on the line.\"\n\nIreland's McGregor is a two-division champion in UFC and its most popular figure at the moment. But the powerful southpaw, who'll make his pro boxing debut against Mayweather, has lost three times in MMA matches (21-3, 18 KOs).\n\nThe 40-year-old Mayweather, meanwhile, hasn't even considered the possibility of losing to a huge underdog who has helped him build their fight into what could become the most profitable boxing match in the sport's history.\n\n\"I just really try to focus on being positive and just worry about going out there and doing what I do best,\" Mayweather said. \"You know, I try not to think about losing or taking an 'L.' That's not really my focus. You know, every day I tell myself, 'I'm a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring, but I was born to be a winner.'\n\n\"So whatever I do, I try to give it a hundred percent and I try to push myself to the limit. But like [Showtime's] Stephen [Espinoza] said, it's all about taking risks. And I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks. I don't mind putting the 49-0 record on the line. I don't mind putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

I'll tell you this, I just watched him work out last night, he looks phenomenal, he's in great shape. He hits hard and now we're fighting in 8oz. gloves and this is going to be a fight.

White admits that he's unsure, but he did say that the Irishman has said that he'll be fighting in the UFC again:\n\n\"Conor has told me he's going to fight again this year, but I don't know what's going to happen,\" he said. \"You can't put these guys on the shelves all this time.

I'm ready to go to war for 12 rounds and I'm ready to put him away early on.\"\n\nUlimtate Fighting Championship President Dana White also believes the gloves switch could shape the outcome of the fight.\n\n- 'Hits like a truck' -\n\nThe move is widely seen as benefiting both fighters -- Mayweather's fast hands could be quicker with lighter gloves, while McGregor will be able to make his punching power more keenly felt, provided he can land a blow on his American opponent.\n\n\"I think it affects the contest a lot,\" White said when asked if McGregor would be helped by the change.\n\n\"Yes, Floyd will be faster with eight-ounce gloves but he's more defensive. Conor hits like a truck, so smaller gloves helps him big time. I think it absolutely does.\"\n\nMcGregor and Mayweather will climb into the ring following an international publicity tour last month marked by expletive-laden tirades and trash-talking.\n\nMcGregor, who was criticized for addressing Mayweather as \"boy\" during one event, dismissed suggestions that there was a racially tinged dimension to the duel.\n\n\"For me, it's athlete versus athlete,\" McGregor said. \"I'm disappointed to hear the way it's being portrayed. All I can do is stay focused on my craft and go out and put a performance for my fans.\"\n\nMcGregor, meanwhile, said he has used disparagement by the boxing community as motivation.\n\n\"It has certainly been motivating, the disrespect and the disregard for my skill set,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"I look at people so many times and their mind is closed to how things can be done. It's a set way and there is no other way. Well, if that was the case we would have never reached across the oceans in search of other lands. We would never have gone into space.\n\n\"You have to have an open mind and you got to realize that there are other ways. Fighting is a complex game. But I'm just looking forward to August 26 and proving what I'm saying and educating the world of what martial arts is.\"\n\nShares", "id": "9647843", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "McGregor vows fast finish against Mayweather - Capital Sports", "image": "http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/files/2017/08/d05f13955548556ce9443bfeb942ae6dfc6acbe9.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 135, "amb": false, "textEnd": 144, "freq": 3, "date": "2017-08-26"}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 228, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 234}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}, "id": "311156", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trash-talk"}, "id": "325883", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash-talk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Duel"}, "id": "336430", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punching power"}, "id": "420928", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punching_power"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 896, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "08:13:00"}

To ensure they do, they will be inspected by the chairman and executive chairman on the evening of the fight. The gloves must also be given to the NAC after they're used.\n\nRobert Byrd was appointed to referee the bout and the judges were also selected at the meeting.

If you have lost before it's OK, but if you are 49-0, as I am, everything is on the line.\"\n\nMcGregor has lost three of his 24 mixed martial arts contests. This will be his first professional boxing match, one expected to draw five million pay per view buys and shatter all records as the richest fight in history, potentially grossing over 700 million US dollars\n\nBut Mayweather believes the UFC's Irish mixed martial arts star will employ potentially underhand tactics when they face off here in their mega-fight on August 26.\n\nAnd the richest boxer in history reiterated that this really will be his very last fight, after which he intends to tighten up his business interests for his family for \"generations to come\".\n\nMayweather watched clips of McGregor in training against former two weight world champion Paulie Malignaggi. \"I see a lot of rabbit punches behind the head, grappling, wrestling, illegal shots,\" Mayweather said on an international media conference call.\n\n\"Some may call that a KO (over Malignaggi), but it doesn't matter as it is just in the gym. What counts is in the ring. Paulie has retired and he is now commentating and traveling around the world. McGregor is active and hard in training.\"\n\n\"But the ref will be fair on both sides, I want him to be even. I want us to have a good solid fight.\"\n\nMcGregor will receive severe financial penalties - contractually - if he employs anything beyond the skills of boxing as he does in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, in which kicks, elbows and knees can be employed, as well as choke holds.\n\nMcGregor has hired retired referee Joe Cortez to oversee his sparring, and that was not lost on Mayweather, who said he did not see Cortez stepping in when he might have in the sparring.\n\n\"I truly believe Robert Byrd is going to do his job, his job is to keep the bout clean,\" Mayweather added. \"We are going to have a hell of a fight. Like I have said, I am coming straight ahead.\"\n\n\"I look forward to following the Queensberry rules of boxing. McGregor had referee Joe Cortez in his training camp but I still see him being extremely dirty. But my job is not to referee the fight, I am going to do my job. I am not worried about the outcome, I am more worried about excitement.\"\n\nMayweather had also said in recent television interviews that he may be prepared to fight McGregor in a rematch, perhaps even in a mixed martial arts fight, but was insistent that this will be his last walk to a fight ring.\n\n\"I thought Andre Berto (September 2015) was going to be last weigh-in, last training camp, my last everything,\" Mayweather explained. \"But you just never know what can happen and we are here with this big event. This is my last one, ladies and gentlemen. I gave my word to Al Haymon (his business and boxing adviser), my children, and I don't want to break that. I want to stick to my word. This will be my last fight.\"\n\n\"I now want my children to go to College, and do what I was never able to do,\" explained 40-year-old Mayweather. \"They will be able to turn 100 million in my business into 300 million.

I think that's where he can be most intense but fighting up close is the hardest thing in boxing to learn and I don't think you can do that in a few months.\"\n\nMcGregor, 29, has employed retired Hall of Fame referee Joe Cortez in order to adapt to boxing rules for his debut in the sport against undefeated Mayweather, who will come out of retirement for the 26 August bout in Las Vegas.\n\nMayweather, speaking to a teleconference of journalists around the world, said: \"He had Joe Cortez in his camp but I still saw him being extremely dirty. My job is not to worry about the referee but to let the referee do his job.\"\n\nRobert Byrd, himself a Hall of Fame referee, has been chosen to officiate the T-Mobile Arena bout.\n\nMayweather, 40, will surpass Rocky Marciano's perfect record of 49 fights without defeat should he avoid loss against McGregor. The Las Vegas-based fighter retired in 2015 but is adamant this will now be his final contest, stating he has \"given my word\" to his family and advisor Al Haymon.\n\nHe is a heavy favourite with bookmakers to score a 50th win almost 21 years since his professional debut. On Wednesday, McGregor said he expected to win inside two rounds.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport during Thursday's teleconference, Mayweather added: \"I truly believe I am taking a bigger risk but it's a big reward for both of us. I have the 49-0 record. When a fighter has been dominant for 20 odd years, everything is on the line.\n\n\"I just try to focus on being positive. I try not to think about taking a loss. Everyday I tell myself I'm a winner. I was born to be a winner in life. Whatever I do I try to give 100% and go to the limit.\n\n\"It's all about taking a risk and I wouldn't be where I'm at. I don't mind putting the 49 and 0 on the line, I think it's worth it.\"\n\nBBC Radio 5 live boxing analyst Steve Bunce:\n\nIt's going to be a relentless week. Too many people are treating it like a comedy carnival. On the night I think it will be a lot more serious than people think. I think the laughter will stop in Las Vegas, probably around Wednesday.\n\nMcGregor is a guy who was nowhere four years ago. Now he can earn hundreds of millions of dollars. He got there because he is absolutely driven. I've seen his fights, I think he likes hurting people. So there will be dark undertones next week. Anyone who thinks Mayweather doesn't have a nasty, dark side has been living in a cave for 30 years.\n\nI believe McGregor has picked up a lot from Mayweather.

I'm very happy with it,\" McGregor told reporters on a conference call.\n\nMayweather had nearly all of his 49 professional wins using eight-ounce gloves, which may accentuate one of his advantages - his hand speed.\n\nMcGregor preferred the lighter gloves since he is used to the fingerless, four-ounce gloves typically worn in MMA.\n\n\"That's it in a nutshell, you've got pros and cons on both sides,\" he said. \"Favors us both in certain ways.\n\n\"I believe now that the gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor added.\n\n\"Part of me ... kind of wants to show some skills and dismantle him that way. (But) I do not foresee him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nWhile most pundits have McGregor, who has never boxed professionally, as a heavy underdog, the Dubliner said he was determined to prove the doubters wrong.\n\n\"I'm just looking forward to Aug. 26, going in and proving what I'm saying and educating the world on what martial arts is,\" he said. \"And earning my respect in this game also.\"\n\nThe Irishman said his grueling preparations for the fight would enable him to triumph no matter how the fight develops.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I am not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\" McGregor added.\n\n\"The training sessions and the practice that we've been putting in has been through hell and back. We are ready for absolutely every scenario.\n\n\"I'm ready to go to war for the full 12 rounds and I am ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds. That's where my head's at.\"\n\nDana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), followed McGregor on the conference call and predicted the fight could even threaten the reported $600 million haul from the Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao 2015 showdown.\n\n\"This is the biggest event ever in combat sports history. This is the most distributed event in pay-per-view history,\" White said, also citing the additional digital reach.\n\n\"This thing is in like 200 countries on pay-per-view. Boxing doesn't usually do a lot of digital. If you're in Manhattan or on a desert island somewhere, if you have Wifi you can buy this fight.\"\n\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford)\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

Twitter/@Maclifeofficial\n\nMcGregor, who is widely seen as a massive underdog against undefeated former welterweight king Mayweather, predicted an early finish to the fight.\n\n\"Particularly with the eight-ounce gloves, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" said McGregor, nevertheless expressing the hope that the fight would last longer.\n\n\"I don't want people saying 'Oh, it was a lucky punch' and all that. Part of me is hoping maybe he can last so I can show some skill and dismantle him that way.\n\n\"But I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first few rounds.\"\n\nThe charismatic 29-year-old said a grueling training camp has taken him to \"hell and back\" and left him ready to face any kind of scenario inside the ring at the T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I'm not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"We are ready for both scenarios. I'm ready to go to war for 12 rounds and I'm ready to put him away early on.\"\n\nUlimtate Fighting Championship President Dana White also believes the gloves switch could shape the outcome of the fight.\n\n'Hits like a truck'\n\nThe move is widely seen as benefiting both fighters -- Mayweather's fast hands could be quicker with lighter gloves, while McGregor will be able to make his punching power more keenly felt, provided he can land a blow on his American opponent.\n\n\"I think it affects the contest a lot,\" White said when asked if McGregor would be helped by the change.\n\n\"Yes, Floyd will be faster with eight-ounce gloves but he's more defensive. Conor hits like a truck, so smaller gloves helps him big time. I think it absolutely does.\"\n\nMcGregor and Mayweather will climb into the ring following an international publicity tour last month marked by expletive-laden tirades and trash-talking.\n\nMcGregor, who was criticized for addressing Mayweather as \"boy\" during one event, dismissed suggestions that there was a racially tinged dimension to the duel.\n\n\"For me, it's athlete versus athlete,\" McGregor said. \"I'm disappointed to hear the way it's being portrayed. All I can do is stay focused on my craft and go out and put a performance for my fans.\"\n\nMcGregor, meanwhile, said he has used disparagement by the boxing community as motivation.\n\n\"It has certainly been motivating, the disrespect and the disregard for my skill set,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"I look at people so many times and their mind is closed to how things can be done. It's a set way and there is no other way. Well, if that was the case we would have never reached across the oceans in search of other lands. We would never have gone into space.\n\n\"You have to have an open mind and you got to realize that there are other ways. Fighting is a complex game. But I'm just looking forward to August 26 and proving what I'm saying and educating the world of what martial arts is.\"\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 02:52 pm | Updated Date: Aug 17, 2017 02:52 pm\n\nTags :#Boxing#Conor mcgregor#Dana white#Floyd mayweather#Mma#Showtime boxing#Sportstracker#Ufc", "id": "9653520", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Conor McGregor says Floyd Mayweather won't last two rounds against him in upcoming clash", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/McGregor-3-Social.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 377, "amb": false, "textEnd": 386, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}, {"textStart": 3363, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3375}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "228323", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Profanity"}, "id": "309393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}, "id": "311156", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trash-talk"}, "id": "325883", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash-talk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Duel"}, "id": "336430", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Punching power"}, "id": "420928", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punching_power"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 896, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "09:35:00"}

I gave my word to my children. And one thing I don't want to do is break that. ... This will be my last fight,\" Mayweather said Thursday at a media conference call for his Aug. 26 fight against Conor McGregor.\n\nMayweather, who retired after earning a unanimous-decision win over Berto in September 2015, spent most of the conference call reflecting on a career that ranks among the greatest in boxing history. He would set an all-time record with 50 wins without a defeat should he beat McGregor, breaking a tie with Rocky Marciano.\n\n\"I don't try to focus on other fighters, but I'm appreciative for every fighter that paved the way for me to be where I'm at,\" Mayweather said. \"Even though this is No. 50, this is my 50th fight, that's not my focus. My focus is to give the fans an exciting fight. ... Rocky Marciano is a legend. Rocky Marciano did it his way. I'd just like to it the Mayweather way.\"\n\nMcGregor, the most famous face in mixed martial arts, is making his boxing debut after becoming the first fighter in UFC history to simultaneously hold two championships. Some have wondered whether McGregor, in the prime of his career, is taking too big of a risk switching sports altogether in a match that could lower his star power.\n\nMayweather said he believes his decision to put his undefeated record on the line is more of a risk.\n\n\"I believe I'm taking the bigger risk, I have the 49-0 record,\" Mayweather said. \"When a fighter has lost before, if he loses again, they say it's nothing he lost before. But when a boxer has been dominating for twentysome years, never lost, everything is on the line. My legacy, my boxing record, everything is on the line.\"\n\nMayweather also doubled down on his comments acknowledging that he may have lost a step at age 40.\n\n\"I'm just being honest, I don't think I'm the same Floyd Mayweather I was 21 years ago, of course not. I don't think I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago. I'm not even the same Floyd Mayweather I was five or two years ago. But I said I still have a high IQ in that ring, and I said experience wise it leans towards me,\" he said.\n\nThe fight will take place using eight-ounce gloves, rather than the standard 10-ounce gloves, thanks to a waiver granted by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. McGregor typically fights using four-ounce gloves in UFC while boxing typically requires 10-ounce gloves for any weight class above 147 pounds.\n\nMayweather said that was put in place to avoid excuses on either side, saying, \"I'm not really worried about the outcome, I'm worried about excitement. I understand he's used to fighting in four-ounce gloves...I want to make him feel as comfortable as possible. I'm not going to have any excuses, and I don't want him to have any excuses.\"", "id": "9799568", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Floyd Mayweather Says Conor McGregor Fight Is His Last, Talks Legacy on Call", "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/689/938/hi-res-933655007ce77fa071a9bfa6f4409261_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 405, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 412}, {"textStart": 521, "date": "2015-09-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 535}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Intelligence quotient"}, "id": "314767", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Al Haymon"}, "id": "383903", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Haymon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Weight class"}, "id": "385813", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andre Berto"}, "id": "390617", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Berto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rocky Marciano"}, "id": "521934", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Marciano"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 60, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 403, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain Names", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain_Names"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 898, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "23:31:00"}

Sorry to disappoint, but Marc Goddard won't be the referee.\n\nVeteran referee Robert Byrd will be in charge of the action in the ring, marking just the second time he's handled a Mayweather fight before. Byrd's first time reffing Floyd was his 2013 win over southpaw Robert Guerrero. Other notable recent major boxing events Byrd has featured in include the first Andre Ward vs. Sergey Kovalev matchup, as well as Miguel Cotto vs. Canelo Alvarez. He's a well-respected official who has been in the fight game for more than three decades.\n\nYour three judges at ringside will be Dave Moretti, Burt Clements, and Guido Cavalleri. Moretti and Clements were two of the judges who scored the Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight in 2015, with Moretti having Floyd winning 118-110, while Clements went a bit closer at 116-112. Cavalleri scored 115-112 for Mayweather over Marcos Maidana in their 2014 rematch, and otherwise has an extensive history judging fights outside the United States. I guess you can argue Cavalleri is the \"international judge\" McGregor's team wanted.\n\nLet's get to the much bigger story, which is the NAC's decision to approve (just once!) eight-ounce gloves for Mayweather vs. McGregor. The plan was for ten-ounce gloves, which is the actual NAC rule dictating as follows: (via ESPN)\n\n\"Athletes (boxers/kick boxers) weighing-in up to and including 135 pounds must wear 8 oz gloves in competition, while athletes weighing-in over 135 pounds (junior welterweight class and above) must wear 10 oz gloves in competition. However, athletes weighing-in over 135 but (no) more than 147 may wear 8 oz gloves in competition if both athletes agree to do so in writing on their bout agreement (contract).\"\n\nWell despite the Association of Ring Physicians (ARP) letter to the commission recommending that they don't change their rules \"Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of the bout,\" the NAC went ahead and changed the rules.\n\nMMA Fighting's Marc Raimondi has the details:\n\nThe commissioners, citing a lack of scientific evidence for their glove size rules dictated by weight class, all gave their approval. Chairman Anthony Marnell did say he was upset that Mayweather and McGregor had used the commission for promotion on social media.\n\n\"I do not like the Nevada State Athletic Commission being used as a pawn in a social media bout,\" Marnell said. \"Between these two, that part of this request pisses me off.\n\n\"This body is not the subject of two fighters ... to create social media stir and other controversy to sell tickets and to sell DirecTV.\"\n\nCommissioner Skip Avasino, the commission's most tenured member, said since it was a hybrid fight -- an MMA fighter coming in and facing a boxer -- they could grant a waiver for this occasion. But he recommend a scientific study that was first supposed to be done in 2006 regarding glove size.\n\nYou couldn't make it up, could you? Keep in mind that Mayweather's team was the one pushing for eight-ounce gloves, just like they did for the 2012 fight against Miguel Cotto. Funnily enough, that request was denied.\n\nOh yeah, and two weeks ago, NAC executive director Bob Bennett was on record as saying this:", "id": "9541893", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "NAC appoints judges and ref, approves 8oz gloves for Floyd/Conor", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vM84Oz1hPBrvtL4qH3-iY2AkS6g=/0x0:2278x1281/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56222483/814500796.0.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 287, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 298}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "id": "305867", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}, "id": "314692", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "DirecTV"}, "id": "319917", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Guerrero"}, "id": "323972", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Guerrero"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Light welterweight"}, "id": "347124", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andre Ward"}, "id": "358400", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Ward"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sergey Kovalev (boxer)"}, "id": "358401", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Kovalev_(boxer)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez"}, "id": "361148", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa\u00fal_\u00c1lvarez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miguel Cotto"}, "id": "364282", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Cotto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Weight class"}, "id": "385813", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marcos Maidana"}, "id": "390619", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Maidana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 562, "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 564, "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Governing Bodies", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Governing_Bodies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "18:03:00"}

Part of me is hoping maybe he can last so I can show some skill and dismantle him that way.\n\n\"But I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first few rounds.\"\n\nThe charismatic 29-year-old said a grueling training camp has taken him to \"hell and back\" and left him ready to face any kind of scenario inside the ring at the T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I'm not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\" McGregor said. \"We are ready for both scenarios. I'm ready to go to war for 12 rounds and I'm ready to put him away early on.\" Ulimtate Fighting Championship President Dana White also believes the gloves switch could shape the outcome of the fight.\n\nThe move is widely seen as benefiting both fighters -- Mayweather's fast hands could be quicker with lighter gloves, while McGregor will be able to make his punching power more keenly felt, provided he can land a blow on his American opponent. \"I think it affects the contest a lot,\" White said when asked if McGregor would be helped by the change.\n\n\"Yes, Floyd will be faster with eight-ounce gloves but he's more defensive. Conor hits like a truck, so smaller gloves helps him big time. I think it absolutely does.\" (AFP)\n\nMcGregor and Mayweather will climb into the ring following an international publicity tour last month marked by expletive-laden tirades and trash-talking.\n\nMcGregor, who was criticized for addressing Mayweather as \"boy\" during one event, dismissed suggestions that there was a racially tinged dimension to the duel.\n\n\"For me, it's athlete versus athlete,\" McGregor said. \"I'm disappointed to hear the way it's being portrayed. All I can do is stay focused on my craft and go out and put a performance for my fans.\"", "id": "9875136", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "McGregor: I'll fast finish Mayweather", "image": "      http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/image/view/-/4062222/medRes/1731788/-/bp34yw/-/pic+mywhret.gif", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 176, "amb": false, "textEnd": 185, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Profanity"}, "id": "309393", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trash-talk"}, "id": "325883", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash-talk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Punching power"}, "id": "420928", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punching_power"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 170, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 564, "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Governing Bodies", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Governing_Bodies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 827, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 896, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "10:38:00"}

McGregor(21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC), meanwhile, competes in the octagon, where four-ounce gloves are standard equipment. Who's got the advantage?\n\nWith less sheathing to cover his heavy hands, some might say McGregor. If you ask the guy who helped him get new gloves, he doesn't necessarily see it that way.\n\n\"Nobody can talk about this fight better than Conor, but I think what Conor would say to that is, Conor would be happy to fight in 16-ounce gloves, or no gloves at all,\" said attorney Mike Mersch, who represented McGregor on Wednesday during the meeting that prompted the commission to break an 11-year-old rule. \"He'd be happy to fight in a boxing ring, or in an octagon. He'd be happy to fight in boxing shoes, or in bare feet. He's ready for this fight. He doesn't care what the size of the gloves are.\n\n\"When this challenge was thrown down by Floyd, Conor immediately accepted. I don't think there's much more to it than that. Conor's ready to fight.\"\n\nThe UFC lightweight champ's attorney is no stranger to the NSAC's rules - he helped write them. A former deputy attorney general, he was on the subcommittee that wrote the rules requiring boxing fights at 147 pounds and under to use eight-ounce gloves, while fights above require 10-ounce gloves.\n\nMersch later took a job with the UFC, eventually becoming the promotion's senior VP of business, legal and government affairs. The commission, meanwhile, never completed a study to test the effectiveness of its new glove regulations.\n\nRaymond \"Skip\" Avansino, the NSAC's most senior member, ordered that study to be completed as a condition of a special one-time exemption from the rule.\n\nMersch agrees with the commission that a change is warranted given the special circumstances surrounding the Aug. 26 blockbuster. He said if anything, the Showtime pay-per-view event at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas provides a catalyst for re-examining the current rules.\n\nOf course, it's a very lucrative catalyst for the commission - which takes a portion of the box office - McGregor, and definitely Mayweather, who said he could make $350 million in one night's work.\n\n\"If there's a fight to try this out as a potential test case, I can't think of a better fight than this one,\" Mersch said.\n\nThe boxing gloves to be used for \"The Money Fight\" have yet to be announced, but the Mayweather and McGregor camps say they will be an American-style glove with more padding on the fist, as opposed to a \"punchers glove\" typical of Mexican-made gloves. Three pairs will by provided to the NSAC for inspection - and inclusion into the glove study.\n\nAs to which fighter has more weight behind his punches, that advantage seems tilted to McGregor. Mersch told the commission the Irish champ will likely be 160 pounds or higher on fight night, while Mayweather will be 150.\n\nFor more on \"The Money Fight: Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor,\" check out the MMA Rumors section of the site.\n\nJul 13, 2017; Brooklyn, NY, USA; during a world tour press conference to promote the upcoming Mayweather vs McGregor boxing fight at Barclays Center.

I'm very happy with it,\" McGregor told reporters on a conference call.\n\nMayweather had nearly all of his 49 professional wins using eight-ounce gloves, which may accentuate one of his advantages - his hand speed.\n\nMcGregor preferred the lighter gloves since he is used to the fingerless, four-ounce gloves typically worn in MMA.\n\n\"That's it in a nutshell, you've got pros and cons on both sides,\" he said. \"Favours us both in certain ways.\n\n\"I believe now that the gloves are eight ounces, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor added.\n\n\"Part of me ... kind of wants to show some skills and dismantle him that way. (But) I do not foresee him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nWhile most pundits have McGregor, who has never boxed professionally, as a heavy underdog, the Dubliner said he was determined to prove the doubters wrong.\n\n\"I'm just looking forward to Aug. 26, going in and proving what I'm saying and educating the world on what martial arts is,\" he said. \"And earning my respect in this game also.\"\n\nThe Irishman said his gruelling preparations for the fight would enable him to triumph no matter how the fight develops.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I am not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\" McGregor added.\n\n\"The training sessions and the practice that we've been putting in has been through hell and back. We are ready for absolutely every scenario.\n\n\"I'm ready to go to war for the full 12 rounds and I am ready to put him away in the first 10 seconds. That's where my head's at.\"\n\nDana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), followed McGregor on the conference call and predicted the fight could even threaten the reported $600 million haul from the Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao 2015 showdown.\n\n\"This is the biggest event ever in combat sports history.

Even though much of the focus on the Aug. 26 showdown between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor has been on the UFC lightweight champion's jump from the Octagon to the ring, somewhat lost in the shuffle has been that Mayweather has declared this bout at T-Mobile Arena will be his final fight.\n\n\"I thought that (the Andre Berto fight) was going to be my last everything,\" Mayweather said on Thursday's media teleconference, referring to the 2015 bout after which he retired. Yet earlier this year, the war of words between Mayweather and McGregor turned into a real fight that pulled the Grand Rapids native out of retirement for next week's meeting.\n\nBut after this one, that's it, said \"Money.\"\n\n\"This is my last one. I gave my word to (adviser) Al Haymon, I gave my word to my children and I don't want to break that. I want to stick to my word. This will be my last fight.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, a lot of the questions asked of Mayweather focused on his past. Yet while the 49-0 future Hall of Famer brought up his fights with Diego Corrales, Phillip Ndou, Arturo Gatti, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and Canelo Alvarez as ones that his fans point out to him as favorites, the 40-year-old was non-committal when it came to picking the one fight when he thought he was at his best. In fact, he said he doesn't even like to watch his own fights.\n\nRELATED: Get tickets for the biggest fight in combat sports history | Don't wait. Pre-order Mayweather-McGregor now\n\n\"It's hard for me to watch my fights,\" he said. \"It could be a fight against any guy that the fans and people say they love the most, but when I look at it, I'm like, 'I could have done this better, I could have done that better.' I'm a critic of myself and I feel like it's never good enough.\"\n\nMayweather has been more than good enough over the last two decades since he competed in the 1996 Olympics, as he won titles in five weight classes and became the best boxer of this era. His place in Canastota is secure, but there is the looming ghost of the 50-0 mark, which would allow Mayweather to pass Rocky Marciano's 49-0 record as he walked off into the sunset.\n\n\"I'm appreciative for every fighter that paved the way for me to be where I'm at,\" Mayweather said. \"I appreciate the legendary fighters. This is my 50th fight, but that's not really my focus. My focus is to go out there and give the fans an exciting fight, even though I know this is number 50, and we're constantly talking about Rocky Marciano. Rocky Marciano is a legend, he did it his way and I'd just like to try to do it the Mayweather way.\"\n\nHe has done it his way, changing the economics of the sport outside the ring while he beat all comers inside it. Next week, Conor McGregor will try to shock the world and beat Mayweather in his first professional boxing match. It's a risky proposition for the Irishman, but Mayweather believes he's the one with everything on the line in Vegas.\n\n\"I truly believe I'm taking a bigger risk,\" he said. \"I have the 49-0 record, and when a fighter has lost before, if he loses again, they say, 'Oh, it's nothing, he lost before.' But when a fighter has been dominating for 20-something years and never lost, everything is on the line.

He has reffed both MMA and boxing bouts so he was on our list - but we are happy with the selection.\"\n\nThe NSAC also selected Italy's Guido Cavalleri among the three ringside judges after accepting McGregor's request for one non-US representative. He said: \"I believe it's a fair mix across the board - there's Americans and a European.\"\n\nAsked about the critics of his boxing debut - which he labelled \"disrespect and disregard\" - McGregor remained combative, insisting he could end Mayweather's perfect career record.\n\n\"They have a closed mind,\" McGregor said. \"If that were always the case, we'd have never reached across the waters in search of other lands.

Referee - Hall of famer Robert Byrd. Judges - Burt Clements. Dave Morreti and Guido Cavalerri. 8oz gloves approved. With pre and post fight analysis of the gloves on the night. This was handled very well and very fairly by the NSAC.

'It's a set way and there's no other way'. \"If that was the case we'd never have reached across the waters and searched for other land, and never have gone into space.\n\n\"When I hear their disrespect, I use it as motivation and I look forward to going in and educating them. I get it. I'm coming in (to the sport), I understand where it's at, I'm just looking forward to proving what I'm saying and earning my respect in this game also.\n\nMcGregor faces Mayweather in a fortnight (Getty)\n\n\"I've seen some videos, but it's light-hearted, I don't take it personally. If anything I see stiffness in every single one of them. With that skill-set, it's how you can change a jab to a hook in the blink of an eye, or a jab to an uppercut. It's the same thing as the hip-flexors for a kick. If I'm tight in the hips and can't free my legs, I can free my shoulders like I showed...\n\nRead more The breakdown: McGregor's essential stats ahead of Mayweather fight\n\n\"These are just age-old training methods. That shoulder method you saw was made very popular by the great Rickson Gracie, one of the pioneers of mixed-martial arts. It's a shoulder-loosening exercise: you've got to do it correct though.\n\n\"David Haye is a man who's pulled out of contests over a sore baby toe so he must be careful with the way he hits the pads. We will educate as we go forward.\"\n\nMcGregor also again dismissed any notion that there is a racial element to next weekend's fight; the August 26 promotional tour had concluded with Mayweather accusing him of racism on stage at Wembley Arena.\n\nFirst video of Conor McGregor boxing shows him battling former IBF champion\n\n\"This is athlete versus athlete,\" he said. \"I was upset that Floyd tried to bring that in, he and his people truly know that it's not from me. I'm not saying that there aren't people on both sides that have this mindset where it's black versus white, but it's certainly something I do not condone. This is athlete versus athlete, two prime physical condition athletes taking part in an amazing event.\n\n\"I'm disappointed to hear the way it's sometimes been portrayed, but it's just the nature of the game with the way things are going on in the world at the moment. All I can do is stay focused and look to put on a great performance for the fans who are supporting this event as a whole.\"\n\nMore about: Conor McGregor Floyd Mayweather Mayweather vs McGregor Reuse content", "id": "9649887", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Conor McGregor reveals what is spurring him on ahead of Floyd Mayweather fight", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/15/17/mcgregor-12.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 371, "amb": false, "textEnd": 380, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}, "id": "305090", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}, "id": "321554", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Getty family"}, "id": "342859", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_family"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "David Haye"}, "id": "541544", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Haye"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 407, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Consulting", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Consulting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1052, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1124, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur"}], "time": "07:56:00"}

Part of me is hoping maybe he can last so I can show some skill and dismantle him that way.\n\n\"But I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first few rounds.\"\n\nThe charismatic 29-year-old said a grueling training camp has taken him to \"hell and back\" and left him ready to face any kind of scenario inside the ring at the T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I'm not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"We are ready for both scenarios. I'm ready to go to war for 12 rounds and I'm ready to put him away early on.\"\n\nUlimtate Fighting Championship President Dana White also believes the gloves switch could shape the outcome of the fight.\n\n'Hits like a truck'\n\nThe move is widely seen as benefiting both fighters -- Mayweather's fast hands could be quicker with lighter gloves, while McGregor will be able to make his punching power more keenly felt, provided he can land a blow on his American opponent.\n\n\"I think it affects the contest a lot,\" White said when asked if McGregor would be helped by the change.\n\n\"Yes, Floyd will be faster with eight-ounce gloves but he's more defensive. Conor hits like a truck, so smaller gloves helps him big time. I think it absolutely does.\"\n\nMcGregor and Mayweather will climb into the ring following an international publicity tour last month marked by expletive-laden tirades and trash-talking.\n\nMcGregor, who was criticised for addressing Mayweather as \"boy\" during one event, dismissed suggestions that there was a racially tinged dimension to the duel.\n\n\"For me, it's athlete versus athlete,\" McGregor said. \"I'm disappointed to hear the way it's being portrayed. All I can do is stay focused on my craft and go out and put a performance for my fans.\"\n\nMcGregor, meanwhile, said he has used disparagement by the boxing community as motivation.\n\n\"It has certainly been motivating, the disrespect and the disregard for my skill set,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"I look at people so many times and their mind is closed to how things can be done. It's a set way and there is no other way. Well, if that was the case we would have never reached across the oceans in search of other lands. We would never have gone into space.\n\n\"You have to have an open mind and you got to realise that there are other ways. Fighting is a complex game.

The Irishman, set to make upwards of $80 million for the fight, also played down any racist undertones to the bout and has used the boxing world's dismissal of his chances of beating Mayweather as \"deep motivation\".\n\n\"I'm very happy with how the Nevada State Athletic Commission handled it. It was handled fairly and they listened to both requests,\" said McGregor.\n\nNevada rules have stipulated since 2006 that boxing matches between fighters over 147lbs must see the use of 10oz gloves. However, both McGregor and Mayweather submitted formal requests to the commission asking for it to issue a waiver for their fight, which is being fought at 154lbs.\n\nThe commissioners voted unanimously in favour of the request on Wednesday, with the appointment in the same sitting session of Robert Byrd as referee and Burt Clements, Dave Moretti and Guido Cavalleri as judges.\n\n\"Overall their approach to the decision, judges and referee was fair throughout, with them taking into consideration both fighters' requests,\" McGregor added.\n\nThe gloves simply intensify the challenge, he believes. \"I think that's it in a nutshell. You have pros and cons on both sides,\" he said. \"Both athletes were asking for it, and me, I'm coming up in ounces from what I am used to. Hey, look what I fight with. I fight in 4oz fingerless gloves. It benefits both of us in certain ways.\"\n\nMcGregor added that he is motivated by being written off by the boxing world. \"It's certainly motivating. The disrespect of my skill-set. I look at people and their minds are closed. 'It's a set way and there's no other way'.\n\n\"If that was the case we'd never have reached across the waters and searched for other lands, and never have gone into space.\n\n\"When I hear their disrespect, I use it as motivation and I look forward to going in and educating them. I get it. I'm coming in, I understand where it's at, I'm just looking forward to proving what I'm saying and earning my respect in this game also.\"\n\nMcGregor also ruled out any racial element in next weekend's contest, after Mayweather had accused him of racism at the Wembley Arena press conference.\n\n\"This is athlete versus athlete,\" he said. \"I was upset that Floyd tried to bring that in, he and his people truly know that it's not from me.\n\n\"I'm not saying that there aren't people on both sides that have this mindset where it's black versus white, but it's certainly something I do not condone. This is athlete versus athlete, two athletes in their prime physical condition taking part in an amazing event.\n\n\"I'm disappointed to hear the way it's sometimes been portrayed, but it's just the nature of the game with the way things are going on in the world at the moment. All I can do is stay focused and look to put on a great performance for the fans who are supporting this event as a whole.\"\n\nFloyd Mayweather v Conor McGregor: fight stats 00:42", "id": "9662215", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Conor McGregor: 8oz gloves for Floyd Mayweather fight will suit me", "image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2017/08/17/TELEMMGLPICT000137226435-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqaa32uTkJtbZIoyF887AAgzTGWZLzMXxwNCCYH19mu1M.jpeg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "231057", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wembley Arena"}, "id": "306915", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Arena"}, {"label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "id": "308238", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Light middleweight"}, "id": "315817", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_middleweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 527, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 544, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 562, "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 564, "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Governing Bodies", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Governing_Bodies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "10:22:00"}

The other instance was four years ago, a unanimous decision win over Max Holloway, in a non-championship match lasting 15 minutes.\n\nThe maximum fight time vs unbeaten boxing icon Floyd Mayweather (49-0), in McGregor's very first professional boxing match, is 36 minutes - 12 three-minute rounds.\n\nSo if he gassed out against Diaz, albeit in five-minute rounds where he also had to grapple, how will his cardio hold up against a fighter who calls himself - with arguable justification - The Best Ever? Especially when Mayweather has gone the distance 19 times in 12-round fights, against world championship-class opposition?\n\nMayweather himself raised the question this week, while Diaz's boxing trainer Richard Perez also panned McGregor's hopes.\n\n\"No, he doesn't have a punchers chance - and he gasses out,\" Perez told BJ Penn Radio, raising old allegations of substance abuse. \"I don't care how hard he trains.\n\n\"There's no way he's going to do this without taking any substances, and be strong in boxing, because boxing is a lot of stamina.\"\n\nLIVE stream Mayweather v McGregor Weigh Ins & Prelims on FOX SPORTS.

His struggles can partly be pinned on extra weight - he was fighting at 170 pounds, up from his usual 145/155 pounds at featherweight/lightweight. The Mayweather fight is at 154 pounds.\n\nSpeaking on the Conan O'Brien Show, he was defiant about his stamina.\n\n\"Yeah, we've made slight adjustments in my cardio preparation,\" the 29 year-old said, maintaining his prediction of a knockout victory within four rounds.\n\n\"It's actually been very enjoyable to go from five five-minute rounds, which is what we're used to, which is 25 minutes, to 12 three-minute rounds of boxing, which is 36 minutes. Slight adjustments, but we are more than ready. I've done 12 rounds last night, I've done multiple 12-round fights in the gym in the lead-up to this. We are more than ready.\n\n\"Floyd is praying for me to fatigue in there, but I will not fatigue. I will continue to press forward, and I will break him. At 40 years of age, he will not sustain my pace. So, that is it.\"\n\nMcGregor elaborated speaking to the Telegraph, claiming he had been using a nutrition regime called the 'McGregor Fast Programme' after he lost his first match-up with Diaz.\n\n\"We formulated it for the Diaz rematch and he was a triathlete with a big weight advantage and he could go for days. He had an unrivalled gas tank,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"We came up with special formula and we created the McGregor fast programme and I've been on that since a week after that first loss.\n\n\"We've adjusted certain timings in my cardiovascular preparation. The endurance phase has been stretched out to accommodate the twelve three-minute rounds.\n\n\"You've got to factor in that there's not as much grappling. There is still grappling, but not to the extent of a mixed martial arts bout where you can end up on your back and you've got to tactically work your way back to your feet which is very draining. It's a different kind of cardio training. We've adjusted some things and I feel absolutely amazing.\"\n\nMcGregor KO's former champion\n\n0:18\n\nTwo former UFC champions have weighed in on McGregor's chances, one writing him off, the other giving him some hope.\n\nFormer bantamweight champion TJ Dillashaw said the Irishman's cardio would not hold up against Mayweather and also took the little-held view that 'Money' was the harder puncher - and therefore the biggest beneficiary of a reduction in the glove size to eight ounces.\n\n\"Mayweather's going to make him miss, he's going to make him get tired,\" Dillashaw told FightHype. \"McGregor, in my opinion, doesn't have the cardio and [Mayweather] is going to take advantage of that in the later rounds.\n\n\"[8oz gloves are] to his advantage ... to Mayweather's. I think Mayweather is the heavier hitter. Even though it [doesn't look] like it when Conor fights in MMA ... we are wearing 4oz gloves, it's a little bit of a different story. I still think Mayweather is the heavier hitter.\"\n\nEddie Alvarez, who had his lightweight title taken by McGregor via spectacular KO, said his rival could get Mayweather early but risked knockout himself if he went deep into the fight.\n\n\"A lot of boxing fans are looking at Conor like he's never ever boxed. Even the way they're talking, it's like they're writing him of like he's never boxed,\" Alvarez told UFC media.\n\n\"I boxed. He understands boxing. I think that his chance is going to happen within the first four rounds. And Conor can, I think you're a fool if you don't think Conor can put Floyd away. I think he can, I think he can land a punch and put Floyd away.\n\n\"I think if it goes past the fourth round, where it can become a technical boxing match, I think it can look one-sided. Floyd's the king of that. He's the king of kind of swimming and not getting wet, he can punch and not get hit. I think if it goes further past five, six, seven, eight, he could win by TKO. Before that time, that's where Conor's time is.\"\n\nFormer lightweight champ @EAlvarezFight gives his take on #MayweatherMcGregor, and how he sees the fight playing out \u1f5e3 \u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/ydtMaB7jzU -- UFC (@ufc)\n\nAugust 14, 2017", "id": "9861787", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Mayweather vs McGregor fight news: Where Floyd could humiliate Conor", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3bd2427bd6d962dfa69ecfa96036b28c", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 6008, "date": "2017-08-14", "amb": false, "textEnd": 6023}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox Sports (United States)"}, "id": "305437", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}, "id": "307599", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}, "id": "308747", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company"}, {"label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "id": "310320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}, "id": "311156", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grappling"}, "id": "325886", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}, "id": "333008", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}, "id": "348069", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision"}, {"label": {"eng": "Max Holloway"}, "id": "363094", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Holloway"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foxtel"}, "id": "391409", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxtel"}, {"label": {"eng": "T.J.

Floyd's legacy, for instance, was important to one of the reporters who spoke. Racism, not surprisingly, is what obviously interested the caller from the New York Times. Floyd, however, remained the same laid back guy he has largely been with the media in recent years.\n\n\"I haven't had time to focus on anything but this event,\" he claimed, which anyone who has closely followed Mayweather knows is most likely true. Yet Mayweather also made it clear that he was as serenely confident as ever. \"I'm not really worried about the outcome,\" he said, referring to the match itself. Floyd, however, was still Floyd, no matter how over the hill he wants to come across to the media these days. When asked about his early struggle to make it as a star, for instance, the 49-0 slickster suddenly came alive.\n\n\"Floyd Mayweather has never been struggling,\" he asserted. \"Me and (boxing guru) Al Haymon joined forces.\" When asked about the notorious Paulie Malignaggi - Conor McGregor sparring session the public has seen clips of, Mayweather also made it clear that he found McGreggor to be a dirty fighter. \"A lot of shots were illegal,\" he noted. When queried as to whether he was worried about McGregor fighting dirty when they meet in the ring, though, Mayweather stated that he's \"pretty sure the referee is going to be fair on both sides.\"\n\nTruth be told, Mayweather is always interesting to listen to speak. Love him or hate him, he's an fascinating individual. If McGregor rides on overdrive with the media, Mayweather likes to sprinkle his talks with interesting asides. For every boast (\"My real estate portfolio is truly amazing.\") there's something telling about the man that's offered. Like the fact that he refuses to watch his own fights. \"When I look at them,\" Mayweather said, \"I'm like I could have done this better I could have done that better.\" There's also his interesting take on Rocky Marciano, the man whose 49-0 record most assume Mayweather will best in a week from Saturday.\n\n\"Rocky Marciano is a legend,\" he claimed. \"Rocky Marciano did it his way. I just want to do it the Mayweather way.\"\n\nOne interesting side note:\n\nNo one - not a single person - asked Mayweather why he chose a man who has never had a boxing match in his life as his supposed last opponent. Perhaps those who spoke already had asked that question previously. Or perhaps those who were allowed to ask questions didn't think it was important.\n\nOr perhaps they simply didn't want to hear the answer.", "id": "9893967", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Floyd Mayweather Media Call: \"This Is My Last One\" | BoxingInsider.com", "image": "https://www.boxinginsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/002_Floyd_Mayweather.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 63, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 74}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}, "id": "303936", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Al Haymon"}, "id": "383903", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Haymon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rocky Marciano"}, "id": "521934", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Marciano"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 291, "label": "dmoz/News/Media", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 292, "label": "dmoz/News/Media/Services", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 465, "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 558, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Wordplay", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Wordplay"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 560, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Style Guides", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Style_Guides"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}], "time": "12:40:00"}

My legacy. My boxing record. Everything is on the line.\"\n\nThe fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite scepticism about how competitive it will be.\n\nMayweather, a master defensive technician and tactician, is heavily favoured to win the August 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said that, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.\n\nMayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather. \"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago.

But commissioners agreed the unusual circumstances of the bout made it possible to grant the one-time exception, which the Association of Ringside Physicians strongly cautioned against in a letter submitted prior to today's meeting.\n\nTo satisfy safety concerns, three stipulations were also added to the approval: The eight-ounce gloves and their alternate must be inspected and approved by NSAC Chairman Anthony Marnell and executive director Bob Bennett; the gloves must be submitted to the NSAC after the fight; and those gloves be used for a study on glove size conducted by the NSAC (via Twitter):\n\nToday's #MayweatherMcGregor news? Eight-ounce gloves have been approved. Does this guarantee a knockout? pic.twitter.com/hU2520G6YZ\n\n-- MMAjunkie (@MMAjunkie) August 16, 2017\n\n\"The Money Fight\" takes place Aug. 26 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The NSAC regulates the pay-per-view event.\n\nMcGregor expressed pleasure with all of the NSAC's decisions today, including assignments of referee and judges.\n\n\"I am very pleased with the Nevada State Athletic Commission's handling of my next bout today,\" McGregor said in a statement on his website TheMacLife.com. \"Fair play was kept all the way through. Referee - Hall of famer Robert Byrd. Judges - Burt Clements. Dave Morreti and Guido Cavalerri. Eight-ounce gloves approved, with pre- and post-fight analysis of the gloves on the night.\n\n\"This was handled very well and very fairly by the NSAC. I am very pleased and respect the commission's ruling on this. Ten days until fight time.\"\n\nLongtime NSAC commissioner Raymond \"Skip\" Avansino, who raised the initial motion for approval, noted a study had been ordered in 2006 after a safety committee had determined standardized weights and glove sizes. But the study had never been completed.\n\n\"That's the rule for at least 11 years,\" Avansino said. \"However, rules need to be reconsidered from time to time.\"\n\nMarnell offered a token of objection by noting the request had come out of a social media battle between Mayweather (49-0 boxing) and McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC), forcing the commission to address the issue after the two agreed to fight at 154 pounds.\n\n\"Frankly, that part of it, it pisses me off,\" Marnell said.\n\nBut several commissioners ultimately decided that the bout's referee, veteran official Robert Byrd, will be the ultimate gatekeeper of the fighters' health and safety. They expressed confidence that if one fighter is not fighting to his best abilities, the bout will be stopped quickly.\n\n\"We always pride ourselves on stopping the fight one punch too soon, rather than one punch too late,\" Marnell said.\n\nReps for Mayweather and McGregor testified before the ruling that there were no health and safety concerns from the fighters. UFC attorney Hunter Campbell said they have agreed to wear American-style gloves that distribute the gloves' padding to the fists rather than the \"punchers-style\" horsehair gloves made in Mexico.\n\nFor more on \"The Money Fight: Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor,\" check out the MMA Rumors section of the site.\n\nJul 13, 2017; Brooklyn, NY, USA; during a world tour press conference to promote the upcoming Mayweather vs McGregor boxing fight at Barclays Center.

With his superfight against Conor McGregor a little over a week away, Floyd Mayweather struck a reflective tone on Thursday as he discussed the risk of coming out of retirement for a massive payday.\n\nMayweather, who has not fought in nearly two years, needs a win next week to surpass Rocky Marciano's record and reach 50-0 for his career, while McGregor, who is making his professional boxing debut, is 21-3 in mixed martial arts.\n\n\"When a fighter has lost before, if he loses again they say 'oh, it's nothing, he's lost before,'\" Mayweather told a conference call. \"But when a fighter has been dominating for 20-some years and never lost, everything is on the line. My legacy. My boxing record. Everything is on the line.\"\n\nThe fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite scepticism about how competitive it will be. Mayweather, a master defensive technician and tactician, is heavily favoured to win the Aug. 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said that, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.\n\nMayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather. \"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago. Of course not,\" he said. \"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago. I'm, not even the same Floyd Mayweather that I was I was five or two years ago.\n\n\"But I still have a high IQ in that ring. And experience wise, it leans towards me, period, because I have been in the ring at such a high level for so long.\"\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9815788", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "'It's worth it', Mayweather on putting legacy on the line - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60112471/60112471.jpg?58797", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1253, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1260}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mass media"}, "id": "304234", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Rocky Marciano"}, "id": "521934", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Marciano"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "03:29:00"}

The bout pits the biggest draw in boxing against the absolute hottest ticket in mixed martial arts. Both men are experts in their craft, and brilliant showmen and promoters in their own right. They have become household names by galvanizing fanbases in ways very few fighters have ever been able to do and the collision between the two is expected to do historical numbers. Why then, does it feel as if there are now tentative expectations as the super fight draws closer?\n\nFirst, the reports of ticket sales doing poorly are a sign that promoters overestimated the market. Prices are astronomical, even by blockbuster fight standards. By comparison, the hotly anticipated boxing match-up between Canelo Alvarez and \"Triple G\" Gennady Golovkin has been sold out almost since the tickets went on sale. Before conclusions are jumped to, it should be noted that prices for Canelo/GGG are far lower than those for Mayweather/McGregor.\n\nMayweather promoter Leonard Ellerbe has stated that sales are doing well, and adjusting for inflation they most likely are. Ticket prices are significantly higher. As such, the super fight does not need to sell nearly as many tickets in order to surpass the gate of Canelo/GGG.\n\nThis does not change the fact that increasing reports do not bode well for a sold out T-Mobile Arena. There are still hundreds of seats available with the fight now two weeks away. More recently, the re-sale market has spiked indicating that demand to go to the fight in person is lower than anticipated. On another note, reports that tickets are now available at Costco feel more like a prank than a way to boost sales. Simply put: if the fight was sold out, would there even be a chance that tickets found their way to Costco regardless of whether that was the plan or not?\n\nThe $100 dollar tag for the pay-per-view has many fans balking at the price. The previous $100 super fight between Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao left many fans feeling cheated as the bout failed to please fans. That fight was between two of the best boxers of a generation. McGregor may yet become an all-time great mixed martial artist, but it does not change the fact that he is 0-0 as a boxer taking on the man many believe is the best of his era. Getting fans to cough up that price again with less of a guarantee of fireworks is going to be a tough sell, even if the salesman is \"The Notorious.\"\n\nEven Mayweather has seen the need to address the issue, speaking to ESPN in an exclusive interview in which he states he will push the action against McGregor to make it an exciting fight. He even states that he feels the obligation to do so for those who criticized the Pacquiao fight.\n\nIn the last week, promotion has hit more of a frenzy. The dissolution of the partnership between McGregor and former two-weight champion Paul Malignaggi has led to the now exaggeratedly discussed video of the apparent knockdown. While the story has played out like a reality show, it has all been in favor of McGregor. Fans and professionals alike are declaring the exchange in question a knockdown, which boils down to more faith in McGregor's boxing skills at the end of the day.\n\nFinally, the undercard has been released for the super card. Unlike the bout with Pacquiao which featured only two other televised fights beside the main event, this card features several matches involving several of the top up-and-coming stars in boxing. While fans will certainly appreciate more boxing for their hard earned money, it is yet to be seen what impact it will have when it comes time to buy the fight.\n\nThe final factor may well be timing. The UFC is coming off an incredible July in which they put on their annual Independence Day weekend event and the stacked UFC 214 super card. Just three weeks after Mayweather vs McGregor will be Canelo vs Golovkin. With mixed expectations for McGregor's boxing debut, will fans have decided to invest their money on a safer event by the time the summer is over?\n\nThe fight has been projected to do historic numbers, breaking the Mayweather vs Pacquiao record and setting a new precedent for what a constitutes a super fight in the modern era. The question will be, can McGregor inspire enough confidence to get fans to shell out that much money for PPV? It is far easier to have faith that \"The Notorious\" will find a way to catch the boxing legend with a powerful shot than to think that Mayweather will miss a step for the first time in 50 fights. If there is any fighter who can inspire that kind of belief in a fan base to spend that much money, it is McGregor. Will he be able to get a historic number of fans to tune in, however, is the real question.", "id": "9525705", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Will Mayweather vs. McGregor Be Able to Break Records?", "image": "https://cagesidepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Mayweather-mcgregor.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Price"}, "id": "303074", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inflation"}, "id": "303276", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reality television"}, "id": "303533", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Money"}, "id": "303547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cough"}, "id": "303805", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}, "id": "304692", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "id": "305867", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "id": "332492", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Costco"}, "id": "333093", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez"}, "id": "361148", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa\u00fal_\u00c1lvarez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gennady Golovkin"}, "id": "384849", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Golovkin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 69, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 169, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1049, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1157, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Furry", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Furry"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "16:03:00"}

Referee - Hall of famer Robert Byrd. Judges - Burt Clements. Dave Morreti and Guido Cavalerri. 8oz gloves approved, with pre and post fight analysis of the gloves on the night.\n\n\"This was handled very well and very fairly by the NSAC. I am very pleased and respect the commissions ruling on this. Ten days until fight time.\"\n\nCommenting also on the announcement that Robert Byrd will be in the ring to referee the hotly anticipated clash, McGregor was as respectful as he has ever been ahead of his first professional outing in the ring.\n\nWith the smaller glove now confirmed, McGregor will now be looking to make good on his revised prediction during his open workout session. There, he insisted that should they go for the smaller gloves, he would then take care of business inside two rounds.\n\n\"If we're eight ounces, I'm struggling to give him two rounds, and that's the God's honest truth.\n\n\"The only reason I maybe give him two rounds is because in this game the referee stops me from pounding his head into the canvas, and he has 10 seconds to recover.\n\n\"That's the only reason why he might get to the second round.\"\n\nThis is certainly a bold assertion from the Irishman as he is aiming to become the first man ever to defeat Mayweather as a professional. With a record of 49 - 0 and bringing perhaps the greatest defence boxing has ever seen, the UFC lightweight champion certainly has his work cut out for him.\n\nHowever, for those who have followed McGregor's meteoric rise within the world of MMA, they will know that to doubt him is to be made a fool of.\n\nThe stage is now set for the greatest sporting spectacle of the year and we only have to wait another ten days.", "id": "9597584", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Conor McGregor Issues Statement Following 8-Ounce Glove Ruling By The NSAC", "image": "http://www.punditarena.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Conor-McGregor-Scrum.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}, "id": "304210", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ounce"}, "id": "307952", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glove"}, "id": "310512", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Weight class"}, "id": "385813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 290, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 712, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "18:22:00"}

Everything is on the line.\"\n\nThe fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite scepticism about how competitive it will be.\n\nMayweather, a master defensive technician and tactician, is heavily favoured to win the Aug. 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said that, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.\n\nMayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago. Of course not,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago.

In fact, the undefeated five-division champion noticed McGregor fouling more than anything as the Irish southpaw prepared for their August 26 showdown at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I had a chance to see it and my thoughts is I think it was real interesting, but a lot of rabbit punching, a lot of illegal rabbit punches behind the head,\" Mayweather said during a conference call Thursday. \"A lot of shots was illegal. A lot of grappling, a lot of wrestling and a lot of illegal shots. I mean, that's just my honest opinion.\n\n\"But I think I'm pretty sure the referee's gonna be fair on both sides. I want the referee [Robert Byrd] to be fair and treat both competitors, myself and Conor McGregor, treat us both - be even and treat us fair. And I just wanna have a good, solid fight.\"\n\nMayweather was noncommittal when asked about the much-discussed knockdown McGregor counted and Malignaggi contends was caused by a push and a trip.\n\n\"Some may call it a knockdown, some may not call it a knockdown,\" Mayweather said. \"At the end of the day, it only counts once you get under those lights. That's just the gym.\"\n\nRegardless, Mayweather won't base much about McGregor from those sparring sessions because the retired Malignaggi was far from peak physical condition when he traveled to Las Vegas to spar with McGregor.\n\n\"We're sitting here judging Paulie,\" Mayweather said, \"a guy that's been retired and commentating and traveling the world and not going to the gym at all, just going in there with a guy, an athlete, period, who's working out just every day, every day. And honestly, it shouldn't have even went 12 rounds with a young guy that's active.\"\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

Part of me is hoping maybe he can last so I can show some skill and dismantle him that way.\n\n\"But I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first few rounds.\"\n\nThe charismatic 29-year-old said a grueling training camp has taken him to \"hell and back\" and left him ready to face any kind of scenario inside the ring at the T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I'm not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"We are ready for both scenarios. I'm ready to go to war for 12 rounds and I'm ready to put him away early on.\"\n\nUlimtate Fighting Championship President Dana White also believes the gloves switch could shape the outcome of the fight.\n\n'HITS LIKE A TRUCK'\n\nThe move is widely seen as benefiting both fighters -- Mayweather's fast hands could be quicker with lighter gloves, while McGregor will be able to make his punching power more keenly felt, provided he can land a blow on his American opponent.\n\n\"I think it affects the contest a lot,\" White said when asked if McGregor would be helped by the change.\n\n\"Yes, Floyd will be faster with eight-ounce gloves but he's more defensive. Conor hits like a truck, so smaller gloves helps him big time. I think it absolutely does.\"\n\nMcGregor and Mayweather will climb into the ring following an international publicity tour last month marked by expletive-laden tirades and trash-talking.\n\nMcGregor, who was criticized for addressing Mayweather as \"boy\" during one event, dismissed suggestions that there was a racially tinged dimension to the duel.\n\n\"For me, it's athlete versus athlete,\" McGregor said. \"I'm disappointed to hear the way it's being portrayed. All I can do is stay focused on my craft and go out and put a performance for my fans.\"\n\nMcGregor, meanwhile, said he has used disparagement by the boxing community as motivation.\n\n\"It has certainly been motivating, the disrespect and the disregard for my skill set,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"I look at people so many times and their mind is closed to how things can be done.

Mayweather is regarded as one of the greatest defensive boxers of all-time and has never been beaten in his storied 21-year career, while McGregor has never boxed professionally.\n\nPundits and fans seem united in the belief that McGregor's only chance of winning is by way of knockout early into the fight, but the confident Irishman has said he is more interested in winning on points in a result that would send shockwaves around the world.\n\nRead more Explained: Why Mayweather wanted to fight McGregor in 8oz gloves\n\n\"Now the gloves are 8oz, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round,\" McGregor said in a conference call on Wednesday.\n\n\"(But) part of me is hoping that maybe he can last... part of me wants to show some skill and to dismantle him.

Cleverly, meanwhile, will be defending his title for the first time since wrestling it off Juergen Braehmer in October 2016.\n\nAnd with many predicting a one-sided contest between Mayweather and McGregor, the Welshman is confident he and Jack can steal the show.\n\n'It's one of these once in a blue moon fantasy fights, Mayweather-McGregor. It's captured the public's imagination,' he said.\n\n'As chief support you have a real, real fight between me and Jack, two genuine world class operators putting it on the line. This could be the real fight of the night, I'm looking to capitalise on that,' he added\n\n'It's a bonus that this fight is part of this show, the way it has all worked out it is a tremendous opportunity.'\n\nJack, who fights under the banner of Mayweather promotions, rose to the top of the 168lb division by beating the likes of Britain's George Groves before his pulsating draw with DeGale.\n\nCleverly will be making his first defence of the world title he won by beating Juergen Braehmer\n\nJack, 33, rose to the top of the 168lb division with wins over the likes of George Groves\n\nCleverly revealed, however, that he has not turned to his compatriots for advice, claiming: 'Regardless of any advice or what anyone tells me, it's down to me.'\n\nAnd though his clash with with Jack will play second-fiddle to Mayweather-McGregor on the night, the 30-year-old admits that no other fight has provided him such a platform to break into the elite level of the sport.\n\n'Every fight is big because each fight is important in its own right,' Cleverly said.\n\n'(But) on an exposure level...this fight is exceptionally important and (in) helping me break through to elite level, it is the most important fight.'\n\nCleverly is confident that he will emerge victorious at the T-Mobile Arena and the Welshman is in little doubt, too, that fellow boxer Mayweather will beat McGregor in the night's headline fight.\n\nAnd though he admits that the Irishman does not 'deserve' a shot at the biggest name in boxing, he paid tribute to the two fighters for putting themselves in a position to cash in on this 'one-off' event.\n\nCleverly fully expects Mayweather to beat McGregor. 'He's too good,' the 30-year-old said\n\nThe Welshman also claimed that the Irish UFC star does not 'deserve' to fight Mayweather\n\n'I don't believe there is any way of an upset, I believe Mayweather is too good, he has perfected his art and craft meticulously, he's too good to allow someone like McGregor to capitalise,' Cleverly said.\n\n'But in regards to McGregor making the fight happen, well done to the guy and best of luck to them because to make it happen they have to put themselves in that position and to put themselves in that position takes a lot of hard work, years of work.\n\n'Mayweather is rightfully so in that pinnacle position of boxing - he deserves it - and McGregor is in that pinnacle position of UFC fighting. Does he deserve the opportunity in boxing? No. But can you blame him for making it happen and combining with Mayweather to make it happen? No you can't blame him.\n\n'Fair play to the guys for the work they put in the gym and outside the gym for capturing the public's imagination and making this a one-off freak event.'\n\nSky Sports Box Office will show Mayweather v McGregor exclusively live on 26 August.

So sit back, relax and get yourself ready for the fun.\n\n0: In case you're unaware, it's the number of times McGregor, on the verge of facing a consensus all-time great, has stepped into a ring for an officially sanctioned amateur or professional boxing match. He has, however, had 24 mixed martial arts matches, winning 21 and scoring 18 stoppages.\n\n5: Number of professional weight classes in which Mayweather, who began punching for pay at age 19, has won sanctioned world championships. He earned his first belt, at 130 pounds, in 1998, and has since added jewelry at 135 (2002), 140 (2005), 147 (2006) and 154 (2007).\n\n50-0: The pro record Mayweather would reach with a win, eclipsing the 49-0 mark established by heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano between 1947 and 1955. No other widely recognized world champion has retired with a better record with zero losses and zero draws.\n\nTMT50 and TBE50: The trademarks applied for by Mayweather Productions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, per ESPN.com. TMT is short for \"The Money Team,\" while TBE stands for \"The Best Ever.\"\n\n19.5 million: The number of buys Mayweather has helped generate as a pay-per-view fighter, including the three most-purchased bouts in history -- 2.4 million against Oscar De La Hoya in 2007, 2.2 million against Canelo Alvarez in 2013 and 4.6 million against Manny Pacquiao in 2015.\n\n$600 million: The total projected gross revenue for the bout, according to ESPN's Darren Rovell, which would place it second only to the aforementioned Mayweather-Pacquiao show two years ago.\n\n$235: The proceeds of the public assistance check cashed by McGregor, according to Yahoo Sports, shortly before his UFC debut in 2013.\n\n$4.8 million: The price tag for the rare luxury car, a Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita, that Mayweather added to his collection in 2015, per Rolling Stone. The magazine said the ride maxes out at 254 mph and goes from 0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds.\n\n154 pounds: The agreed-upon weight for the Aug. 26 fight. Mayweather, most recently a full-time welterweight, has previously ventured into the junior middleweight for defeats of De La Hoya, Alvarez and Miguel Cotto. His heaviest weigh-in number was 151 pounds against Cotto. McGregor, meanwhile, fought at a 170-pound limit for a stoppage loss against substitute opponent Nate Diaz in 2016.\n\n11, 1 and 2: The chronological and statutory advantages -- in age (29 to Mayweather's 40), height (5'9\" to Mayweather's 5'8\") and reach (74 inches to Mayweather's 72) -- that McGregor will have when he enters the T-Mobile Arena.\n\n2,170 days: The length of time, come fight night, that will have elapsed since Mayweather last scored an inside-the-distance victory, via fourth-round KO against Victor Ortiz.\n\n13 seconds: The amount of time it took McGregor to stop Jose Aldo for his signature UFC win, capturing the organization's featherweight (145 pounds) championship in December 2015. He's since picked up the UFC lightweight (155 pounds) belt as well.\n\n22 seconds: Duration of the sparring video released by the UFC showing McGregor working with former two-division world champion Paulie Malignaggi. Malignaggi has since left the McGregor camp and claimed on social media that the clip, including what McGregor labeled a knockdown, wasn't at all representative of the 36 total minutes of sparring.\n\n$150: The wager, according to OddsShark, required to make a $100 profit on a Mayweather victory against McGregor inside the 12-round distance. A Mayweather win by decision, incidentally, would yield $230 for a $100 bet.\n\n$325: The profit available for a $100 bet on McGregor, again according to OddsShark, in the event the Irishman pulls off the upset. For comparison's sake, that profit number was at $950 when the fight was first rumored last fall.", "id": "9637446", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor: Inside the Numbers Around Megafight", "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/688/939/hi-res-94aac1ea81a44fb55a6d63f12f8b318f_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 356, "amb": false, "textEnd": 363, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}, {"textStart": 3470, "date": "2015-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3483}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}, "id": "302655", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "id": "305867", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "id": "310320", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Light middleweight"}, "id": "315817", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_middleweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}, "id": "315824", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}, "id": "327676", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}, "id": "333008", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

There's no guarantee that he will step up his training at this point, because it's clear that he will prepare in the manner that he sees fit and doesn't care what others think.\n\n\"I am going to do exactly what I want to do,\" Mayweather said in a previous episode. \"Nobody is going to tell me what to do.\"\n\nThe ongoing saga between McGregor and Showtime boxing analyst Paulie Malignaggi is likely to play out further. In each of the last two episodes, McGregor and Malignaggi have sparred to help the UFC lightweight champ prepare for Mayweather. The Showtime cameras were turned off for the sparring sessions, but McGregor has said he has gotten the best of the former fighter.\n\nMcGregor claimed in an interview with MMA Fighting's Ariel Helwani that his most recent sparring session was a 12-round fight and that he won each round. Malignaggi has dismissed the claim on The MMA Hour podcast and has asked for the tape for all 12 rounds to be released.\n\nWhile that has not happened, a small snippet of Malignaggi going down to the canvas has found its way to the public. Even that is controversial, because Malignaggi says that his tumble is the result of a shove and not a punch.\n\nIn any event, it is clear that McGregor has used his time to train in a much more serious manner than Mayweather. He knows he has a huge opportunity coming up in a little over a week, and he is trying to prepare as best he can for the first official boxing match of his career.\n\nMayweather is taking his 49-0 record into the ring, and while he has not competed in two years, his defensive skills are not likely to have waned. While he may not be as quick as he was in his prime, it's difficult to conceive of McGregor gaining enough skill to challenge him successfully.\n\nThe countdown to the megafight is starting to reach the critical stage.", "id": "9740044", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Mayweather vs. McGregor: TV Schedule, Preview for Showtime 'All Access' Episode", "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/689/606/hi-res-074b2031d376f200d649ea5a874e27c8_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 356, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 365}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "id": "304754", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Podcast"}, "id": "311311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strip club"}, "id": "312518", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_club"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gentlemen's club"}, "id": "313711", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen's_club"}, {"label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}, "id": "314692", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}, "id": "347122", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ariel Helwani"}, "id": "534814", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Helwani"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 19, "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 183, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 184, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Education/Commercial Services", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Education/Commercial_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 683, "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education and Training", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education_and_Training"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 733, "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Business Development", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Business_Development"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "09:24:00"}

The boxing great said that he doesn't believe this will be the case, as he plans on fighting differently come fight night.\n\n\"He's going to land shots, because with this fight I'm going straight ahead,\" Mayweather told Jimmy Kimmel. \"Normally, it's more taking my time, being very cautious, but this time I'm going straight ahead.\"\n\nWhen Kimmel asked why he'd risk probably \"making it more even,\" Mayweather says it's just to make the fight more entertaining.\n\n\"The fans deserve it.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Floyd and his team have hinted at fighting differently and trying to finish the fight early. His trainer recently stated that they don't think McGregor can last very long, so they plan to attack, \"turn the gas on\" and fight at a very high rate early.\n\nWith his vast experience and skillset over a first time pro-boxer, it's certainly not inconceivable for Floyd to win even with different approaches. But it just seems like switching to an aggressive start instead of his measured and defensive style could unnecessarily play to McGregor's pressure and counter game.\n\nThat being said, Floyd always says things to build up fights, so I guess we'll find out on the 26th how true these claims are.", "id": "9664290", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Floyd: Conor will land shots because I'll be really aggressive", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PYPWwz96X0Y9gK-jbJpgRxlm74Y=/0x0:3000x1688/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56232773/829624148.0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}, "id": "308118", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"}, "id": "308120", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Max Kellerman"}, "id": "389720", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kellerman"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 69, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 74, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "10:00:00"}

I use it as motivation and I look forward to going in and educating the world on what martial arts is.\"\n\nWhat follows May-Mac?\n\nMcGregor's future beyond his boxing debut has been queried by MMA fans who fear he may not be motivated to return to UFC after earning a reported $100m in facing Mayweather.\n\nHe addressed several potential career avenues during the conference call and contests he is still a current multiple-weight UFC champion despite vacating his featherweight belt in November.\n\n\"The current featherweight champion is Max Holloway, a man I dismantled,\" added McGregor.\n\n\"Everyone knows, I am the multiple world champion. I look forward to going back and continuing where I left off.\"\n\nMcGregor said Mayweather would get his \"respect\" if he followed through on comments made on a US talk show this week in which he said the pair could rematch under MMA rules.\n\nPaulie Malignaggi - who quit as McGregor's sparring partner after reacting angrily to images appearing to show him knocked down in a session - has also raised the prospect of coming out of retirement to box the Irishman.\n\n\"Tell him to shut his mouth and join the queue,\" McGregor said when asked about facing the former two-weight world champion.\n\n\"He got whooped and went sprinting.

Part of me is hoping maybe he can last so I can show some skill and dismantle him that way.\n\n\"But I do not see him absorbing the blows in the first few rounds.\"\n\nThe charismatic 29-year-old said a grueling training camp has taken him to \"hell and back\" and left him ready to face any kind of scenario inside the ring at the T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\"There is no way in hell that I'm not ready to fight in the deepest of trenches in this contest,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"We are ready for both scenarios. I'm ready to go to war for 12 rounds and I'm ready to put him away early on.\"\n\nUlimtate Fighting Championship President Dana White also believes the gloves switch could shape the outcome of the fight.\n\n- 'Hits like a truck' -\n\nThe move is widely seen as benefiting both fighters -- Mayweather's fast hands could be quicker with lighter gloves, while McGregor will be able to make his punching power more keenly felt, provided he can land a blow on his American opponent.\n\n\"I think it affects the contest a lot,\" White said when asked if McGregor would be helped by the change.\n\n\"Yes, Floyd will be faster with eight-ounce gloves but he's more defensive. Conor hits like a truck, so smaller gloves helps him big time. I think it absolutely does.\"\n\nMcGregor and Mayweather will climb into the ring following an international publicity tour last month marked by expletive-laden tirades and trash-talking.\n\nMcGregor, who was criticized for addressing Mayweather as \"boy\" during one event, dismissed suggestions that there was a racially tinged dimension to the duel.\n\n\"For me, it's athlete versus athlete,\" McGregor said. \"I'm disappointed to hear the way it's being portrayed. All I can do is stay focused on my craft and go out and put a performance for my fans.\"\n\nMcGregor, meanwhile, said he has used disparagement by the boxing community as motivation.\n\n\"It has certainly been motivating, the disrespect and the disregard for my skill set,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"I look at people so many times and their mind is closed to how things can be done. It's a set way and there is no other way. Well, if that was the case we would have never reached across the oceans in search of other lands. We would never have gone into space.\n\n\"You have to have an open mind and you got to realize that there are other ways. Fighting is a complex game.

That fight included two of the biggest names in boxing and finally brought together two fighters the fans had been dying to see face each other in the ring for years. McGregor comes from a different sport and has a massive fan base, so when you combine his drawing power in MMA with Floyd's in boxing, it's no surprise that this thing could do five million buys.\n\nThe fight also received an interesting twist on Wednesday when the Nevada Athletic Commission voted unanimously to allow the two men to box in 8-ounce gloves.\n\nThe state's typical rules necessitate 10-ounce gloves for fights taking place at 147 pounds or above. Mayweather and McGregor are fighting at a weight limit of 154 pounds, but they petitioned the commission for a waiver to allow them to fight with the 8-ounce gloves. The commission approved the one-time waiver via a 5-0 vote on Wednesday.\n\nFinancial terms of the fight have not been disclosed.

My boxing record. Everything is on the line.\"\n\nThe fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite scepticism about how competitive it will be.\n\nMayweather, a master defensive technician and tactician, is heavily favoured to win the Aug. 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said that, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.\n\nMayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago.

My boxing record. Everything is on the line.\"\n\nThe fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite scepticism about how competitive it will be.\n\nMayweather, a master defensive technician and tactician, is heavily favoured to win the August 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.\n\nMayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago.

(Source: AP) Game of Thrones season 7's latest episode has got Twitterati excited for more reasons than oneAishwarya Rai Bachchan steals a million hearts in this white Manish Malhotra suit at IFFMWATCH: Groom enters wedding in a TRACTOR! That's desi swag in Canada\n\nWith his superfight against Conor McGregor a little over a week away, Floyd Mayweather struck a reflective tone on Thursday as he discussed the risk of coming out of retirement for a massive payday.\n\nMayweather, who has not fought in nearly two years, needs a win next week to surpass Rocky Marciano's record and reach 50-0 for his career, while McGregor, who is making his professional boxing debut, is 21-3 in mixed martial arts.\n\n\"When a fighter has lost before, if he loses again they say 'oh, it's nothing, he's lost before,'\" Mayweather told a conference call. \"But when a fighter has been dominating for 20-some years and never lost, everything is on the line.\n\n\"My legacy. My boxing record. Everything is on the line.\" The fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite skepticism about how competitive it will be.\n\nMayweather, a master defensive technician, and tactician is heavily favoured to win the Aug. 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said that, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.\n\nMayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago. Of course not,\" he said. \"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago. I'm, not even the same Floyd Mayweather that I was I was five or two years ago.\n\n\"But I still have a high IQ in that ring.

The McGregor who spoke to the media on a Wednesday call was polite, smart...and actually somewhat likable. Incredible, I know, but true. While it's a fact the smack talk of lore was still evident (\"I don't not see him absorbing the blows in the first few rounds...I'm ready to put him away in the first ten seconds\") the McGregor of Wednesday was most distinctly not the same man seen strutting about the outrageous press tour of several weeks ago. With his August 26th megabout with Floyd Mayweather less than two weeks away, the McGregor of Wednesday came across often enough as thoughtful and at ease.\n\nPhoto Credit: USA Today\n\nWith that in mind, it was still clear McGregor is something of strange man. \"It is what it is,\" he said in regards to Bud Crawford and others making fun of his training methods online. \"It's lighthearted and I don't take it personal.\" Then, however, McGregor went on a tangent about why his way of doing things is legitimate, replete with some anger against his antagonists. There was little doubt, however, that McGregor is taking Mayweather seriously. \"It is what it is,\" he once again claimed (it was clearly a favorite phrase of his) of the fact that many in the boxing world are essentially writing him off. \"I use it as motivation...but, at the same time, I get it.\" McGregor went on to speak of \"earning my respect in this game (boxing) also.\"\n\nAs for training camp, the Irish UFC star made it clear he's feeling confident as fight week closes in. \"We've had one hell of a camp,\" he said, \"now we are closing in on the weight cutting phase.\" McGregor was also obviously aware of the differences between boxing and mixed martial arts, the sport which has made him famous. \"You've got to factor in there's not as much grappling,\" he said of boxing. \"We've stretched it (his preparation) out to accommodate the twelve three minute rounds.\" Things got a bit awkward when the New York Times acted the part of the New York Times by bringing up the race issue. \"It's give and take here,\" McGregor claimed in response to the accusation he can get away with things Mayweather can't. \"I've been given my fair share of hate and my fair share of love also.\"\n\nThere was, however, one particularly odd statement that came from McGregor's mouth, one that made this author take note. \"We are prepared,\" McGregor claimed, \"for every possible outcome.\" Was McGregor, the very picture of confidence, showing a bit of uncertainty - even unintentionally so? Or was it all just a slip of the tongue, an off way of putting things, something that might be misinterpreted?\n\nThat's something only that perhaps only Conor McGregor knows", "id": "9585680", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Conor McGregor Conference Call: \"We Are Prepared For Every Possible Outcome.\" | BoxingInsider.com", "image": "https://www.boxinginsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/USATSI_10212628_167725636_lowres.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 582, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 593}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}, "id": "303936", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"}, {"label": {"eng": "USA Today"}, "id": "304254", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grappling"}, "id": "325886", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Weight cutting"}, "id": "622243", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_cutting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Douglas McGregor"}, "id": "1222676", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McGregor"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "23:57:00"}

After his last fight, a 2015 decision defeat of Andre Berto, the boxing legend elected to hang up the gloves. Yet this lucrative crossover fight with McGregor was apparently enough to pull him back to the ring.\n\nWhat do you think of Justin Bieber's prediction for the big fight?", "id": "9830350", "details": {"gpCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Justin Bieber makes prediction for Mayweather-McGregor, Mayweather Sr. doesn't like it | BJPenn.com", "image": "http://www.bjpenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justin-Bieber.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}, "id": "302764", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber"}, {"label": {"eng": "Singing"}, "id": "302767", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pop music"}, "id": "303105", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "TMZ"}, "id": "304979", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}, "id": "307719", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "id": "310320", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}, "id": "347122", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andre Berto"}, "id": "390617", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Berto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}, "id": "418449", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Sr."}, "id": "606734", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Sr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 403, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain Names", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain_Names"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "15:14:00"}

That is just the beginning for Mayweather's plans, however.\n\nMayweather wants to open similar clubs around the world, focusing on areas where such facilities are least likely to exist due to economic or other logistical difficulties. The global strategy for Mayweather's fitness business includes more than just providing places to work out. Mayweather also plans to invade the training space as well.\n\nJust as Mayweather wants his fitness clubs to have a global presence, he intends to use technology to train individuals around the world. Forming exercise regimens which mimic his own, Mayweather will disseminate content in which he takes customers through the workouts using a mobile application and virtual reality tech.\n\nEntering the fitness industry is in and of itself an ambitious task. Not only is the business crowded, but there is very little which any single entity can claim as proprietary. In order to grab any market share, much less one the size that Mayweather is eyeing, it will take enormous resources and a strong brand identity.\n\nFortunately, Mayweather has a strong brand identity and enormous resources. On top of his status as a world-class athlete that is instantly recognizable, his estimated net worth sits at $340 million.\n\nThe brand and financial power of Mayweather will be even stronger after the fight with McGregor, especially if he claims victory. Mayweather stands to make at least $100 million but up to $400 million from the fight. That money can go a long way toward establishing Mayweather's mobile app, virtual reality content and fitness clubs.\n\nIf there ever was a time that would be appropriate for Mayweather to launch this business, right after sparring with McGregor seems to be it.", "id": "9861755", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Floyd Mayweather will capitalize on the moment to enter the fitness industry", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2017/08/645542500-floyd-mayweathers-40th-birthday-celebration-arrivals.jpg.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "227084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "USA Today"}, "id": "304254", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today"}, {"label": {"eng": "Physical exercise"}, "id": "305854", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 88, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Sporting Goods", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Sporting_Goods"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 196, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 263, "label": "dmoz/Business/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Business/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 267, "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 813, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 983, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1028, "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness"}], "time": "00:01:00"}

My boxing record. Everything is on the line.\"\n\nThe fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite scepticism about how competitive it will be.\n\nMayweather, a master defensive technician and tactician, is heavily favoured to win the Aug. 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said that, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.\n\nMayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago. Of course not,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago. I'm, not even the same Floyd Mayweather that I was I was five or two years ago.\n\n\"But I still have a high IQ in that ring. And experience wise, it leans towards me, period, because I have been in the ring at such a high level for so long.\"\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "id": "9802756", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Boxing-Mayweather on putting legacy on the line: 'It's worth it'", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1024, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1031}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Rocky Marciano"}, "id": "521934", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Marciano"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 954, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "01:02:00"}

However, it can be quite difficult discussing it with casual combat sports fans. As will be noted, these fans may not be properly informed about what is happening in the current state of combat sports. While technically nobody is currently incorrect in stating an opinion about this upcoming bout since it hasn't happened yet, you seem to get the same answers from fans who aren't dialed into, not only the current state, but also, the history of boxing, and Floyd Mayweather's career in general.\n\nFrom listening and engaging in conversations with these fans, we have chosen the top-9 most frequently used takes as it relates to the bout between Mayweather and McGregor.\n\nAnother choice that was taken into consideration is the trash-talking aspect between the two. Since we were able to see it play out during the four city, three country world tour, that aspect of this list has been omitted.\n\nThis is more of an educational guideline for the casual sports fan. We have assembled a panel of experts from multiple aspects of the fight world, which includes coaches, journalists, broadcasters, boxing and Mayweather enthusiasts, professional boxers, who have also made the transition to MMA, as well as active fighters in the UFC. The panel has been asked about each individual hot take and have responded to it as they see fit.\n\nHere is the panel:\n\nAna Julaton: Professional boxer (14-4, 1 draw), former WBO Super Bantamweight World Champion, IBA Super Bantamweight World Champion\n\nONE Championship women's flyweight (2-2)\n\nAngelo Reyes: Boxing Coach of former UFC heavyweight champion Frank Mir, and others since coming from the boxing world where he has developed world champions under the guidance of Freddie Roach.\n\nBlake Stephenson: Floyd Mayweather expert, Host of The Loaded Joe's MMA and LoudMouth Boxing podcasts\n\nHeather Hardy: Professional boxer (20-0), WBC International Female Flyweight Champion\n\nRay Flores: Ring announcer for Premier Boxing Champions, hosted the London, England stop of the Mayweather-McGregor world tour\n\nOn June 15, 2017, Max Kellerman and Stephen A. Smith debated the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor on ESPN's First Take. While Kellerman also stated that Mayweather would not fare well in the MMA world, he told the world that Conor McGregor \"had zero chance in this fight.\"\n\nWhat really made headlines was Kellerman stating that \"Conor McGregor will not land a single punch against Floyd Mayweather.\" Since Kellerman made that bold prediction, casual fans, when discussing this fight, have gone to what Kellerman said on ESPN back in June as a reason why Mayweather will defeat McGregor on Aug. 26.\n\nHere is how the panel responded to the No.9 casual fan hot take:\n\nAna Julaton: It doesn't happen in boxing. In boxing, you have to know that you're going to get hit. I mean it's just part of the game. Floyd's going to get hit and that's what makes him such a warrior. He knows he's going to get hit. He just knows exactly who he is. He knows what his strengths are, what his weaknesses are, and with that, he knows how to disarm his opponents.\n\nI don't necessarily agree with Max Kellerman 100 percent. I don't know if he has practiced boxing, but getting into a live fight where you don't have the face mask, you're going up against time and you get someone who's trained to just take your head off, it's different. It's a different arena altogether. So yeah, it's going to be a fight. Floyd himself said that he's expecting Conor to just come right at him.\n\nAngelo Reyes: I disagree. I do believe that Floyd will dominate him. I know where Max Kellerman was coming from, and Max is great. I have nothing bad to say about Max. I think what Max was trying to explain was, he doesn't believe Conor will land a significant punch. George Foreman has said this in the past, the better the boxing match is, the less people will actually appreciate it. It's like an art piece. When you look at a piece of art, and let's say it's worth a million dollars, if you're not in the art world and understand the artistry of it, you won't understand why it's worth a million dollars. I think this is Max Kellerman saying to himself, as an artist in this world of boxing, I can't possibly see Conor McGregor understanding this boxing painting. That's what he meant when he said he won't land a single punch against Floyd. Of course, he's trying to get the headline, but I understand what he's actually saying.\n\nManny Pacquiao is amazing, he's a legend. If he had a hard time catching up to Floyd, then how can Conor, who's never boxed in a professional setting, have an easier time doing it to Floyd?\n\nBlake Stephenson: Exaggeration without thought. That's why he went back on it and was like, \"yeah he will land, but not much.\"\n\nHeather Hardy: OK, I don't think that's true. I think that he won't punch a lot, but I do believe that he's going to be a little bit awkward and it might take Mayweather a round or so to adjust. Not that I don't fully believe that Mayweather will adjust, but I do think it might take him a punch or two.\n\nJose Youngs: Foolish. That's the only way to describe Kellerman's comments. Now don't get me wrong, I firmly believe Kellerman is one of, if the not the best boxing commentators in the business. But saying McGregor will land ZERO punches after 12-rounds of action is a little absurd. Honestly, I doubt Kellerman even believes this.\n\nNot taking into account McGregor could trip and accidentally punch Mayweather, the Irishman's longer reach and accuracy will undoubtedly lead to a bruise or two plastered across his opponent's face.\n\nIs Mayweather the greatest defensive boxers of our lifetime? Yes. Will he avoid over 100 punches in 12 rounds? Probably not. Does landing a handful of punches mean McGregor will win? Absolutely not.\n\nSorry Max.\n\nRay Flores: I don't think that's the case. I think that he is going to be able to connect at least once and Conor better make that punch count because that's the only time he is going to touch Floyd. At some point over the first three or four rounds, Conor, just based on the size, his explosiveness and his athletic abilities, will find a way to connect against Floyd. He better make that shot count.\n\nShane Burgos: He will definitely land a single punch. Most definitely land at least one punch, it's almost impossible for him not to land a punch. At least a body shot, I mean the head is a little harder to hit because Floyd is really good at moving the head. C'mon, let's be real now. He's going to land a shot, more than one. He said it like he is dead serious too. If that actually happens, props to that guy.\n\nZak Ottow: I can see rounds where he may not land anything clean, but I see this fight going for several rounds. Over the course of several rounds, I wouldn't be surprised if McGregor lands some clean shots, just because of the mirrored stance that they like to be in, and the fact that Mayweather does like to burst out with those quick cross darts, and I think McGregor can fade out on those and try to bang that left hand, like he likes to do. To say he won't land anything the whole fight, I don't agree with that.", "id": "9740039", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor: A beginner's guide to hot takes", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2017/08/813546126-floyd-mayweather-jr-v-conor-mcgregor-world-press-tour-toronto.jpg.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 19, "amb": false, "textEnd": 26, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}, {"textStart": 2300, "date": "2017-06-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2313}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}, "id": "310322", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}, "id": "310326", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}, "id": "315824", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flyweight"}, "id": "321602", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trash-talk"}, "id": "325883", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash-talk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}, "id": "350921", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Foreman"}, "id": "364363", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Foreman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Max Kellerman"}, "id": "389720", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kellerman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

The line in Vegas is that the over/under is 4.9m. Everything is tracking right now to say that we're going to kill this thing. It's looking really good.\"\n\nAlthough Mayweather has been used to generating hundreds of millions of dollars from a single fight, this is new territory for White and McGregor - the previous pay-per-view sales record was 1.65m for the Irishman's rematch with Nate Diaz last year.\n\nThat fight marked McGregor's biggest payday to date, pocketing him $3m.

He makes sure that the unified rules of boxing are complied with. He's intimately familiar with the rules. He is an inductee into the Hall of Fame.\n\n\"An example I can give you is from the first Andre Ward v Sergey Kovalev fight. In the pre-fight instructions he explained the rules to perfection. He listened to the concerns of each fighter. The concerns of each fighter came to fruition during the fight, and he immediately addressed it.\n\n\"He's a no-nonsense referee inside the ring who takes control. He's always in an excellent position.\n\n\"There were no complaints from either camp.\"\n\nThe only request regarding officials to the NSAC was McGregor asking for an international judge, which Sky Sports reported last week. The request was approved by including Italy's Guido Cavalleri.\n\n\"Otherwise I would have used an out-of-state judge,\" Bennett said. \"Mr. Cavalleri has travelled the world, from Japan to Madison Square Garden, and performed exceptionally.\"\n\nThe NSAC also changed their own rules to allow Mayweather and McGregor to wear 8oz gloves, rather than the 10oz gloves that were previously mandatory in the 154lbs division.\n\nBennett explained: \"Conor is used to fighting in 4oz gloves. Floyd typically fights in 8oz gloves with three exceptions - 'Canelo', Miguel Cotto and Oscar De La Hoya - because he usually fights at welterweight [147lbs].\n\n\"We evaluated our regulations and decided it was in the best interest of the fighters and the fans to deviate for one-time only.\n\n\"This is a one-time waiver with the caveat that the gloves must be inspected, which is standard procedure. The original pair must then be returned to the commission after the fight for our inspection.\"\n\nAsked about safety concerns with the smaller gloves, Bennett said: \"We initiated a study to see if there is a significant difference between 8oz and 10oz gloves.

Watch it live on SuperSport or, if you'd rather sleep in after a big Saturday night out, the fight will be up on Showmax by 3pm CAT.\n\nHe's not called Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather for nothing. The superstar boxer has been known to carry a million dollars in cash when he's out in public and openly flaunts it.\n\nLooking at what Mayweather earned when he fought Manny Pacquiao in 2015, we get an idea of how much the fight purse is. TV revenue alone was said to have passed $400-million, with Mayweather walking away with a cool $180-million from that fight alone.\n\nIf the pay-per-view revenue follows the trend of the Mayweather-Pacquiao bout, the winner of The Money Fight could walk away with about $250-million. And that's just insane.\n\nWhy this fight is so exciting\n\nMayweather has fought 49 professional boxing matches and won them all. McGregor has fought zero. At the bookies, his odds of winning are five to one and expectations are low.\n\nMcGregor is also a UFC fighter, meaning he is a mixed martial artist, whereas Mayweather is purely a boxer. So when McGregor steps into the ring (not the octagon) he's deep in Mayweather's territory. This is a clash of styles unlike anything seen before.\n\nThe hype around this fight has been bonkers. The fighters are getting extremely personal at the press briefings, and for our viewing pleasure the insults will keep on coming.\n\nHow much are the tickets?\n\nRingside seats will set you back $10,000 a pop (about R131,000), while the \"cheap seats\" are going for $500 each. Other ticket prices range from $1,500 to $7,500.\n\nAnd if you don't have several grand to spend on tickets, pay-per-view will cost $99.95 for high definition in the US.\n\nOn Showmax, you get to watch the fight at no extra cost, when you want to, on the same day it happens.", "id": "9848412", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "McGregor vs Mayweather: here's where to watch the big fight", "image": "http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/incoming/2017/08/17/showmax-native-content/ALTERNATES/crop200x150/Showmax+native+content", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 308, "date": "2017-08-27", "amb": false, "textEnd": 317}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}, "id": "302736", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television"}, "id": "302838", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Octagon"}, "id": "382893", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octagon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "SuperSport (South African TV channel)"}, "id": "1272422", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperSport_(South_African_TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "1278946", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr._vs._Manny_Pacquiao"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 482, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 553, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1049, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "08:08:00"}

But I don't see him absorbing the blows in the first two rounds.\"\n\nMcGregor was reminded that 46 of Mayweather's 49 fights have been contested in 8oz gloves, but the UFC champion said: \"That doesn't bother me. How often he's worn the gloves did not factor into my thoughts, I did not even know that. I do not care about his record, I do not care about his achievements.\"\n\nMcGregor also welcomed the confirmation of Robert Byrd as the referee, which the NSAC revealed on Wednesday.\n\n\"Robert Byrd is a phenomenal referee - I've watched him ref since the announcement was made,\" McGregor said. \"He lets the fight takes place, he doesn't interrupt, he steps in when he should. He has some links to mixed martial arts - his wife Adelaide Byrd is [a UFC judge].\n\n\"We were hoping for someone with links to MMA.\n\n\"They gave us options. We didn't necessarily ask for any referee in particular. There was a referee that gave an opinion which made it very hard for them to be considered.\n\n\"Tony Weeks was a consideration. He has reffed both MMA and boxing bouts so he was on our list - but we are happy with the selection.\"\n\nThe NSAC also selected Italy's Guido Cavalleri among the three ringside judges after accepting McGregor's request for one non-US representative. He said: \"I believe it's a fair mix across the board - there's Americans and a European.\"\n\nAsked about the critics of his boxing debut - which he labelled \"disrespect and disregard\" - McGregor remained combative, insisting he could end Mayweather's perfect career record.\n\n\"They have a closed mind,\" McGregor said. \"If that were always the case, we'd have never reached across the waters in search of other lands. We'd have never gone into space. You've got to have an open mind and realise that there are other ways.\n\n\"Fighting is a complex game - there is a time and a place for every attack, and every move.

I look forward to earning my respect in this game also.\"\n\nWatch Mayweather vs McGregor, from the T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, from midnight August 26, live on Sky Sports Box Office.

He is 21-3 as a pro mixed martial artist, and 0-0 as a pro boxer.\n\nMayweather, meanwhile, is a sparkling 49-0 as a pro boxer. After his last fight, a 2015 decision defeat of Andre Berto, the boxing legend elected to hang up the gloves. Yet this lucrative crossover fight with McGregor was evidently enough to pull him back to the ring.\n\nWhat do you think of the judge and referee choices for Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather?", "id": "9597598", "details": {"gpCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "BREAKING | Referee and judges announced for Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather | BJPenn.com", "image": "http://www.bjpenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Floyd-Mayweather-Conor-McGregor-4.png", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 172, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 181}, {"textStart": 752, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 767}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "id": "310320", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}, "id": "347122", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andre Berto"}, "id": "390617", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Berto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}, "id": "418449", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nevada Athletic Commission"}, "id": "424035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Athletic_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 128, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "15:22:00"}

To White, McGregor and his legion of fans, it shows the fighter's awesome power and knockdown ability.\n\nMcGregor KO's former champion\n\n0:18\n\n\"What they're doing is so adorable and so cute,\" Malignaggi told Yahoo Sports.\n\n\"They're trying all these sales tactics. His fan base is adorable and cute, because they're jumping all over it. Everything they say, they're jumping all over it. They're so happy to hear this news that he's supposedly doing great and the video shows this and that's how it is.\n\n\"I've never seen such a cult-like following to the point where people are in denial and where the fighter himself doesn't even believe in himself to that point he's putting out this fake stuff. He's afraid the real stuff won't convince anybody.\n\n\"This entire thing, he's like the little engine that could. He's like this adorable guy trying so hard to look like Hercules. He knows nobody believes in him and he's trying so hard to get people to believe and his minions are trying so hard that they believe anything he says. Dana is the little ringleader.\"\n\nMalignaggi reserved a sensational character assassination for White.\n\n\"Dana being the fake guy that he is, he tried to come up to me and say, 'Hey man, good work,'\" Malignaggi said. \"I just brushed him off because he's not somebody I like.\n\n\"I don't like the way he runs his business. I don't like the way he screws the fighters. I don't like the fact he's trying to prevent the Muhammad Ali Act from being included in mixed martial arts. I don't like him as a person. I don't like what he stands for and I don't like anything about him.\n\n\"So when he tried to talk to me after the sparring, I kind of brushed him off anyway. The fact he put out the video, I think he got a lot of pleasure out of that, the whole editing and putting it out, because he didn't like how I brushed him off to begin with.\"\n\nI'LL PAY YOUR BETS\n\nFloyd Mayweather Jr. is well known for outlaying ridiculous money on bets on everything: notably basketball and American football, both college and professional in both cases.\n\nBut next weekend, he's going to be betting on himself.\n\nDon't worry -- unlike in most of the world, where betting on your own fight or team would be a punishable offence -- it's perfectly legal in Las Vegas, Nevada, where the superfight is taking place.\n\nMayweather confirmed his betting plans in an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday.\n\nKimmel: Are you allowed to bet on yourself in this fight?\n\nMayweather: Yes\n\nKimmel: You are... and will you bet on yourself?\n\nMayweather: Yes.\n\nKimmel: You're not allowed to bet against yourself?\n\nMayweather: I'm never going to bet against myself, never.\n\nMayweather then doubled down, saying Kimmel could bet on him freely and without fear, such is his confidence in victory that the 40-year-old boldly claimed he'd cover any bets placed on him by the talk show host.\n\n\"It is worth it, whatever you bet -- if you don't win I will give it back to you. You've got my word,'' Mayweather said before shaking hands on the deal.\n\nI WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR GLOVES\n\nFrom their very first press conference, the debate over which gloves -- and, more specifically, what weight the gloves would be -- has been at the forefront of the baiting between the two fighters.\n\nAnd the fight, on that front at least, is over.\n\nMcGregor is used to fighting in the UFC with 4oz gloves, while typically in boxing heavier gloves are the norm.\n\nMcGregor got on the offensive early and set the tone for the debate, saying that Mayweather was afraid to fight with the lighter gloves.\n\nNot so, said Mr. 49-0 and they've reached an extraordinary agreement to ratify a late switch.\n\nWhite couldn't be happier at the news and believes it will give McGregor an instant advantage against the famously rock-solid Mayweather defence.\n\n\"It definitely benefits Conor,\" he told Sky Sports UK.\n\n\"First of all, Floyd isn't a big puncher, he's not a knockout puncher.\n\n\"His whole game is defence, using the gloves to defend himself, and smaller gloves means Conor will have more places to hit.\n\n\"Conor isn't concerned about Floyd's punching power at all.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is happy.\n\nThe move certainly didn't have the support of the Association of Ringside Physicians who on Wednesday released a statement categorically stating it doesn't support the push for smaller gloves.\n\n\"Unless there is scientific evidence to support the view that such a change might improve the safety of this bout, we would strongly caution against allowing current regulation to be overruled,\" said the Association's Chairman, Dr Raymond M. Monsell, in a letter to the Nevada State Athletic Commission.\n\n\"To do so would also set a precedent for future bouts.\"\n\nWhoa!

The line in Vegas is that the over/under is 4.9m. Everything is tracking right now to say that we're going to kill this thing. It's looking really good.\"\n\nAlthough Mayweather has been used to generating hundreds of millions of dollars from a single fight, this is new territory for White and McGregor - the previous pay-per-view sales record was 1.65m for the Irishman's rematch with Nate Diaz last year.\n\nThat fight marked McGregor's biggest payday to date, pocketing him $3m.

In the United Kingdom, it is expected that the fight will start between 4-5am on Sunday, August 27 morning.\n\n2) The fight will be a boxing event - not a UFC fight. All rules and regulations will be as they would be for any other professional boxing fight, meaning McGregor will not be allowed to use any of his usual mixed martial arts moves during the Mayweather fight.\n\n3) There is no title belt on the line. Winning this fight will mean much to both fighters and their fans than any title belt in either boxing or the UFC.\n\n4) At the present time, there is no contracted plans for a rematch in a UFC style fight. McGregor and Mayweather have both teased a follow-up battle in the octagon, but it is unlikely Mayweather will agree to a mixed martial arts fight.\n\nWith just a week left until the fight starts, here are some of the best locations in Chelmsford to watch 'The Notorious' Conor McGregor vs Floyd 'Money' Mayweather:\n\nOpening Times: Walkabout will open on Saturday at 11am and remain open all through the night until 6am on the Sunday morning. They will then close until 11am, which is when they'll open for their usual Sunday service.\n\nEntry Prices: Standard tickets for this event will be priced at \u00a310 per person. VIP packages are also available and start at \u00a350 per person. They are available by emailing sales.chelmsford@walkaboutbars.com or calling 01245 806533.\n\nOpening Times: Wheatsheaf will also be staying open until 6am - or 30 minutes after the fight finishes.\n\nEntry Prices: Entry at Wheatsheaf is completely FREE before midnight or \u00a35 if tickets are purchased in advance for after 12am. Ticket prices on the door will be \u00a310 and subject to availability.\n\nOpening Times: The Golden Fleece will stay open all night and will have a live band from 10pm, before a DJ takes over till 2.30am.

Referee - Hall of famer Robert Byrd.\n\n\"Judges - Burt Clements. Dave Morreti and Guido Cavalerri. 8oz gloves approved.

Conor hits like a truck, so smaller gloves helps him big time. I think it absolutely does.\"\n\nMcGregor and Mayweather will climb into the ring following an international publicity tour last month marked by expletive-laden tirades and trash-talking.\n\nMcGregor, who was criticized for addressing Mayweather as \"boy\" during one event, dismissed suggestions that there was a racially tinged dimension to the duel.\n\n\"For me, it's athlete versus athlete,\" McGregor said. \"I'm disappointed to hear the way it's being portrayed. All I can do is stay focused on my craft and go out and put a performance for my fans.\"\n\nMcGregor, meanwhile, said he has used disparagement by the boxing community as motivation.\n\n\"It has certainly been motivating, the disrespect and the disregard for my skill set,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"I look at people so many times and their mind is closed to how things can be done. It's a set way and there is no other way. Well, if that was the case we would have never reached across the oceans in search of other lands. We would never have gone into space.\n\n\"You have to have an open mind and you got to realize that there are other ways. Fighting is a complex game.

My boxing record. Everything is on the line.\"\n\nThe fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite scepticism about how competitive it will be.\n\nMayweather, a master defensive technician and tactician, is heavily favored to win the Aug. 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said that, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.\n\nMayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago. Of course not,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago. I'm, not even the same Floyd Mayweather that I was I was five or two years ago.\n\n\"But I still have a high IQ in that ring. And experience wise, it leans toward me, period, because I have been in the ring at such a high level for so long.\"\n\n(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Ian Ransom)\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

He had a four-round fight, a six-round fight, this...then after fifteen fights he was like 14-1, and then fought a contender - even if he lost to the contender, right? But at least he held his own over ten rounds, it usually takes about 5 or 6 years to build a guy like that out of the amateurs,\" he said. \"Then he would have a chance to win a round against someone half as good as Floyd Mayweather. But you're gonna turn pro after not being in a boxing ring competitively for how many years? And fight one of the best pure boxers of all time? It doesn't matter that he's (Floyd) 40 or whatever.

All I can do is stay focused on my craft and go out and put a performance for my fans.\"\n\nMcGregor, meanwhile, said he has used disparagement by the boxing community as motivation.\n\n\"It has certainly been motivating, the disrespect and the disregard for my skill set,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"I look at people so many times and their mind is closed to how things can be done. It's a set way and there is no other way. Well, if that was the case we would have never reached across the oceans in search of other lands.

Everything is on the line.\"\n\nThe fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite scepticism about how competitive it will be.\n\nMayweather, a master defensive technician and tactician, is heavily favoured to win the Aug. 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said that, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.\n\nMayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.\n\n\"I try not to think about losing or taking the 'L.' That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk. I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it's worth it.\"\n\nMayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago. Of course not,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago. I'm, not even the same Floyd Mayweather that I was I was five or two years ago.\n\n\"But I still have a high IQ in that ring. And experience wise, it leans towards me, period, because I have been in the ring at such a high level for so long.\" (Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Ian Ransom)", "id": "9802570", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Boxing-Mayweather on putting legacy on the line: 'It's worth it'", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 17, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 23}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1060, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1067}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Irish people"}, "id": "309111", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "International"}, "id": "360932", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rocky Marciano"}, "id": "521934", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Marciano"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 954, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "01:00:00"}

Cleverly will be making the first defence of WBA title but is the underdog heading into the fight, as Jack moves up a weight class following his majority draw with WBC super-middleweight champion James DeGale.\n\nJack may well be the favourite but, at 33, will need to get to grips with his new weight class quickly. And then there is the fact Jack has never been a hugely powerful puncher, not even at super-middleweight. He last stopped an opponent in 2014, while Cleverly - the bigger man - has only been knocked out once in his career, by Sergey Kovalev a year previous. It promises to be a true war.\n\nConor McGregor's most memorable quotes 15 show all Conor McGregor's most memorable quotes 1/15 McGregor on...\n\n... staying humble.\n\nGetty\n\n2/15 McGregor on...\n\n... how he chose to make an honest living.\n\nGetty Images\n\n3/15 McGregor on...\n\n... why he doesn't watch Britain's Got Talent.\n\nGetty Images\n\n4/15 McGregor on...\n\n... bums, and selflessly transforming their respective bum lives.\n\nGetty Images\n\n5/15 McGregor on...\n\n... the exceptionally dangerous solid gold pocket watch industry.

The former welterweight world champion knocked out Andre Berto - Mayweather's most recent opponent - in a world-title eliminator last time out, and has been waiting for his title shot ever since.\n\nWith that tilt at the title unlikely to happen until 2018, Porter will fight the dangerous Thomas Dulorme as he attempts to keep busy. \"I think fighting on network television again will be awesome and a huge opportunity for me,\" Porter said upon the fight's announcement. \"I feel like I've earned this spot and I'm ready to give the people the appetiser they deserve.\"\n\nThe popular Porter should win - his opponent has been fairly inactive since losing to Terence Crawford in 2015 while there are questions over his chin and defence - but Dulorme, who is signed with Mayweather Promotions, would not have been handed the fight unless the promotion company sincerely believed he had something of a chance. Again: expect fireworks.\n\nPorter is still waiting on his title shot (Getty)\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Cunningham's fight against Andrew Tabiti for the vacant USBA Cruiserweight title is another contest that will please hardened fans of the sport. Cunningham may be 41, with only one victory in his last four fights, but he's a legend of the sport and famously dispatched Tyson Fury to the canvas in the second round of their 2013 clash.\n\nThe popular American is by far the hardest opponent rising star Tabiti has ever fought. The unbeaten cruiserweight, who has a professional record of 14-0 2KO, should win, but it will be fascinating to see how the 27-year-old performs against a true great.\n\nCunningham held the IBF cruiserweight title twice between 2007 and 2011 (Getty)\n\nPerhaps the only real misstep is Gervonta Davis' clash with Francisco Fonseca, which headlines the undercard. Davis is a talent, no doubt, and the 22-year-old should be well known to British fight fans after knocking out Liam Walsh in the third round of their fight at the Copper Box Arena earlier this year.\n\nBut Fonseca should pose Davis no problems, and has only had one fight scheduled beyond eight rounds in his professional career. Davis will not only win, but win easily.\n\nAs a whole, however, the undercard crucially caters to long-term boxing fans, before the carnivalesque main attraction of Mayweather vs McGregor. And with the entire evening priced at an eminently affordable \u00a320 in the UK, August 26 represents serious value for money.\n\nMore about: UFC Floyd Mayweather Conor McGregor Mayweather vs

To many others he is at best mistaken, at worst a fantasist.\n\nFormer UFC fighter Frank Mir even suggests that Schaub is playing up the Irishman's chances only because he is being paid to promote the fight by US broadcaster Showtime.\n\nBut whatever his motivation, there is one thing all sides can agree on. Ahead of one of the most polarising fights in combat sports history, Schaub's belief that Conor McGregor has a realistic chance of beating -- even knocking out -- Floyd Mayweather is particularly controversial.\n\nBrendan Schaub believes Conor McGregor has a realistic chance against Floyd Mayweather\n\nThe Irish UFC star (right) makes his professional boxing debut against 'Money' on August 26\n\nThe former MMA star turned Showtime pundit has been over in the UK ahead of the showdown\n\nSchaub retired from the UFC following his defeat by Travis Browne back in December 2014\n\nWhile many experts give McGregor little more than a puncher's chance in his ring debut, Schaub is not phased by standing out from the crowd.\n\nThe former UFC heavyweight turned Showtime analyst and comedian has offered boxing pundit Max Kellerman a $100,000 bet that McGregor will win a round. He has even promised to share a photo of his penis if 'the Notorious' doesn't last the full distance.\n\n'I like his chances. I know it's crazy, brother,' the popular podcast host tells Sportsmail.\n\nA McGregor victory would, 'Big Brown' concedes, be the biggest upset in sporting history. But Schaub's confidence is fuelled by an unwavering belief that the Irishman is unlike most fighters - capable of achieving what should be impossible.\n\nIt's a belief that McGregor shares, of course, and one he reiterated during a four-day, four-city pre-fight publicity tour last month.\n\nAs part of his punditry duties with Showtime, Schaub covered the shows that captured the attention of fans worldwide and turned off, even appalled, many others.\n\nSchaub was part of the Showtime team for the recent Mayweather-McGregor publicity tour\n\nThe two fighters embarked on a four-day, four-city tour last month to promote their showdown\n\nThe 34-year-old former UFC fighter was speaking to Sportsmail reporter Daniel Matthews\n\n'I've been at some of the biggest UFCs in the world.. Superbowls, I've played in some of the biggest college football games in the world. I've never seen anything, as far as an event and a spectacle, like that.'\n\nAs the two fighters traded tirades of abuse on both sides of the Atlantic, attention and anticipation swelled with every passing night. Unfortunately so did the controversy.\n\nBy the end of the four shows, the tour had been marred by accusations of racism and homophobia. But Schaub is defiant.\n\nHe is convinced the shows did more harm than good and dismisses any suggestions that any lingering bad taste will prevent the fight breaking Pay-Per-View records set by Mayweather's clash with Manny Pacquiao in 2015.\n\n'People are looking for a way to tear down anyone who is successful in any arena,' the 34-year-old claims. 'That's the way fans are.'\n\nWhat no one can deny is that McGregor and Mayweather's unique concoction of brinkmanship, bling and bravado made for an explosive cocktail.\n\nSchaub, speaking at the Tattershall Castle on the Thames, predicts McGregor will win rounds\n\nHe also claims the showdown will break pay-per-view records set by Mayweather-Pacquiao\n\nThe pundit has offered to share a picture of his penis if the fight does not last the full 12 rounds\n\nWhether they produce similar fireworks in the ring remains to be seen. Many pundits predict a drab, one-sided affair and even ardent McGregor supporters would struggle to deny that their man heads into the fight down on all three cards.\n\n49 times they have tried to solve the Mayweather puzzle, on 49 occasions they have failed. Where does McGregor start? Does he translate his UFC style to the boxing ring? Does he ditch his counter-punching style against one of the finest defensive boxers of all time? For Schaub it's simple.\n\n'Do what got you to the dance!' he cries.\n\n'People say: \"Conor needs to get in there, bully him, use his size, fight him like (Marcos) Maidana\". Anyone who has ever watched Conor McGregor or if you know Conor McGregor's style, that's not what he does. What makes Conor special is his timing, his distance control and his reaction time.'\n\n'That's like practising the salsa all your life and then you get to the ball and you start doing hip-hop dancing.'\n\nBut Mayweather has been in this game 21 years. Surely nothing can surprise him?\n\nSchaub believes 'the Notorious' must not neglect the MMA style that 'got him to the dance'\n\nMcGregor has risen to the top of the UFC and made his name as a powerful counter puncher\n\n'Floyd has seen every style ever, but he's never fought a style like Conor,' the pundit claims\n\n'There is nothing (Conor) is going to do to get him ready to be at the same level in terms of boxing as Floyd Mayweather. But what he can do is focus on what makes him so special,' he says.\n\n'I tip my hat to Floyd Mayweather - he could have fought Manny Pacquaio again, (Jeff) Horn who just beat Pacquaio and it's just a boring fight to get to 50 (wins) just to say he's done it.\n\n'But he is risking a lot and putting a lot on the line. People say \"(Conor) has never boxed\" but it's this X-factor. We have no idea what to expect. You know how much easier camp is for Mayweather to fight an old-ass Manny Pacquiao or Horn or one of these other younger cats? It'd easy for him, he's seen it before. What he hasn't seen is Conor McGregor.'\n\nMany disagree, of course, and predict Mayweather will rack up a half-century of wins courtesy of an early knockout. But Schaub is confident 'Money' will, in fact, head into the second half of the fight behind. Only then, the analyst believes, will Mayweather begin to turn the tide and 'download' his opponents plan A, B and C.\n\n'After the sixth round, what makes Floyd so special is he takes those tools away,' he says. 'I don't know, with Conor's experience, if he has a D, E and F. That's where it could get tricky.'\n\nMayweather would be taking a smaller risk taking on Pacquaio again or Jeff Horn, Schaub says\n\nThe Showtime analyst has faced scorn for his steadfast belief that the fight will be competitive\n\nIt's in those difficult moments that McGregor's relentless self-belief will be tested. Mayweather is no stranger to fighting boxers who talk up their chances.\n\nBut who among them genuinely thinks they are going to win? Perhaps our own Ricky Hatton, a two-weight world champion who was unbeaten in 43 fights heading into their 2007 showdown?\n\n'Oh come on, brother!' Schaub cries. 'In the States, I think Ricky Hatton was a bigger underdog than Conor McGregor!'\n\nIn fact, the analyst is convinced most of Mayweather's recent opponents are 'beat before they get in there'. But 'the Notorious' is not among them.\n\n'I promise you this, Conor in his heart of hearts thinks he's not only going to beat Floyd Mayweather but knock him out. And when a guy believes that much and you have that skill-set and the way he's been training, I like his chances'\n\nSchaub claims that, in the US, Britain's Ricky Hatton 'was a bigger underdog than McGregor'\n\nThe 34-year-old claims that McGregor's belief he will win is unusual for 'Money's' opponents\n\n'Conor... thinks he's not only going to beat Floyd Mayweather but knock him out,' Schaub says\n\nA lot rides on how much 'Money' has left at the age of 40, following nearly two years out of the ring. The unbeaten American has himself been fuelling rumours of his own decline, claiming he has 'lost a step'.\n\nFootage from recent media workouts suggest otherwise, however, and Schaub is not convinced.\n\n'Mayweather is bullsh*****g us,' 'Big Brown' claims. 'He's not pulling the wool over anyone's eyes. He's still a monster.'\n\nHe adds: 'He's shred city. So I expect a vintage Mayweather. However, saying that, Father Time does not care what you have going on.'\n\nWhether or not Mayweather will have slowed enough to facilitate a McGregor victory, Schaub is unsure.\n\nSchaub predicts that McGregor will 'win the spectacle' but ultimately lose the fight on points\n\nThe pundit does not believe Mayweather's 'b******t' claims of decline: 'He's still a monster'\n\nHe believes the UFC star will win the 'spectacle... land some big shots (and) wobble Floyd.' But he fancies Mayweather to win by decision.\n\nWhatever happens, though, 'Big Brown' is certain that a cross-over match up of this scale will not be seen again for some years. Even ever.\n\n'You're literally talking about the perfect storm,' he claims.\n\n'(Conor McGregor) is the biggest star in mixed martial arts, a polarising figure. He actually took a lot of his swag from Floyd Mayweather so that's kind of why they attracted each other. They see a lot of themselves in each other so they're kind of the perfect match up.\n\n'Also if Floyd was 26, there is no fight. Conor gets outclassed. With Floyd being older and an all-time great, you will never, ever see this again. It's the perfect storm to create this magnitude of the biggest sporting event in our lifetimes.'\n\nThe comedian, podcaster and analyst believes there will never ever be a fight like this again\n\nSchaub has been over in the UK performing his one-man comedy show to live audiences", "id": "9546421", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Ex-UFC fighter Brendan Schaub on why McGregor can upset Mayweather", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/16/19/434E94AC00000578-0-image-a-11_1502909264500.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 784, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 793}, {"textStart": 959, "date": "2014-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 972}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Podcast"}, "id": "311311", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Max Kellerman"}, "id": "389720", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kellerman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Big Brown"}, "id": "426687", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ricky Hatton"}, "id": "427870", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Hatton"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frank Mir"}, "id": "499907", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Mir"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire"}, "id": "688753", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattershall_Castle,_Lincolnshire"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Browne"}, "id": "726185", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Browne"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brendan Schaub"}, "id": "760833", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Schaub"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "1278946", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr._vs._Manny_Pacquiao"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 7, "label": "dmoz/Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 101, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 950, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods and Movements", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods_and_Movements"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "18:59:00"}

Has McGregor accidentally wandered into Mayweather's trap? By James Dielhenn\n\nLast Updated: 17/08/17 4:26pm\n\nThe perception is that 8oz gloves favour the big-punching Conor McGregor, but has he been duped by a trademark Floyd Mayweather ploy?\n\n\"He halved his time,\" McGregor asserted. \"Now the gloves are 8oz, I don't believe he makes it out of the second round.\"\n\nTen ounces of padding on McGregor's knuckles, 6oz more than usual, were supposed to protect Mayweather from the dangerous left fist that has effectively propelled the UFC champion into his high-profile boxing debut. The Nevada Commission's \"one-time waiver\" to use smaller weaponry has been touted as a moral victory on McGregor's side but he would be wise to educate himself about Mayweather's history of glove use.\n\nBook Mayweather vs McGregor\n\nYou can book the unique Las Vegas event online here...\n\nThe unbeaten American has worn 8oz gloves in 45 out of 49 fights, and made his disdain for 10oz versions very clear. His request to the NSAC to wear 8oz against McGregor was for his benefit, and his benefit alone.\n\n\"They gave me 10oz pillows,\" Mayweather moaned after out-pointing Oscar De La Hoya a decade ago.\n\nHe had grown through the weight divisions and headed to 154lbs for the first time to secure the most money-spinning fight in boxing history, until now, against De La Hoya. With the money, however, came the obligation to wear 10oz gloves for the first time to comply with NSAC regulations.\n\n\"They gave me 10oz heavyweight gloves,\" snarled the man then known as 'Pretty Boy'. \"I feel that if me and De La Hoya would have fought in normal 10oz gloves there would have been more blood and excitement.\"\n\nMayweather had learned his lesson, which remains pertinent today. He didn't begrudge wearing 10oz gloves against Ricky Hatton and Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, perhaps to nullify their power advantage, but again complained when the rules forced him to don those versions against Miguel Cotto.\n\nReminded of these incidents by Sky Sports on a conference call, McGregor replied: \"That doesn't bother me. How often he's worn the gloves did not factor into my thoughts, I did not even know that. I do not care about his record, I do not care about his achievements.\"\n\nTwo ounces doesn't sound like much but it can result in minor details changing.\n\nThe biggest impact is on Mayweather's defence. The 10oz boxing gloves are more of a defensive shield.\n\nDan Hardy\n\n\"The biggest impact is on Mayweather's defence,\" explained UFC analyst Dan Hardy. \"The 10oz boxing gloves are more of a defensive shield.\n\n\"A 10oz glove has more padding and more space. They feel more cumbersome - but, if I'm using them to defend my face, I want as much padding as possible.\"\n\nMcGregor and his significant support-base believe the concession to wear 8oz gloves will compromise Mayweather's defence. They believe that greater space has been created for McGregor's counter left hand to find its target.\n\nThey are right; but must also accept that 8oz gloves have been Mayweather's career-long preference. Sky Sports asked McGregor why he didn't prefer 10oz versions, simply to inconvenience his rival. That methodology, the UFC champion replied, wasn't considered.\n\nMcGregor is infamously precise in detailing opponents' careers so he will likely know about Mayweather's glove row with Marcos Maidana in 2014. The argument surrounded Maidana's choice of branded gloves (McGregor is yet to confirm which brand he will wear) and rumbled on until hours before the first punch. Mayweather was threatening to withdraw on the afternoon of the fight itself.\n\nHe ultimately got his way. He usually does.\n\nMcGregor, by playing his part in the glove saga, might have accidentally stepped into the mind games that are Mayweather's domain.\n\nWatch Mayweather vs McGregor, from the T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, from midnight August 26, live on Sky Sports Box Office.

On Wednesday, McGregor appeared on \"Conan\" and opened up about his strategy for the bout, citing one inspiration in particular: the great Bruce Lee.\n\n\"I will go in and dismantle [Mayweather] at his own game. That's what a true martial artist can do -- they can adapt under any circumstance,\" he said. \"Bruce Lee said, 'Be like water.' When water enters a cup, it becomes the cup. That's the philosophy I have going into this contest. It doesn't matter what rule set or stipulations they try and put on me. I can adapt and overcome any situation.\"\n\nLee, a cultural icon of the 1960s and '70s, is considered to be one of the most influential martial artists who ever lived. He first gained fame as a teacher and competitor before transitioning to a Hollywood film career that provided a massive popularity boost to martial arts, both in the United States and around the world.\n\nBut Lee's won't be the only philosophy that McGregor employs during the fight -- he also plans on drawing from his own experiences in the UFC. The 29 year old may be best known for his brash personality and mastery of self-promotion, but he's also won fans with his aggressive fighting style and devastating left hand.\n\n\"The boxing game is almost set in its way. Their feet are flat. They have no spring in and out,\" McGregor said. \"Compare that with a mixed martial artist, they can bounce in and out at a fast tempo. I believe I will paint pictures in there that he has never seen before, or the boxing community has never seen before, and that will cause him big trouble.\"", "id": "9782126", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Conor McGregor is adhering to a Bruce Lee philosophy to convert to boxing and prepare for Floyd Mayweather", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/59960117f1a85069738b4ff5-1190-625/conor-mcgregor-is-adhering-to-a-bruce-lee-philosophy-to-convert-to-boxing-and-prepare-for-floyd-mayweather.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 211, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 220}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}, "id": "303257", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "The arts"}, "id": "307994", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}, "id": "311156", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "id": "319213", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bruce Lee"}, "id": "331634", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}, "id": "358364", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 744, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1245, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Academic Departments", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Academic_Departments"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1395, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy of Science", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy_of_Science"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "21:44:00"}

And that's just insane.\n\nWhy this fight is the biggest thing ever\n\nMayweather has fought 49 professional boxing matches and has won them all. McGregor has fought zero.\n\nAt the bookies, his odds of winning are currently 5 to 1, and expectations are low.\n\nMcGregor is also a UFC fighter, meaning he is a mixed martial artist, whereas Mayweather is purely a boxer.\n\nSo, when McGregor steps into the ring (not the octagon) he's deep in Mayweather's territory. This is a clash of styles unlike anything seen before.\n\nThe hype around this fight has been utterly bonkers.

And the former five-weight world champion was left concerned by the Irishman's tendency to try 'a lot of grappling, a lot of wrestling, (and) a lot of illegal shots'.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nFloyd Mayweather accused Conor McGregor of being 'extremely dirty' during his sparring\n\nThe former five-weight world champion takes on the UFC star in Las Vegas on August 26\n\nMayweather called on referee Robert Byrd to watch out for the Irishmans' 'illegal shots'\n\n'I had a chance to see it, I thought it was real interesting but (there was) a lot of rabbit punching, illegal rabbit punching behind the head,' Mayweather said on Thursday.\n\n'A lot of the shots were illegal, a lot of grappling, a lot of wrestling, a lot of illegal shots. That's just my honest opinion. But I'm pretty sure the referee is going to be fair on both sides. I want the referee to be fair and treat both competitors -- myself and Conor McGregor -- even and fair. I just want to have a good solid fight,' he added.\n\n'I look forward to following the (Marquess of) Queensberry rules of boxing and I'm pretty sure (McGregor) looks forward to following the Queensberry rules of boxing. He had (boxing referee) Joe Cortez in his training camp which is a great thing.\n\n'(But) even though he had Joe Cortez in his training camp I've still seen him being extremely dirty. But my job is not to worry about the referee, my job is to go out there and fight and let the referee do his job.'\n\nMcGregor will make his professional boxing debut when he takes on Mayweather next week\n\nMalignaggi sensationally quit the Irishman's camp after pictures were released online which appeared to show he had been knocked down by McGregor. The Brooklyn fighter, who is retired from the sport, said he had been pushed to the canvas - a claim which prompted White to release the video.\n\nMayweather was dismissive of his opponent's sessions with Malignaggi, claiming knockdowns on fight night are all that matter.\n\nAnd the 40-year-old also hit out at McGregor for even putting a retired, out-of-shape Malignaggi through 12 gruelling rouds of sparring.\n\n'Some may call it a knockdown, some may not call it a knockdown. At the end of the day, it only counts when you get under the lights, that's just the gym,' Mayweather said.\n\n'We shouldn't be here judging Paulie, a guy that has been retired, commentating and travelling the world, not going to the gym at all, just going in there with an athlete period who is working out every day. Honestly, it shouldn't have even gone 12 rounds with a young guy that's active.'", "id": "9793672", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Mayweather urges referee to curb McGregor's 'extremely dirty' tactics", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/18/00/433016B800000578-0-image-a-30_1503011556005.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 263, "amb": false, "textEnd": 272, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}, "id": "307556", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}, "id": "309979", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grappling"}, "id": "325886", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Marquess of Queensberry Rules"}, "id": "350071", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquess_of_Queensberry_Rules"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Byrd"}, "id": "451327", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Cortez"}, "id": "498372", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cortez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Referee (boxing)"}, "id": "753414", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(boxing)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 533, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 948, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1055, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1056, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur"}], "time": "23:20:00"}

The Green Briar will host a special viewing party for the big fight, but make sure to get there early as everyone who wants to watch has to be inside by 9:30 p.m.\n\nInstead of rockers, Mayweather vs. McGregor will take centerstage at the popular music venue.

I am a seasoned veteran and I am confident that I am the better man. After Saturday, August 26, I will be a god of boxing.\"\n\nThough some would dismiss a contrary result as a fluke, or try to rationalize it with claims that a too-old Mayweather didn't take the challenge seriously, it'd be hard to come up with a substantive argument that'd override the casual fan's image of the era's greatest boxer losing to a guy in his first fight.\n\nTo that end, too, no promotional hyperbole or manufactured menace would prevent UFC boss Dana White and Co. from claiming -- with powerful evidence -- that his octagonal empire is the gold standard of combat sports and boxing is little more than a less entertaining, four-sided diversion.\n\nIf Mayweather wins, McGregor can go back to the cage and dare his conqueror to take a similar risk and step outside of his comfort zone. But if McGregor wins, the debate is over before it begins and it'd be a long time -- and it'd take a generational talent -- to get the playing field anywhere close to level again.\n\nNot exactly the best news for the likes of De La Hoya, a longtime Mayweather enemy whose operation is putting on a long-awaited middleweight fight between Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin three Saturdays after Mayweather-McGregor leaves town.\n\nIt's been hard enough for those championship-caliber 160-pounders to get noticed since the Aug. 26 spectacle was officially announced and the subsequent press tour commenced, but if McGregor is 1-0 come that Sunday morning, the Golden Boy might want to consider a gig with a little more security.\n\nSomething in the communications department at the White House, perhaps.\n\n\"If you look at this thing and you look at how big this fight is and you look at how big these athletes are that are involved in this fight, if Conor does knock Floyd Mayweather out, he is the biggest athlete on earth,\" White said, via MMA Junkie. \"He's the biggest athlete (on this planet), on other planets -- he's the biggest athlete.

This is just another one.\n\n\"Floyd wants him to have every advantage possible that he can have,\" Ellerbe told MMAjunkie after today's hearing in Las Vegas. \"Conor is a very confident young man, and I'm fully confident he's going to lay it on the line. He's representing not only the UFC brand, but he's representing his country. He has the great fans from his country. They will be there backing him, and the millions of fans across the world will be tuned in watching this terrific event. We're excited.\"\n\nDespite the fact 8-ounce gloves mesh closer to the 4-ounce fist protection UFC lightweight champion McGregor uses in MMA, it's actually Mayweather who has more experience fighting in the newly approved glove size. Because of that, Ellerbe said he thinks the bout will look different than it would have otherwise.\n\n\"I think it will have an impact on the fight,\" Ellerbe said. \"From a fighter's perspective, you're more comfortable with fighting the smaller gloves. I'm pretty confident the fight will end in a knockout. Pretty confident. It's something Conor wanted, something Floyd wanted, and both fighters got exactly what they wanted.\n\n\"Conor has guaranteed he's going to knock Floyd out within four rounds. He just recently said he's struggling to give him two rounds now. I fully expect him to be a man of his word and come out and be very aggressive in the small gloves. Floyd will be very aggressive, and it's going to be a great fight. We've got a fight, ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\nFor more on \"The Money Fight: Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor,\" check out the MMA Rumors section of the site.\n\nAug 10, 2017; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Floyd Mayweather Jr. warms up in the ring during a media workout in preparation for his fight against Conor McGregor at Mayweather Boxing Club.

On this occasion, which is a much-needed shot in the arm for boxing as a whole, we could witness one pugilist earn their 50th professional career victory.\n\nThree weeks prior to that mouth-watering contest, 'The Notorious' Conor McGregor (0-0-0, 0 KOs) will step into the ring to make his professional boxing debut against one of the greatest boxers of all time, Floyd 'Money' Mayweather Jr (49-0-0, 26 KOs).\n\nFollowing on from this media-hyped event, the super-fight I'm referring to is of course none other than Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez (49-1-1, 34 KOs) taking on Gennady 'GGG' Golovkin (37-0-0, 33 KOs) on 16 September.\n\nLet me set the record straight: I'm not against the Mayweather versus McGregor event taking place. Will I be watching the fight? Yes. Do I think it's going to be a competitive match-up? No.\n\nMayweather Jr and McGregor, along with their teams, are highly intelligent businessmen who know how to sell both a fight and themselves and, above all, how to make money. They are also immensely skilled elite athletes who will surely put on an intriguing contest when 26 August rolls around; however, with no world title on the line, Mayweather Jr on the decline and McGregor undertaking his maiden foray into the sport, it's not the fight that should be getting all of the limelight.\n\nThree weeks later at the same venue the Canelo versus GGG rivalry will finally come to a head, and although Anthony Joshua's crushing 11th round knockout victory over Wladimir Klitschko back in April was a tremendous display of what boxing has to offer, I'm backing this fight to live up to the hype and become the standout fight of the year, if not the greatest night for boxing in recent history.\n\nIt will see two incredible fighters, both currently in their prime, pit themselves against each other in a sport that they have dedicated their lives to since they were children to establish who will be crowned the true unified and undisputed king of the middleweight division.\n\n(Image: AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nThey are also both especially entertaining fighters inside the ring, with Golovkin having produced 33 stoppage wins through his 37 professional bouts and Alvarez recording 34 victories inside the distance of his 51 encounters. With both fighters having won multiple world championship belts, GGG remains undefeated, while Canelo's only defeat came, ironically, at the hands of Mayweather Jr in September 2013 via majority decision.\n\nOn the other hand, McGregor sports a record of zero fights, zero wins and zero knockouts in the boxing ring. In mixed martial arts (MMA), he does tally an impressive 21 victories, with 19 of those coming inside the distance, along with three defeats, which also came before time. However, MMA is a completely different sport to boxing.\n\nMayweather Jr proudly wears his 49-0 record, of which 26 of those victories came by way of knockout, and he is also a five-division world champion who has collected 15 major world title belts. During an amateur career in which he is believed to have amassed 84 victories inside the square circle before turning professional later that year, Money also earnt a bronze medal for the USA at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.\n\nThat McGregor can be expected to give his American opponent a tough night's work on 26 August is just not plausible to me. The UFC star lacks the experience and the skill set to trouble someone of Mayweather's calibre - in boxing, that is. If the fight were to take place under MMA rules, McGregor would surely dominate, but it's Queensberry rules.\n\nLooking at the names on Money's record, he's beaten everyone who has been put in front of him. The list includes numerous world champion and hall of fame boxers, such as Manny Pacquiao, Ricky Hatton and Oscar De La Hoya, who lived and breathed the sport of boxing from a young age. If those men were unable to hurt him, surely McGregor cannot.\n\nIn my eyes, the Irishman relies solely on the awkwardness of his own unpredictable style along with the hope that at 40 years of age his rival's skills have diminished considerably.\n\nSomehow, though, this fight is the one that continues to hold the media and public's attention, with people from all walks of life gathering for it. The reason for this is because both fighters are far superior when it comes to self-promoting, whereas Mexican Alvarez doesn't speak English and Kazakhstan native Golovkin prefers to let his actions in the ring do the talking.\n\nFor me the most disappointing aspect is the fact that what promises to be a landmark occasion for boxing on 16 September has been overshadowed and is in danger of sailing by unnoticed by casual and would-be fans due to the money train and media circus that is Mayweather versus McGregor.", "id": "9532826", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "The real shame in Mayweather versus McGregor", "image": "http://cdn0.theroar.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Conor-McGregor-Boxing-UFC-2017.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1038, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1050, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-09-16"}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1512, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1521, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}, {"textStart": 2834, "date": "2013-09-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2848}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "1996 Summer Olympics"}, "id": "309423", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}, "id": "315822", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wladimir Klitschko"}, "id": "326829", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wladimir_Klitschko"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}, "id": "329430", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anthony Joshua"}, "id": "338146", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Joshua"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oscar De La Hoya"}, "id": "421405", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_De_La_Hoya"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ricky Hatton"}, "id": "427870", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Hatton"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quintuple champion"}, "id": "606733", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintuple_champion"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 527, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 529, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 530, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 563, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "17:29:00"}

A lot of grappling, a lot of wrestling, a lot of illegal shots. That's just my opinion,\" Mayweather told MMAWeekly.com on Thursday during a media conference call.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure the referee's going to be fair on both sides. I want the referee to be fair and treat both competitors, myself and Conor McGregor, treat us both, be even and treat us fair. I just want to have a good solid fight.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the Nevada State Athletic Commission assigned referee Robert Byrd as the third man in the ring to call the action between Mayweather and McGregor when they meet on Aug. 26.\n\nByrd has a reputation for being hands off in most of his fights while typically voicing his objections to the fighters rather than getting physically involved in breaking apart the clinch during exchanges.\n\nThat might seem to favor McGregor, who is stepping into his first professional boxing match, but Mayweather is confident that the referee will do his job for the safety of the fighters.\n\nStill, Mayweather can't help but take a jab at what he believes were several illegal moves committed by McGregor in the sparring match with Malignaggi.\n\n\"I truly believe the ref's going to do his job. The referee's job is to make sure he's keeping the bout clean,\" Mayweather said. \"I want to have a good fight. Like I said on numerous occasions building up to this fight, I'm coming straight ahead so he don't have nothing to worry about. I look forward to following the Queensberry rules of boxing and I'm pretty sure he looks forward to following the Queensberry rules of boxing.\n\n\"He had [referee] Joe Cortez in his training, which is a great thing. Even though he had Joe Cortez in his training camp, I still seen him being extremely dirty. My job is not to worry about the referee. My job is to go out there and fight and let the referee do his job.\"\n\nDespite those alleged fouls, Mayweather also managed to take a shot at McGregor for touting his success against Malignaggi, who is retired and suffered a knockout loss in his last fight in March.\n\n\"I mean last time I checked, some may call it a knockdown, some may not call it a knockdown. At the end of the day, it only counts once you get under the lights,\" Mayweather said about the sparring session. \"That's just the gym.\n\n\"We are sitting down here judging Paulie [Malignaggi], a guy that's been retired and been commentating and traveling the world and not going to the gym at all going in there with a guy that's just working up.

Before entering the ring, fans are treated to a small glimpse of what these fighters look like upon entering what could be the biggest fight of their lives.\n\nFrom the entrance alone, we can learn so much from a fighter's demeanor that it could be enough to sway our original opinion on the outcome of the fight.\n\nAre they stoic because they are nervous or prepared? Are they jubilant because they are happy in this environment? How well did they warm up in the back? Are they ready?\n\nIn just two to three minutes, these questions can be answered. But the walkout doesn't have to be used strictly for answering some last-minute questions you may have had about the fighter.\n\nIt can also be used to play some mind games.\n\nA walkout in boxing is almost as theatric as the fight itself so a lot of times, fighters use this opportunity to try to get into their opponents' heads one last time before they start fighting.\n\nAs we've all come to know, Floyd Mayweather is a colorful personality inside and outside the boxing ring. His words and actions can rub people, especially some of his opponents, the wrong way.\n\nIn his upcoming fight against Conor McGregor, there is no doubt that Mayweather could look to fluster the boxing novice before they throw down and one way to do this would be to walkout with someone with true disdain for McGregor.\n\nHere are five people who should walk Mayweather out to the ring on Aug. 26.", "id": "9550032", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "5 people who should walk Floyd Mayweather to the ring", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2017/08/829624096-floyd-mayweather-jr-media-workout.jpg.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 123, "amb": false, "textEnd": 130, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spice"}, "id": "303687", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}, "id": "387933", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 704, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 898, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 954, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding"}], "time": "12:55:00"}

In addition, the decorated fighter said McGregor has \"very real chance\" at stopping Mayweather.\n\nWell, Alvarez was a guest on the latest UFC Tonight on Wednesday, and during the segment, he was asked about Mayweather - McGregor again. Here's what Alvarez had to say regarding his previous comments (quote via FOX Sports 1 press release):\n\n\"The movement he has from MMA is different from boxing. But my words were twisted. I believe Conor can knock him out, but the probability is small, but it's there. People are writing it off as a joke of a fight, but I'm saying Conor can box, he has the ability to knock him out. Is it small? Yes, but it's there and probably early in the fight. He doesn't want it to turn into a boxing match.\"\n\nThere you go. Alvarez certainly isn't the only person to make this argument, in fact, it seems like this has become the consensus. To say McGregor has absolutely no chance of knocking out Mayweather is ridiculous.\n\nAs far as Alvarez's career, he's coaching opposite Justin Gaethje on the upcoming season of \"The Ultimate Fighter', and will battle the former WSOF champ later this year. Since it's a match-up that features two, very aggressive and well rounded fighters, the bout is likely on a lot of folk's can't miss lists.\n\nWhile discussing the narrative tied to the fight, and his track record of being in wars, Alvarez had this to say;\n\n\"As Simba in The Lion King says: 'I laugh in the face of danger.'

That's not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life.

Of course not,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago.

I don't believe he will even exit the first round, but I'm trying to be humble on national TV. So I say four -- inside four,\" the Irish mixed martial arts superstar, who appeared at \"Conan,\" was quoted as saying by Boxing Scene.\n\nMcGregor asserted Mayweather has never faced a standup fighter like him being a MMA veteran. This, he said, puts the American boxer to a great disadvantage.\n\nREAD: Maloofs bet $880K on Mayweather to give winnings to charity\n\n\"I think the styles of opponents that Floyd has faced have moved in a certain way. The boxing game is almost set in its way, I feel. Their feet are flat. They have no spring in and out. Compare that with a mixed martial artist, they can bounce in and out at a fast tempo. So I believe I will paint pictures in there that he has never seen or the boxing community has never seen before and that will cause him big trouble,\" said the Irishman.\n\n\"Factor that in with the precision and the punching power -- it only takes me one shot.

But wouldn't it be cool if Conor suddenly pulled out a spinning head kick and knocked Floyd out? Heh, oh man. That would be wild. It would also cost McGregor a huge chunk of his $100 million plus purse - somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% if Floyd Mayweather is to be believed.\n\nBut there are less obvious ways to fight dirty, and the potential for a rough and tumble fight is high following the Nevada Athletic Commission's decision to have Robert Byrd ref the bout. Byrd is known for letting fighters go at it, opening the door for Conor to get away with some bad behavior. But if Floyd was worried about the ref being too passive, he didn't show it during a media conference call earlier today.\n\n\"I truly believe the ref is gonna do his job,\" Mayweather said. \"The referee's job is to make sure the fight is, that he's keeping the bout clean. And I wanna, let's put on a hell of a fight. Like I've said on numerous occasions building up to this fight: I'm coming straight ahead. So he don't got nothing to worry about. I look forward to following the Queensbury rules of boxing, and I'm pretty sure he looks forward to following the Queensbury rules of boxing.\"\n\n\"He had [boxing referee] Joe Cortez in his training camp, which is a great thing. Even though he had Joe Cortez in his training camp, I still saw him doing, being extremely dirty. But my job is not to worry about the referee. My job is to go out there and fight, and let the referee do his job.\"\n\nBoxing purists have been up in arms over sparring footage from McGregor's camp that showed the UFC lightweight champion pushing down on his opponent's head, using rabbit punches, and other iffy behavior in the clinch. According to UFC president Dana White, McGregor won all 12 rounds in a spar against Paulie Malignaggi, but was also docked two points in the process.\n\nSo what do you think, Maniacs?

My legacy as a boxer and in the ring is set,\" he wrote.\n\nAfter the fight, Mayweather says he plans to focus solely on building out his multiple business ventures that include several clothing lines, training gear, makeup and even a new Las Vegas strip club called Girl Collection, which opened earlier this year.\n\nBut that's not all - Mayweather announced Thursday that after several decades in the ring, he's officially opening up his own boxing franchise called Mayweather Boxing & Fitness. The company's flagship location is expected to open this fall in Southern California, but Mayweather says he plans to have more than 500 locations in five years' time across the globe.\n\n\"In the same way that I revolutionized the sport of boxing, I'm going to disrupt the fitness industry,\" he added.\n\nAnd the timing couldn't be more perfect, as his face-off with McGregor is a little more than a week away.\n\n\"It's the right time to put my name and my business acumen to work on a venture that I'm truly passionate about, that's authentic to who I am and what I've achieved, and that I know has the potential to be a huge, global movement.\"\n\nJames Williams, CEO of Mayweather Boxing & Fitness, told FOX Business in addition to brick and mortar locations, the brand will also launch a mobile app and an in-home Virtual Reality experience featuring Mayweather himself.\n\n\"We've seen a shift in the fitness industry, in that the average consumer is seeking access to the same training that elite athletes have available, and more studios and gyms are now dedicated to a specific discipline,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Within those offerings, boxing fitness is a highly popular and extremely effective workout. We will cater to this demand all over the world and are doing so under the banner and guidance of the most dominant boxer of all time, which cannot be replicated.\"\n\nBut Mayweather says he's not just attaching his name to the company and leaving the day-to-day business side to someone else; he's actually the brains behind the whole concept.\n\n\"As chairman, I've created the vision for the business and will oversee execution based on that vision, developing the direction for programming and content for the business,\" he added.\n\nAnd his selling point to gym goers is simple: the proof is in the pudding.\n\n\"I want to have everyone training as effectively as me,\" he wrote. \"I believe that everyone - no matter where they come from or how much money they make - should have access to the most elite fitness resources.\"", "id": "9740095", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Floyd Mayweather: I'll make $300M in 36 minutes for McGregor fight - Standard Republic", "image": "http://www.standardrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1502913082244.png", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 104, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 113}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "id": "302718", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303010", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Physical exercise"}, "id": "305854", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox Business Network"}, "id": "306131", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business_Network"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}, "id": "308311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flagship"}, "id": "320976", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Strip"}, "id": "321769", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brick and mortar"}, "id": "321972", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}, "id": "347122", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andre Berto"}, "id": "390617", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Berto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 88, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Sporting Goods", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Sporting_Goods"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 263, "label": "dmoz/Business/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Business/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 267, "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 733, "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Business Development", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Business_Development"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 983, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1028, "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness"}], "time": "12:24:00"}

Good news for McGregor, to say the least.\n\nThe judges, meanwhile, will be a a trio of Burt Clements, Dave Moretti and Guido Cavalieri.\n\nGlove size, finally, will be 8 oz., down from the originally planned 10 oz.\n\n\"The proposal is unique as the fight itself,\" Mayweather's rep said of this decreased glove size (h/t BJPenn.com's own Justin Golightly.. \"It will help them give the best show and show their best talents. It is a long standing rule, sir. But obviously, this is a special event. [...] Mr. Mayweather is used to using 8-oz gloves. He believes they are the best ones for him.

He had an unrivalled gas tank. We came up with special formula and we created the McGregor fast programme and I've been on that since a week after that first loss.\"\n\n\"Since then I have had two bouts and this will be the third one. I've been on this programme over a year now and you'll see the results. I'm very proud of it and excited to go in and represent the McGregor fast programme on August 26.\"\n\n\"We've adjusted certain timings in my cardiovascular preparation. The endurance phase has been stretched out to accommodate the twelve three minute rounds. It's actually very enjoyable. Five five minute rounds, which is 25 minutes, to 12 threes in boxing, which is 36 minutes... you've got to factor in that there's not as much grappling,\" he explained. \"There is still grappling, but not to the extent of a mixed martial arts bout where you can end up on your back and you've got to tactically work your way back to your feet which is very draining. It's a different kind of cardio training. We've adjusted some things and I feel absolutely amazing. I've done multiple 12 round fights in the build up to this. I did 12 rounds just last night. We are more than prepared.\n\n\"I think the team I have around me has instilled confidence in me. We have a solid team. It's been a growing team and an adjusting team throughout my career.\"\n\nMcGregor also has a chef living with him in camp, preparing every meal several times a day. \"Right now I have a nutritionist with me for this camp and he's making sure I make the weight. He's been living with me for the best part of three months now. We've had a hell of a camp. It's been one long stretch. A lot of hard hard work, a lot of dedication and focus. The focus on nutrition has been top of the range and that's why I'm in peak physical condition at this moment. We're closing in on the weight cutting phase and then we weigh in and we fight.\"\n\nNor, explained McGregor, is he any different as a person in spite of the life changing wealth he is about to create with his fight with Mayweather. \"What you see with me is what you get. I am the same person on and off the camera. A lot of people say I'm not, but obviously there are different moments. I portray myself as who I am. There have been many articles and stories written but it's been ok, I suppose. I am who I am. I speak what I believe and people portray that in many ways.\"\n\nAugust 26 cannot come quickly enough for the star of mixed martial arts. \"It's another day for me. Another day of making history. Another day of doing what I have been told I shouldn't be doing or can't do. It's another mega blockbuster event. It's nothing new to me here. The only difference this time is I have a little son with me. We're here in Las Vegas as a family with my coaches and sparring partners and team who have their houses close by. For me it's just been a case of going to the gym, training really hard, I come home, I rest and chill with my family, and then I repeat. The media circus around it is the exact same.\"\n\nMcGregor also responded to Mayweather explaining on American television this week that there could even be rematch. Even as an MMA fight.\n\n\"I didn't hear much of what he said. As far as what he said on the world tour, he said he would step into the octagon. If he would do that, he would have my respect. Anyone willing to step into a game like that where the limitations are so short, deserves respect,\" said McGregor.\n\n\"Whether it's at club level in a small hall or in a big stadium. If you get into that game or any combat sport for that matter... If he wants to do that, I'll be here to grant him his rematch. Right now we're focused on putting him away August 26 and then we'll see what happens after that. I also have multiple world titles to defend and contend in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. We'll see. Maybe after he gets his ass whupped, he can try and challenge for my UFC lightweight belt.", "id": "9747420", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Conor McGregor using strict nutritional programme to be in shape for Floyd Mayweather bout", "image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2017/08/17/TELEMMGLPICT000137224363-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgeM9nLqjJU1C6JsEKW4oStFwRQhn22JEaFKwV0S0pS8.jpeg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 904, "amb": false, "textEnd": 913, "freq": 3, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Television"}, "id": "302838", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}, "id": "304842", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}, "id": "307039", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}, "id": "307599", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grappling"}, "id": "325886", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aerobic exercise"}, "id": "330466", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}, "id": "333008", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Media circus"}, "id": "334524", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_circus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nutritionist"}, "id": "344047", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritionist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Octagon"}, "id": "382893", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octagon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Weight cutting"}, "id": "622243", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_cutting"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 533, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 537, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 578, "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 580, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight Loss", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight_Loss"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "17:50:00"}

And because the eight-ounce mitts are a mite closer to the four-ouncers McGregor has used while building a fearsome reputation in the UFC's Octagon, it's been spun as a victory for Team Notorious.\n\nBut before you tap out the 401(k) for some extra pro-Conor betting cash, here's a tip:\n\nRemember that the suggestion for the glove switch came on Instagram from Mayweather himself, and after a two-decade run in which he's staked out A-side high ground on nearly every negotiable item, it's not exactly in his nature to make things easier on the guy he's stepping in with.\n\nHe is, though, a savvy businessman and promoter, and he's smart enough to realize the appearance of a concession -- even a competitively meaningless one -- is a gesture well delivered if it convinces even one casual viewer that it's worth dropping $89.95 to see if an upset is more possible come Aug. 26.\n\nIn fact, the glove charity seems just the latest suggestion of vulnerability for the man known as Money, who indicated at a recent media workout that McGregor will arrive with myriad advantages.\n\n\"I know I'm going to see a fighter, a warrior,\" Mayweather said. \"I'm not going to overlook him. On paper, everything leans toward Conor McGregor. We know he's taller, we know he has a longer reach, we know youth is on his side, everyone is saying power is on his side. I never said he's going to beat me. I'm going to tell the people what I truly believe and what it is on paper.\"\n\nUpon further review, though, it reeks of nonsense.\n\nWhile few would argue that McGregor is the power guy in the fight, simply dropping a little glove weight won't make it any easier for him to crack the Mayweather defensive code that's bamboozled championship-caliber boxers from 130 to 154 pounds. And even at 40 years old and coming off a two-year layoff, it's no stretch to say an old Floyd remains a quantum leap superior to the sparring partners -- Chris van Heerden and Paulie Malignaggi -- the MMA star has clearly struggled to subdue.\n\nThis kinder Mayweather comes just in time to revive a publicity machine that glowed white-hot as the fighters kicked off their international press tour, which veered toward juvenile and offensive as the chatter campaign continued unedited from Los Angeles to Toronto to Brooklyn to London.\n\nRecent reports of flagging ticket sales haven't helped, perhaps motivating Mayweather toward additional allowances that would boost McGregor's chances in the minds of fans. One of the reasons for the glove concession was to increase the perception that this fight could have a violently fan-friendly result.\n\n\"When it's something of this magnitude, this is not just a fight,\" Mayweather said.\n\n\"This is an event. I think we both owe the fans, as well as the public and everyone tuning in, excitement. I can say that after the fight is over on Aug. 26, everyone is going to be happy.\"\n\nNo one more so than the respective fighters' tax attorneys.\n\nBut when it comes to a real change in the competitive dynamic, it's a bunch of blarney.", "id": "9597515", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Chill, McGregor Fans: 8-Ounce Gloves Give Him No Extra Advantage vs. Mayweather",

It is the most distributed event in pay-per-view history. This thing is in over 200 countries on pay-per-view. Boxing doesn't usual do a lot of digital. You can buy this thing though UFC.TV, through the Showtime app, Amazon, Sony, Apple, etc.\n\n\"If you're in Manhattan or you're on a desert island somewhere, if you have wifi somewhere you can buy this fight.\"\n\nThe benchmark for pay-per-view figures is currently the May 2, 2015 boxing match between Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. The bout, which Mayweather won via unanimous decision, drew more than 4.4 million buys in the United States. Oddsmakers recently set the over/under on pay-per-view buys for Mayweather vs. McGregor at 4.99 million, a figure White expects the fight to easily surpass.\n\n\"The numbers are tracking huge. We're gonna do the numbers that everybody has been talking we're gonna do,\" White said. \"The line in Vegas, the over-under is 4.9 million. Everything is tracking right now to say that we're going to kill this thing.\"\n\nMcGregor has done pretty well for the UFC as a pay-per-view draw, attracting large estimated audiences for his bouts against Jose Aldo at UFC 194 (1.025 million), Nate Diaz at UFC 196 (1.3 million) and UFC 202 (1.6 million) and Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205 (1.3 million). While White admits to promoting some blockbuster fights in the UFC, he says none of them can compare to what lies ahead on Aug. 26.\n\n\"I mean there's tons of big fights that had a big fight feeling. But this is the biggest fight ever,\" White said. \"It's tracking right now to be the largest commercial pay-per-view ever done in the history of pay-per-view. It's the most distributed pay-per-view event in history. The list goes on and on of records this thing will break.\"\n\nOnce it appeared that Mayweather-McGregor would actually come to fruition, White knew it was destined for big things.\n\n\"When Mayweather-Pacquiao did the numbers they did, first I said, 'Good for them' and No. 2, I said, 'That sets the bar.' That showed me if you have the right fight at the right place at the right time, people are willing to watch,\" he said. \"I knew once this thing started to materialize that this fight would be so much bigger worldwide than anything else that had ever happened. This thing is the biggest event that ever happened in combat sports. This fight will reach over a billion homes worldwide.\"\n\nAnd while the bout will continue to fuel the debate of boxing vs. mixed martial arts, White doesn't believe it will ultimately hurt either sport, regardless of the result.\n\n\"I don't think it hurts either sport. This is one of those cool situations where two guys are willing to take the risk to fight each other,\" he said. \"This thing has captured the imagination of people. This fight was really built through the fans and the media.\"", "id": "9597798", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Dana White: Mayweather-McGregor Currently Tracking to Surpass 4.9 Million Pay-Per-View Buys", "image": "http://www1.cdn.sherdog.com/_images/headers/20170816034645_20170712101902_Dana_Does_a_Concern.JPG", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 160, "amb": false, "textEnd": 167, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}, {"textStart": 798, "date": "2015-05-02", "amb": false, "textEnd": 809}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}, "id": "333008", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}, "id": "348069", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Aldo"}, "id": "361906", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Aldo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}, "id": "418449", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "1278946", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr._vs._Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "UFC 196"}, "id": "1284334", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_196"}, {"label": {"eng": "UFC 194"}, "id": "1290111", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_194"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 529, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 530, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 563, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "21:40:00"}

McGregor reiterated that he would finish Floyd inside four rounds, and talked about making history at first, with the crowd applauding everything he had to say.\n\nFinally, Conan asked him about Floyd's comments regarding McGregor's cardio - specifically that he won't be able to go twelve rounds in a boxing match:\n\n\"Yeah, we've made slight adjustments in my cardio preparation. It's actually been very enjoyable to go from five five-minute rounds, which is what we're used to, which is 25 minutes, to 12 three-minute rounds of boxing, which is 36 minutes. Slight adjustments, but we are more than ready. I've done 12 rounds last night, I've done multiple 12-round fights in the gym in the leadup to this. We are more than ready.\n\n\"Floyd is praying for me to fatigue in there, but I will not fatigue. I will continue to press forward, and I will break him. At 40 years of age, he will not sustain my pace.

This could be the real fight of the night and I'm looking to capitalise on that.\n\n\"[Mayweather-McGregor is] one of these once-in-a-blue-moon fantasy fights; it's captured the public's imagination.\n\n\"It's massive, the magnitude and scale of this event. It's a great opportunity for us that this fight is part of this show.\n\n\"Mayweather deserves that pinnacle position in boxing; McGregor that pinnacle position in UFC. Does he deserve the opportunity in boxing? No, but can you blame him for making it happen? No you can't.\n\n\"Fair play for the work they've put in in the gym and outside it, as well, and making this a one-off, freak event.\"\n\nConfirmation of Cleverly's matchup with Jack had been expected soon after that of the main event but only came last week, little over a fortnight before they actually fight.\n\nGroves was similarly kept waiting by Mayweather Promotions in the build-up to his 2015 defeat by Jack and the Mayweathers have a reputation for pursuing subtle advantages but Cleverly insists that, if that was their plan, it has had no effect.\n\n\"It was quite possibly a ploy but it's expected in boxing, in all walks of life,\" said the Welshman, who also has no plans to speak to Groves or DeGale for advice.\n\n\"Everyone's at it, so it's how you handle it. I handle those situations: it's just part and parcel of boxing and the business.\n\n\"I was very optimistic the fight was going to get made and we'd cross the line and get it done.\n\n\"In preparation, even though it wasn't official, I was always getting ready for August 26, so it made no difference to me.

Through the later years of his career, a great majority of his fights have gone the distance, much to the disappointment of many boxing fans.\n\nThe last time \"Money Mayweather\" was awarded an official knockout win was on September 17, 2011, when he faced Victor Ortiz for the WBC welterweight title. It was a fight that was marred by controversy, mainly because of how it all ended.\n\nAs expected, it was another classic performance courtesy of Mayweather through the opening rounds. 34 years old at the time, he was landing his right hands at will and was evading punches that were coming at him, whether the action was at the center of the ring, or by the ropes. The southpaw stance that Ortiz employed did not seem to faze Mayweather, despite claims of pundits about his supposed \"trouble\" against it.\n\nOrtiz did have his moment during the last 15 seconds of the fourth round when he was able to close the distance and corner Mayweather to the ropes. Probably brought on by the rush of adrenaline, along with three rounds of frustration, Ortiz suddenly threw an upward headbutt, hitting Mayweather in the mouth.\n\nThe action was briefly put to a halt by referee Joe Cortez. As the fight resumed and Ortiz went on to apologize, Mayweather threw a left hook-right cross combo that landed flush. Ortiz was on his back seconds later, and the fight was stopped, awarding Mayweather the controversial knockout victory.\n\nAnalysts claim that Conor McGregor may have to resort to \"borderline illegal tactics\" to win the August 26th fight, but Floyd Jr. has so far proven that he can handle himself in such situations.\n\nNine days from now, Mayweather and McGregor will finally cross paths, at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.", "id": "9788332", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Fight Archives: Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Victor Ortiz", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PWJAcGDcXonlY2YNigNz7Md6VRw=/0x106:2445x1481/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56237169/125621811.0.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 385, "date": "2011-09-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 403}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1676, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1687}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Handedness"}, "id": "303569", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}, "id": "315153", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "324818", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}, "id": "350921", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council"}, {"label": {"eng": "Victor Ortiz"}, "id": "390609", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Ortiz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headbutt"}, "id": "390618", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headbutt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}, "id": "467775", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Cortez"}, "id": "498372", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cortez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cross (boxing)"}, "id": "520654", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_(boxing)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis Mayweather"}, "id": "622492", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Mayweather"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 69, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 403, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain Names", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain_Names"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 633, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Awards", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Awards"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}], "time": "22:00:00"}

Absolutely. There is no doubt about it.\"\n\nOne man, though, who was hardly surprised was John Kavanagh, a slightly built Irishman who had helped McGregor become one of the world's most fearsome fighting machines.\n\nHe'd heard it all before, and had witnessed too many times to remember McGregor predicting he would do something years before he went out and did exactly what he'd said he'd do.\n\n\"To go in against a guy a lot of people call the best boxer of this generation and say he's going to knock him out, that's a bold claim,\" Kavanagh said. \"But that's Conor. It's Conor's career. When he was making his UFC debut, which was not all that long ago, I remember him saying, 'Within a few years, I'll be a two-weight world champion, a two-weight UFC champion, and I'll have my name alongside the UFC logo on their ring and in the promotion.' If I had told you that then, you'd have laughed at it. But that's Conor.\n\n\"It's what he keeps doing. He makes these bold claims, and he backs them up with extremely hard work. I've seen him push himself to breaking limits in a number of his training camps, the Nate [Diaz] rematch comes to mind, but this one, he pushed himself to a new level again.\"\n\nMuch of McGregor's success is, in large part, due to the way this witty, humble man who aspired to become a math teacher, has molded him.\n\nKavanagh first laid eyes on McGregor in late 2006, when Tom Egan, an MMA fighter who trained under Kavanagh, brought McGregor with him to Kavanagh's Straight Blast Gym in Dublin.\n\nMcGregor was training in boxing, but was looking to learn MMA.\n\nHe sparred that day with Owen Roddy, who is now his boxing coach; and Aisling Daly, a former contender in the UFC's women's bantamweight division. He dropped both with body shots.\n\nKavanagh tells the tale in his book, \"Win or Learn: MMA, Conor McGregor and Me: A Trainer's Journey,\" of how he had to get into the ring with McGregor that day and put him in his place.\n\nAnd it was an unremarkable first step on one of the most remarkable journeys the two men have made together. They've gone on to win championships and worldwide acclaim, but there was little difference between that first meeting when Egan introduced them than there had been with virtually any of Kavanagh's other fighters.\n\n\"I wish the story was that the clouds parted and a thunderbolt and lightning struck the building as he walked in the door, but the truth is, he walked in the door like 500 young men before him had walked in the door,\" Kavanagh said. \"He came in with Tommy Egan, who was one of my better fighters at the time, and Tommy told me he was a good boxer. I obviously paid attention because of Tommy's recommendation, but he was a 17-year-old, a 16-17-year-old kid who didn't know anything about jiu-jitsu or grappling or anything like that. He was pretty raw.\"\n\nKavanagh, though, saw something. It didn't take a shrewd eye to see, because there was a glow that emanated from McGregor. He was brimming with confidence and he was eager to accomplish something.\n\nRead More\n\nHe wanted to throw himself into the profession and establish a name for himself.\n\n\"He was very energetic and that was apparent from the get-go,\" Kavanagh said. \"He was quick-witted, had a good sense of humor and trained really, really hard.\"\n\nEarly on, McGregor told Kavanagh he'd become a UFC champion one day, but he wasn't at all eager in those days to train jiu-jitsu.\n\nBut Kavanagh schooled McGregor in the art of becoming a professional and slowly but surely turned him into a well-rounded fighter. McGregor got the benefit of time, as Kavanagh was willing to be patient as his new charge learned the game.\n\nIt wasn't until McGregor was 12-2 and in what would be his final non-UFC bout that Kavanagh was finally convinced that McGregor was good enough to back up all his lofty talk.\n\nAt that time, McGregor held the Cage Warriors featherweight championship and was training to meet Ivan Buchinger on Dec. 31, 2012, for the Cage Warriors lightweight title.\n\nMcGregor won the title by first-round knockout.\n\n\"The Buchinger fight, to me, was when I really thought he was coming into his own,\" Kavanagh said. \"The fights leading up to that, we didn't get to see too much of him. He got a lot of quick victories and they were over a lot of lower-level guys, if I'm being honest. But the Buchinger fight was his first fight against a pretty seasoned opponent who wasn't intimidated and wasn't going to be put out of there in seconds. Everything about that fight, the lead-up to it, handling the media, I thought there was a real maturity in that training camp and in that performance. That opened my eyes to how far he could take this.\"\n\nHe's taken it to a point where he's on the verge of earning a nine-figure payday and making himself one of the most recognizable faces on Earth.\n\nDuring their training camp in Las Vegas for UFC 178, when McGregor would face Dustin Poirier at the MGM Grand on Sept. 27, 2014, Kavanagh, Mayweather was preparing to face Marcos Maidana in a rematch on Sept. 13, 2014.\n\nThe entire McGregor team watched the fight, and McGregor looked up when the fight ended and made a bold declaration to his friends.\n\n\"Someday,\" he said, 'I'm going to fight that guy.\"\n\nAnd now, less than three years later, he will. Kavanagh is long since past the stage of doubting McGregor or questioning what he says. McGregor is a world-class athlete who has the kind of confidence most athletes would die to possess.\n\nBut he also has a wily trainer who knows how to keep him in check and maximize his performance.\n\nKavanagh is an integral reason for McGregor's success, though he'd never say that. But he will say it's not a joke to think that McGregor can pull this most unlikely of dreams off, as well.\n\n\"I've seen what he has done and we've been able to use the Paulie [Malignaggi] spars as kind of a measuring stick as to where we are,\" Kavanagh said. \"He has just taken things to another level. I get why a lot of people question this or don't think he has a chance, but they don't know Conor. If you knew Conor like I knew Conor, you'd understand why we all feel the way we do.\"", "id": "9830316", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The man behind Conor McGregor's MMA success",

Franchise gyms and affiliate partnerships at established fitness brands will follow, according to James Williams, the CEO of Mayweather Boxing and Fitness.\n\nMayweather, who had a volatile childhood, found stability in boxing gyms, where his father and uncles trained him to become a superstar.\n\n\"He wanted to create something where everyone could participate, so the flagship will be more expensive but then the franchise and affiliate levels will be more economical,\" Williams said.\n\nMore than 162 million people around the world belonged to a health club in 2016, according to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association. Globally, the fitness industry generates more than $83 billion in revenue.\n\nFranchises are set to open in the U.S. starting in 2018, and they'll carry the Mayweather imprimatur.\n\nWilliams said the company plans to sell 500 franchise gyms and affiliate licenses within the next five years.\n\nAffiliate gyms won't carry Mayweather logos or signage, but they'll be able to offer classes and programs designed by the boxer. The idea is to provide as much access as possible.\n\n\"Floyd wants a successful global business, but he doesn't want to be exclusive,\" Williams said. \"He wants to enable others to train like he has for the past 20 years.\"\n\nFor those who cannot make it to a physical location, Mayweather will provide virtual training through an app, which will launch after the McGregor fight on August 26. Users of the app will get special training exercises and workouts from Mayweather.\n\nThe app is free, but users who want to access Mayweather's workouts will pay an in-app subscription.\n\nThe launch of the gyms and the app will mark the first time Mayweather has ever shared his techniques. It's also the first time he's put his name to a licensing deal.\n\nMayweather at 49-0 is tied with Rocky Marciano as the fighter with the most wins and no losses or split decisions. If he wins his fight against McGregor he has a serious claim as the best boxer ever.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Malignaggi claimed that it was a push, not a knockdown, that sent him to the canvas. Later, UFC President Dana White released video footage of the moment in question, but Malignaggi continued to maintain that it was a push that caused him to fall.\n\nRegardless, the incident left a bad taste in the former boxing champion's mouth, and earlier this week he expressed interest in fighting McGregor during an appearance on \"The MMA Hour.\"\n\n\"He constantly puts me in the press with these edited videos, edited pictures and whatnot. Now, it's picked up a ton of momentum,\" Malignaggi said. \"So yeah. So now the bad blood is there. Now, we've gotta fight.\"\n\nMcGregor is currently preparing to face Floyd Mayweather in a boxing match at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Aug. 26. When Malignaggi's challenge was mentioned during a media call on Wednesday, McGregor was relatively dismissive of his former sparring partner as a future opponent.\n\n\"Tell the kid to join the queue.

However, Malignaggi left camp after a dispute over sparring and shortly afterwards, Dana White released some video clips showing McGregor seemingly getting the better of the former boxing champion.\n\nSince then, Malignaggi has been laying the groundwork for a future fight between the two and Wednesday he went on The Herd with Colin Cowherd where he went into more detail about his sparring with McGregor and claimed that the UFC lightweight champion is having trouble adjusting to the different rule set of boxing and was even docked points for repeatedly fouling during their training.\n\n\"Rules are different in mixed martial arts than they are in boxing and he wanted to know what he's doing wrong and what he's doing right and what not so every single sparring session he had, [Hall of Fame referee] Joe Cortez was there.\n\n\"One thing Conor has to understand - and you see that in that clip that they sent out - it wasn't so much that he's landing shots because most of the shots are missing. If anything, they've shot themselves in the foot because all the dirty stuff he does that the referee will actually warn him for. In that particular sparring session, there's no judges, but he lost two points from that particular sparring session for fouls, for rabbit punching and hitting behind the head and pushing behind the head.\"\n\nConcerns about McGregor reverting to MMA tactics once inside the ring were among the first issues addressed once the fight was made official and the penalty should McGregor do something like kick Mayweather is said to be substantial. But the idea that McGregor, who has never boxed professionally before and is transitioning from a sport where infighting is less strict, might have trouble adjusting to the new way of fighting isn't beyond the pale. And that, according to Malignaggi, is one of the biggest issues Conor is facing heading into this fight and could get him in trouble come Aug. 26.\n\n\"What he really has to learn is to try to keep it within the rules because he's a little bit confused as to what he's doing in there. He's a little bit confused, especially on the inside as you can see on that tape. He's trying to grab and push the head down. Inside fighting in boxing is very different from inside fighting in mixed martial arts. You can't grab. You actually have to know what you're doing on the inside. . .\n\n\"I think Conor has to learn to turn punches over but more than that he needs to learn how to keep it clean. He's gonna get himself disqualified if he keeps punching behind the head and pushing the head down. He needs to understand that inside fighting in boxing is different than inside fighting in mixed martial arts.\"\n\nAnd if McGregor doesn't get himself disqualified, Malignaggi says he has a chance - not a great one - but a chance because he's coming with more fire in the belly.\n\n\"If you're looking at it style-wise, it's not a matchup. Style-wise, Conor can't match Floyd at all. I think what you want to really look at for this matchup is the intensity. Conor's the younger guy. He's bringing that youthful intensity and the intensity Conor brings can sometimes be a change of pace. Floyd's fought some great fighters, he's beaten some great fighters, but all of them, to a degree, have had a little bit of respect for Floyd because they know how good he is and what he can do. Conor is coming in a little bit as a rookie. Call it ignorance is bliss in a way, but it also makes it more exciting because he's not really coming with that kind of respect.\"\n\nConor McGregor boxes Floyd Mayweather on Aug. 26 in Las Vegas, Nev.\n\nDana saying Conor won all 12 rounds against Paulie but he's only released a few clips.\n\nHeavy Hands.

And if you, like me, were unfamiliar with a certain Irish fighter before the World Tour headlines hit, then, well, he didn't make a great one. But let's back up.\n\nWhen it was officially announced that Floyd Mayweather Jr. would fight Conor McGregor on Aug. 26, I was sitting at my desk, watching the office MMA Slack channel blow up and writing about NBC's beloved family drama, This Is Us. I couldn't tell you whether I knew such a fight was even on the table, but when I heard Mayweather's name, I very simply thought: pass.\n\nI don't watch boxing because I don't enjoy watching people get punched in the face. More specifically, I don't enjoy looking at people who have been punched in the face. (I'm fine with the actual blows, it's the disfiguration and the swollen eyes and the spitting of teeth that bothers me.)\n\nWhich is just to say that in that moment all I knew about Mayweather and McGregor was what had made it all the way to the mainstream. In the case of Mayweather, that was almost exclusively his history of domestic violence. And so, most days, I want little to nothing to do with him, even as I see him support and be supported by some of my favorite people.\n\nMcGregor turned out to be a more complicated case. Because before I could throw my lot in with Ireland's own, the beloved son of MMA and dapper cover star of various men's magazines, the World Tour happened. You know, that delightful four-city extravaganza where the two fighters traded racist (McGregor), homophobic (Mayweather) and misogynistic (both) insults in the name of ... something.\n\nI have a rule that if I'm not already familiar or invested in someone when I learn they are -- for lack of a better word -- problematic, I just don't bother. There are enough athletes, musicians, actors, directors, public figures, etc. I already love and whose terrible opinions or nauseating behavior I must already grapple with, that I'm just not going to actively put myself in a position to take on another moral quandary. And so it seemed the World Tour would be both the beginning and end of my consideration of one Conor McGregor.\n\nBut lo, I also had an assignment. I sought out just about every profile I could. (Mayweather, it turns out, has been conspicuously, but not necessarily wrongly, absent from such coverage.) But Conor: I read features about Conor in Esquire, in GQ and then also in GQ Style and lastly in ESPN. I read these stories, watched a few late-night interviews and I wanted to like him. I wanted to be taken in by the brash charm, the humor, the accent. I wanted to be able to cheer for the one-time plumber, the low-key family man, the guy so delighted by a new and unfamiliar wealth he spends as furiously as he fights, the fighter who was possibly insane to take this match on.\n\nI can get behind almost any good story. Here, all these profiles would suggest, was one.\n\nWright Thompson's recent ESPN piece on Conor was just the latest to underscore what could have been. I couldn't help but feel it was trying to sell me on the Conor McGregor Underdog/Come-From-Nothing/Working-Class-Hero (Great-White-Hope?) Narrative. And it almost worked -- he has an amazing story, he's an underdog (albeit of his own making, in this particular match) and I have a totally unrelated but deep and abiding interest in the socioeconomics of the Dublin that's portrayed, apparently inaccurately, in Thompson's article. Conor McGregor is a damn Tana French character come to life. I should be all in.\n\nBut in the back of my head there was my first impression: \"Dance for me, boy\" -- which, with the right response, could have been excused. But Conor's response was instead to say he couldn't be racist because he's \"half-black from the belly button down.\" And then to identify Rocky 3, in which Rocky trains at a black gym, as the one with the \"dancing monkeys.\"\n\nIn the same recon that led me to those profiles, so too did I find pieces detailing McGregor's racist track record when trash talking, or as he calls it, speaking the truth. Mayweather's response(s), terrible as he is otherwise, aren't inaccurate. We delight in one man's lavish lifestyle and condemn the other's. (Let's keep condemning the violence, though.)\n\nI'm not sure what to do with Conor. He seems more than willing to exploit a history and present of very real racism for headlines and trash talk. (He's also quite willing to exploit a domestic violence victim for the same reasons.)

Globally, the fitness industry generates more than $83 billion in revenue.\n\nFranchises are set to open in the U.S. starting in 2018, and they'll carry the Mayweather imprimatur.\n\nWilliams said the company plans to sell 500 franchise gyms and affiliate licenses within the next five years.\n\nAffiliate gyms won't carry Mayweather logos or signage, but they'll be able to offer classes and programs designed by the boxer. The idea is to provide as much access as possible.\n\n\"Floyd wants a successful global business, but he doesn't want to be exclusive,\" Williams said. \"He wants to enable others to train like he has for the past 20 years.\"\n\nFor those who cannot make it to a physical location, Mayweather will provide virtual training through an app, which will launch after the McGregor fight on August 26. Users of the app will get special training exercises and workouts from Mayweather.\n\nThe app is free, but users who want to access Mayweather's workouts will pay an in-app subscription.\n\nThe launch of the gyms and the app will mark the first time Mayweather has ever shared his techniques. It's also the first time he's put his name to a licensing deal.\n\nMayweather at 49-0 is tied with Rocky Marciano as the fighter with the most wins and no losses or split decisions.

I'm in awe of him. Comparing images to the other day, and he looks exactly like me. I'm very happy about that.\"\n\nMom Dee, Conor's long-time partner, is certainly no slouch in the looks department, though there's no question that the little guy definitely has the McGregor genes.\n\nHappiness \u2764\ufe0f #ourlittlefamily\n\nA post shared by Dee Devlin (@deedevlin1) on Aug 1, 2017 at 9:07pm PDT\n\nFather and son will be all about the fight game as time progresses. Conor told ESPN that he plans to have his boy schooled in \"combat\" sports as soon as possible. He also looks forward to telling Conor Junior all about his career as the UFC's most famous and accomplished fighter.\n\n\"That's one of the things I look forward to the most,\" McGregor said last week. \"To show him back my whole career, this crazy journey I've been on. And to show him all the hard work and sacrifice that I've put into this. He will come up surrounded by many luxuries, but he will always know that it's hard work that achieves this. In order to achieve great things in this life you must work hard, and that's the message I will give my son.\"", "id": "9669890", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Conor McGregor enjoys family times in Vegas", "image": "https://www.irishcentral.com/uploads/article/121102/Conor_McGregor_son_Instagram.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 200, "amb": false, "textEnd": 206, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}, {"textStart": 710, "date": "2017-08-12", "amb": false, "textEnd": 722}, {"textStart": 1021, "date": "2017-08-09", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1032}, {"textStart": 1536, "date": "2017-08-01", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1547}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Macintosh"}, "id": "305705", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "id": "305867", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Action film"}, "id": "313939", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Jab"}, "id": "427767", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 374, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 553, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 761, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}], "time": "11:03:00"}

And on first glance, McGregor looks pretty impressive.\n\nThe highly anticipated fight -- you can order Mayweather vs. McGregor on Showtime PPV -- is set for Aug. 26, and the UFC champion at least has the look of a boxer in the ring.\n\nThere's only about 20 seconds worth of video (you can watch it above), but McGregor hits Malignaggi with some pretty decent shots and even knocks him to the mat, though Malignaggi insists it was a push down. Mayweather watched the 12-round sparring session, and needless to say, he wasn't impressed. In fact, he said during a Thursday conference call that many of McGregor's tactics were illegal.\n\n\"My thought is I think it was real interesting but a lot of illegal rabbit punching behind the head, a lot of stuff was illegal,\" Mayweather said. \"A lot of grappling, a lot of wrestling, a lot of illegal shots. That's just my honest opinion.\n\n\"... He had [referee] Joe Cortez in his training, which is a great thing. Even though he had Joe Cortez in his training camp, I still seen him being extremely dirty. My job is not to worry about the referee. My job is to go out there and fight and let the referee do his job.\"\n\n\"I mean last time I checked, some may call it a knockdown, some may not call it a knockdown. At the end of the day, it only counts once you get under the lights. That's just the gym.\n\n\"We are sitting down here judging Paulie [Malignaggi], a guy that's been retired and been commentating and traveling the world and not going to the gym at all going in there with a guy that's just working up. An athlete -- period -- that's just working up, everyday, everyday and obviously it shouldn't have even went 12 rounds.\"\n\nWe can debate the legality of his moves, but the sparring video certainly did its job -- it at least gave the public confidence that McGregor might be able to hold his own in the ring next Saturday.", "id": "9807741", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Mayweather calls out McGregor for 'extremely dirty' moves in sparring session", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/07/14/611e8302-6285-4a83-92af-6a5b5306f62e/thumbnail/770x433/1639a18960dc9cccd174d14fc1579a1c/mayweather-mcgregor.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 341, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 348}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conference call"}, "id": "304722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call"}, {"label": {"eng": "Order (biology)"}, "id": "305344", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}, "id": "307556", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}, "id": "309979", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gym"}, "id": "310319", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym"}, {"label": {"eng": "Knockout"}, "id": "310327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grappling"}, "id": "325886", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}, "id": "342404", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Cortez"}, "id": "498372", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cortez"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 553, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 706, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 762, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 948, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search"}], "time": "01:58:00"}

Floyd Mayweather will once again live up to his moniker, with the legendary boxer set for \u00a319million in ringwear deals alone on August 26.\n\nWithout a punch even being thrown against Conor McGregor, the undefeated American has a queue of brands lining up to be associated with his mastery inside the ring.\n\nMayweather's shorts will earn him the majority of that \u00a319m, as the six sponsorship spots on the material are predicted to rake in \u00a311m, as revealed by the Telegraph.\n\nFloyd Mayweather is set for \u00a319m from his ringwear sponsorship alone on August 26\n\nFLOYD MAYWEATHER RINGWEAR SPONSORSHIP\n\nShorts - \u00a311m\n\nRing sponsorship - \u00a33.8m\n\nRobe - \u00a3775,000\n\nWeigh-in trunks - \u00a3775,000\n\nBoxing shoes - \u00a3775,000\n\nVictory cap - \u00a3775,000\n\nWalk out cap - \u00a3387,000\n\nHis victory cap is worth \u00a3775,000, a sizable risk for whoever's brand is emblazoned on it despite Mayweather's status as favourite.\n\nThese astronomical sums reflect the interest this cross-over fight has generated from both combat sport and casual fans, with the bout expected to become the most lucrative of all time.\n\nWhen all is said and done, 'Money Man' could bank himself in the region of \u00a3186m for a night's work.\n\nEven the ring cushion behind his head between rounds was purchased by a betting company for \u00a32.2m.\n\nMayweather is the undisputed king of pay-per-view fights with the three biggest ever\n\nAnd Mayweather's genius as the king of pay-per-view owes as much to the 49-0 fighter's shrewd eye for marketing as it does for his fighting style, which when viewed in isolation is arguably too defensive to glean this kind of remarkable money.\n\nBut having promoted himself as the pantomime villain for years, the paying public might well be tuning in to see him lose, but they will be tuning in regardless.\n\nAnd the fact that 95 per cent of bets have come in favour of the underdog McGregor underlines his well-crafted draw.\n\nThe American took bags full of cash to his promotional world tour with Conor McGregor\n\nThe 'Money Man' is expected to earn more for a night's work on August 26 than ever before\n\nFight night for Mayweather has been a cash cow for Las Vegas for some time.\n\nHis previous bouts against Oscar De La Hoya, Manny Pacquiao and Canelo Alvarez remain the three biggest pay-per-view earners of all time, and even those are set to be eclipsed despite his opponent never having had a professional boxing match.\n\nMcGregor is in line for a mammoth pay-day too, but will have to split his earnings with the UFC after the organisation sanctioned his one-off fight outside of the octagon.\n\nWhatever the result on August 26, Mayweather remains the undisputed champion of business in the fight game.\n\nFrom his shorts to his shoes, Mayweather will cash in on multiple sponsorship opportunities", "id": "9740045", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title":

We originally suspected that was because Floyd Mayweather and his team were so confident they'd win on August 26th. But it turns out it's because Mayweather is done boxing after this one.\n\n\"Actually I thought that the Andre Berto, I thought that was going to be the last weigh in,\" Floyd said on a media conference call. \"I thought that was going to be the last training camp. I mean, just honestly speaking, I thought that was going to be my last everything. But you just never know what can happen. We're here with this big event. It's just, this is my last one, ladies and gentlemen. I gave my word to Al Haymon. I gave my word to my children. And one thing I don't want to do is break that.\"\n\n\"I gave Haymon my word. I gave my children my word. I'm going to stick to my word. This will be my last fight.\"\n\nAs for what Mayweather will do with his time in retirement? With two years worth of experience under his belt, it sounds like he already knows what his life is going to look like.\n\n\"My real estate portfolio is truly amazing,\" he said. \"I've got real estate that's very very huge, that's a huge part of my life. My children are going to college so that's going to take up a lot of my time because education is extremely important in my home. I want my kids to do something that I wasn't able to do.\"\n\n\"I want them to be able to go to college, and the businesses that I leave for them I want them to take those and take them to the next level. If I took a business and made a hundred million, I want them to take it to the next level to make four or five hundred million. So it's all about giving back.

What will the split be? And how much is the contest likely to make though PPV (pay-per-view) sales?\n\nHere, we tell you everything you need to know about the most lucrative fight in history.\n\nWhat is the estimated fight purse?\n\nEstimates vary, and largely depend on whether the fight meets its PPV targets or not. But after an explosive, controversial and -- ultimately -- successful four-stop promotional tour, that is beginning to look like a given.\n\nThe total figure depends more on the PPV sales, however. Ticket sales also need to be factored in, as well as how much sponsorship is sold for.\n\nBut, if the PPV stays roughly in line with the Mayweather v Pacquaio fight, the fight purse is likely to be worth around $390m (\u00a3300m). Total revenues are meanwhile expected to exceed $500m (\u00a3390m).\n\nWe'll never know! The two men signed a confidentiality agreement when they signed their contracts, meaning the exact split will not be revealed.\n\nWe know that Mayweather is getting more however, with estimates ranging in the 70-75% region.\n\nWhen Dana White spoke in April, he (understandably) predicted Mayweather would make a lot less. \"If the fight sells as well as I think it can, Floyd makes a little north of $100 million and Conor makes $75 million,\" White said.\n\n\"He (Mayweather) feels like he's the A-side and he should get more of it.\"\n\nThat seems a conservative guess: when Mayweather defeat Pacquaio he waltzed off into the sunset with a $240m pay-cheque, according to Forbes. His earnings for this fight will surely exceed that.\n\nHow much will the fight make through PPV?\n\nThe PPV sales for Mayweather v Pacquaio made an extraordinary $455m. Expect this fight to surpass that.\n\nThe PPV price in the States is hefty: the standard definition purchase of the August 26 fight from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will set fans back $89.95, with the high-definition version costing $99.95.\n\nIt's currently predicted that Mayweather v McGregor will attract just under 5 million buys, which would see the total PPV sales at a figure in the region of $475m.\n\nThe fight will be held at the 20,000-capacity T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas -- and tickets don't come cheap.\n\nThe total ticket receipts for the Mayweather v Pacquiao fight totalled $79.1m (\u00a361m). 16,219 tickets were sold at the MGM Arena -- which is slightly smaller than the T-Mobile Arena -- at an average price of $4,451 (\u00a33419) each. Each!\n\nExpect the Mayweather v McGregor fight to gross a very similar amount. The fight doesn't have the sporting pedigree of the Pacquiao fight, but it does have the novelty factor. And novelty sells in Paradise, Nevada.\n\nAny other business?\n\nThe asking price for the title sponsor of this fight has already been set, at a cool $10m (\u00a37.7m). That amount would almost double the current record for boxing's largest single-fight sponsorship which was -- you guessed it -- Mayweather v Pacquaio. Tecate paid $5.6m (\u00a34.3m) to sponsor that one.\n\nAll in all, this fight can expect to attract more money from sponsors than the Pacquaio bout. Don't be surprised if the fight attracts almost $25m (\u00a319m) in support.\n\nAnd then there's the merchandise. ESPN predicts that the fight could rake in another $2m (\u00a31.5m) through merch alone, thanks to the popularity of the two men.", "id": "9848476", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "What is the Floyd Mayweather vs Conor McGregor purse and how prize money will the winner get?", "image": "http://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maxresdefault-150x150.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 274, "amb": false, "textEnd": 283, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Paradise"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "231067", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise,_Nevada", "label": {"eng": "Paradise"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "High-definition television"}, "id": "306797", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}, "id": "316420", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Standard-definition television"}, "id": "359297", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 529, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 715, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Salesmanship", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Salesmanship"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1049, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "08:08:00"}

Roughly a minute total which were provided by the Conor camp. We reviewed them and were very interested in using them and including them in 'All Access.' But it was a series of sort of spliced-together McGregor highlights, eight or nine seconds each. We didn't want to use the whole thing. It was sort of repetitive. We were told if we didn't use the whole segment as they edited it then we couldn't use it at all. So in the end, Conor's camp withheld permission for us to use it.

is Jack's first fight at the weight and he will realise in the ring, half a stone is a jump up, it makes a difference,\" added Cleverly.\n\n\"I see it going the distance, potentially, neither of us

While fans have been chattering for the past couple of years, wondering what this fight would look like, plenty of work was happening behind the scenes to make it a reality. Stephen Espinoza, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Showtime Sports, played a crucial part in getting this fight out of the headlines and into the ring.\n\nWe caught up with Espinoza to discuss how the fight came together, what fight fans should expect and plans for the future of the Showtime Boxing brand.\n\nThis fight began mostly as trash talk between McGregor and Mayweather. How did it move from that to a fight we're actually going to get to watch on August 26th?\n\nI'm not sure that anyone actually thought that the fight was a realistic possibility when Floyd first started talking about it. Most of us around him sort of wrote it off as bravado or trash talking or an attempt to make headlines. But, he wouldn't let it go. He kept bringing it up. Conor engaged and then it caught fire. This is one of the rare combat sports events that was really made by popular demand. Because if Floyd had thrown it out there, and no one had been interested, then it would have come and gone without anyone really noticing.\n\nBut, because it got such an immediate, overwhelming reaction, it became clear that there was a business opportunity here. But then, for the good part of a year, we were stuck at sort of an impasse, because UFC, understandably, had no interest in allowing Conor to participate in a boxing match. Then the fight, even though it was intriguing as a business opportunity, seemed to have an insurmountable obstacle in its way.\n\nHowever, just a couple of months ago, the UFC announced that they had reached agreement with Conor, so that obstacle had been removed. Then things moved very quickly. From that point to when a deal was announced was basically two weeks. Once the deal between UFC and Conor was set and UFC gave their blessing to the event, then it was an easy deal to make.\n\nYou mention the obstacles and various entities that were involved in getting this fight on the calendar, was it difficult to manage all the various moving parts?\n\nOnce the fighters reached agreement, the fight has been surprisingly smooth. I say \"surprisingly\" because, in UFC and Showtime, you have two different entities with two different business models and two different experiences in pay-per-view, focusing on two different sports. So, the conditions were such that no one would have been surprised if there had been friction between the two parties. But this thing has gone really smoothly, particularly for an event of this scale. There have been growing pains in terms of parties getting used to each other's business models and ways of doing things. But, overall, it's been refreshing in how easy it's been to work together.\n\nLeading up to the fight, the two fighters certainly put on a show on the worldwide press tour, how did you think the tour went?\n\nIt's unlike anything we've ever seen before. There's really no exaggeration to say that I don't think we knew what to expect going into it. I certainly didn't expect that level of fan support at every stop. Some of the rhetoric, candidly, I could have done without, but it's a very heated rivalry, and it got very personal. One of the things that [was] demonstrated very early on is that Conor has no intention of losing this fight. He is not ceding an inch to Floyd Mayweather in terms of respect or deference to his career accomplishments. This is a fight that Conor McGregor absolutely, undeniably believes that he's going to win. That couldn't have come through more clearly on the press tour.\n\nYou've been around boxing for a while, how do you think these two men match up in the ring?\n\nIn combat sports, anybody who tells you that they know exactly how any fight is going to go is either fooling you or fooling themselves. But that's the case even more so for this event. I don't think anybody really knows what to expect in terms of how it's going to play out. We know that Floyd is a defensive genius, but we don't know where his skill level is at right now. He's been out of the ring for two years and not just any two years, but the years between age 38 and 40 which, physiologically, are pretty important years.\n\nThe real question is, what level Floyd will be able to perform at. If this is vintage Floyd Mayweather, there are very few people on the planet, including Conor McGregor, that really can lay a glove on him. But, if we start to see that Floyd is human and he ages like the rest of us, then all of a sudden it could be a very intriguing, competitive fight. If Floyd is only 70 percent of the Floyd that we know, and he's facing somebody who's younger, stronger, bigger and incredibly motivated, this could be very different than what we expected it to be on that night.\n\nOn that note, what did you think of Floyd's recent comments to Stephen A. Smith about him \"losing a step\"?\n\nWhat Floyd is acknowledging is what many fighters and many athletes refuse to admit: that they age, and their performance suffers over time. Now, Floyd has been operating at such a high level that it's been hard to notice any erosion of his skills, because he's still operating at a level that most fighters can only dream of. But it would be disingenuous for him to say that he hasn't lost a step. Physiologically, by age 40, everybody has lost half a step, some more than others.\n\nThe intrigue in this fight is, what kind of advantage does that provide to Conor McGregor. If this fight was happening six or seven years ago, I'm not sure there would be much interest, because the reality is that Floyd would have been in his prime at that point and basically untouchable by Conor or virtually anybody else. But, at this stage in his career -- or in his retirement really -- the question is: Is he going to be able to handle somebody with the strength and aggression that McGregor is bringing to the ring?\n\nThe undercard for this fight is intriguing as well, with title fights between Gervonta Davis and Francisco Fonseca at junior lightweight and Nathan Cleverley and Badou Jack at light heavyweight. What can fans expect from this undercard?\n\nFor me, the highlight of the undercard is Gervonta Davis. Personally, he is one of my favorite young fighters to watch. He is, without question, one of the most exciting, action-oriented young boxers in the sport. Every once in a while there comes along a fighter with a level of ferociousness, almost viciousness, with a focus and intensity in the ring that is noticeably different than their peers. It's one of the things that people said about Mike Tyson as a young boxer. Gervonta has that same intensity. He comes in, he's looking to finish people, he's looking to make fights end quickly. And, he's one of the most talented young fighters in the sport. I'm looking forward to that one very much.\n\nWith the other two fights, what you've got is big, strong, athletic guys one at light heavyweight and the other at cruiserweight. I think this will be a very fan-friendly card. I think you'll see knockouts, you'll see back-and-forth brawls. There will definitely be no shortage of action on that undercard.\n\nThis fight is getting a lot of hype (understandably), but there's plenty more boxing on tap after the 26th. What are the plans moving forward for Showtime PPV and the new Showtime pay-per-view app?\n\nWe've got a number of fights that are lined up. We've been very active in the heavyweight division. We're looking, hopefully very soon, to have Anthony Joshua (the U.K. heavyweight champion) to come fight in the U.S. Hopefully, before too long, a matchup with U.S. heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder, which would be a massive, very entertaining matchup in the heavyweight division.\n\nWe're also looking at the return of Errol Spence in, potentially, early 2018 for a welterweight unification fight. What we've been working towards is trying to support unification of belts in the weight classes. We're getting very close in the heavyweight and welterweight division to maybe having one recognized champion. Along that road, we think it's critical, from a distribution standpoint, to be very active digitally. So, I think you will see in the near future, an expansion of our digital offerings.

The former UFC welterweight title challenger is back this week, analyzing the vast difference between the type of stance each fighter is going to come out with. We all know how uncanny Mayweather is, but is McGregor's wide, Karate stance something that could actually frustrate Floyd? It seems silly, but Hardy doubles down that it can.\n\n\"His understanding of range is very different to Floyd's. Everybody Floyd spars, and everybody he's fought as an amateur and a professional, has been a traditional boxer. [...] If you spar with a beginner in the gym they might hit you with shots that a long-time pro wouldn't hit you with, purely because they come from different angles. It's sometimes easier to spar someone who has some experience because you might predict what they're going to do. This is what Conor will bring to the table. Expect Conor to do the opposite of what Floyd is expecting. Expect him to be calm, to take his time, to try to unsettle Floyd. That would be my advice.\" -- Dan Hardy for Sky Sports.\n\nDespite Floyd Mayweather's ridiculous stats in his last fights, there's a case being made for having to adjust to something unexpected. Conor McGregor hasn't really shown anything of his sparring tactics when it comes to boxing, and distracted everyone at his open workout with his impression of the inflatable arm tube man. Other than his MMA fights, McGregor's approach is a mystery to Mayweather. That margin of the unknown is enough to sale the fight to some people, and something McGregor is banking on for sure.", "id": "9597573", "details": {"gpCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Dan Hardy Breaks Down the Stances and Approaches of Mayweather vs. McGregor | BJPenn.com", "image": "http://www.bjpenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/HardyStance.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Physical exercise"}, "id": "305854", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Karate"}, "id": "308996", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}, "id": "313349", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Spar (aeronautics)"}, "id": "353481", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spar_(aeronautics)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sparring"}, "id": "357259", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dan Hardy"}, "id": "592175", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hardy"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1347, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Karate", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Karate"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}], "time": "20:22:00"}

Mayweather likes to bet large sums on sporting events. And not only is he betting on himself, but he told Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night that he would repay Kimmel should his bet on Mayweather be a loser.\n\n.@FloydMayweather gives us prop bet insight on the #MayweatherMcGregor fight... pic.twitter.com/QZ1SQ1VvRB\n\n-- Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) August 16, 2017\n\n(McGregor also allegedly is betting on himself, if you believe the Irish Sun.)\n\nWhat's a little surprising is that he's allowed to do so in the first place, unlike in other sports. Gambling barely comes up in the Nevada Athletic Commission's rules and regulations, which prohibit match-fixing and bets made through illegal bookmaking. But sports gambling is legal in Las Vegas, where the bout will take place, so nothing is stopping Mayweather from betting on himself.\n\n[Someone bet big on Floyd Mayweather as another worrisome Conor McGregor video goes up]\n\nWhether Mayweather should bet on himself is another matter. While still in his role as the Ethicist for the New York Times Sunday magazine, Chuck Klosterman wrote in 2014 that it's okay to bet on yourself if you do it all the time, wagering the same amount through legal channels each time. Otherwise:\n\nIf an athlete bets on himself only periodically -- or even if he bets varying amounts, depending on the opponent -- he is opening a window for corruption. If other gamblers know that a player who regularly bets on himself to win is suddenly not betting against a specific team (or if an athlete who usually wagers $1,000 a game has changed one particular bet to $10), he's sending other gamblers a signal: It's an admission by an active participant that he is not confident. The game cannot be objectively viewed as a tossup, which is necessary to any sport's integrity. The outcome isn't fixed, but it is compromised.\n\nI'm not sure Klosterman's guidelines apply here, simply because of the fact that Mayweather has never seemed un-confident about anything. This is normal behavior for him, even if there's no record of him having ever bet on himself in the past.\n\nOthers have done so, however. According to a 2011 Montreal Gazette story, middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins won $100,000 after wagering he would beat Felix Trinidad in 2001 and then won $250,000 by beating Antonio Tarver in 2006. The practice is not without controversy, however. In 2010, British heavyweight David Haye claimed to have bet on himself to beat Audley Harrison in exactly the third round of their WBA title bout in Manchester, England. And that's exactly what happened after the two boxers appeared to sleepwalk through the first two rounds (Harrison threw just 32 punches and landed only one of them, sparking a British boxing investigation into whether he should receive his purse from the fight).\n\nHaye later clarified his comments to say he merely had recommended to friends and family that they bet on him to win in the third.\n\n\"I didn't physically go into a betting shop and say here's X amount of money,\" he said, per the BBC. \"What I did say is I would knock Audley Harrison out in three rounds. My prediction was the third round and I told a lot of people that and it was true.\n\n\"It makes the fight a lot more exciting for people. It did feel like I'd bet on myself because so many people had put money on it. If it had gone into the fourth round I would have felt guilty.\"\n\nBritish boxing rules forbid boxers from betting on themselves.\n\nAnd then there's the very strange case of Irish boxer Steven Donnelly, who was found to have bet on himself to lose his bout against Tuvshinbat Byamba of Mongolia at last year's Olympics. Donnelly then went out and won the fight.\n\nIn any case, Mayweather will have to make a rather large wager to take home any sort of big gambling payday. Though his odds have fallen sharply as bets come in on McGregor, a heavy underdog, the Mayweather money line sits at anywhere from -450 to -700, depending on where you're looking.\n\nMore on the fight game\n\nSide-by-side training videos suggest hilarious mismatch\n\nRonda Rousey reportedly training for pro wrestling career\n\nWith straight face, Mayweather says McGregor has the edge\n\nAmid border tension, Indian boxer offers title belt to Chinese opponent", "id": "9729595", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Floyd Mayweather says he's going to bet on himself.

Now that the fight is a reality, and that the two biggest stars in combat sports today will square off in a boxing match on Aug. 26, huge may be an understatement.\n\nIn a recent interview with Jon Wertheim of Sports Illustrated, UFC president Dana White said that not only will the bout between the organization's lightweight champion and the 49-0 Mayweather be combat sports big, but the current gate is approaching the annual biggest sporting event of the year.\n\n\"I think the hottest topic, the most relevant thing right now is Mayweather and McGregor,\" White said. \"This thing is going to be the biggest fight ever. Think about this, right? The biggest Super Bowl ever in the history of the Super Bowl did a gate of $103 million. The gate on this one is $100 million. That's in a stadium. This is in an arena.\"\n\nWith the UFC sending its top drawing superstar into the boxing world, it creates a lot of risks, as well as a lot of questions; What if he gets embarrassed? What if he gets knocked out? What if he gets completely overwhelmed by Floyd? These are questions that have been asked since this fight was even brought into the discussion. For White, a man who took a risk on a company, on a sport that seemed to be fading out, to turn it into a global brand which was part of the biggest acquisition in sports history when the UFC was sold to WME-IMG in July 2016, this fight, along with success in life as a whole, is all about risk.\n\n\"Now everybody in boxing, all the big names, all the big guys, this and that, are saying impossible, Conor McGregor is going to get his f -- ing ass whooped,\" White said. \"That's what sets up the biggest f -- ing upsets in sports history. Naysayers are a beautiful thing.\n\n\"Now, as a businessman, if that's the way that I thought, what would I do? What would I achieve? How much success could you really have if that's the attitude?

But from here Mayweather's suspect acting shows why he should never pursue a television or film career.\n\n'There's only one person I can think oh, who is worthy enough to be your hype man for this fight,' Corden said. 'And that person is...'\n\nAnd as James proceeds to say his own name, Mayweather jumps in with 'Kendrick Lemar', which couldn't have been more staged if he had tried.\n\n'Sorry James but I'm going to pass,' Money says, as he leaves the room.\n\nThe 49-0 undefeated WBC super featherweight, lightweight and super lightweight champion, as well as holder of the IBF and WBO welterweight belts, will make his boxing comeback against McGregor this month, but in a fight with a twist. Rather than the 10oz gloves normally worn at super welterweight level, Mayweather has agreed to fight in eight ounce gloves, to reduce the advantage he holds over UFC's 'notorious' Irishman, who will not have boxed to the level before and will have had little time to adjust to the sport, as reported by Sportsmail.\n\nMayweather is due to face Irishman Conor McGregor on August 26th in Las Vegas\n\nThe ongoing circus that is the build-up to the Mayweather and McGregor fight at the T-Money Arena, Las Vegas, rightfully deserves a chaotic and ludicrous entrance.\n\nJames Corden obliged with some ludicrous proposals as he continued to surprise us with some surprisingly good intros as he repeats over and over, 'when I say money, you say team.' The famous chat-show host then proceeded to throw fake money into the face of the 40-year-old, who is set to make \u00a319million alone in sponsorship for the fight.\n\nIn a bombardment of weird and wonderful ideas, Corden recites Adele's 'Hello', the Backstreet Boys and tries is best to fight off a savage young fan looking for an autograph. Sadly for James, his efforts are not rewarded, and with a snap of his fingers, Money's body guards have Corden pinned to the ground, screaming.\n\nIn the build-up, McGregor, who has and Mayweather have continued to hurl insult after insult at each other, with McGregor claiming he will 'knock Mayweather the f*** out', as well as describing the bout as a 'kill, or be killed' affair.\n\nBut with the fight bound to be a feast of rivalry and hatred, one thing is for sure. We all want a James Corden hype man at the T-Mobile arena.\n\nBut unfortunately for Corden, his bid to be the latest Mayweather hype man ended in screams\n\nAs well as leaving the 40-year-old undefeated champion in complete and utter confusion", "id": "9673108", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "James Corden bids to become Floyd Mayweather's next hype man", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/17/11/4352E06B00000578-0-image-a-26_1502966840431.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 226, "amb": false, "textEnd": 237, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-26"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}, "id": "302764", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "James Corden"}, "id": "309727", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Corden"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}, "id": "310322", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Light middleweight"}, "id": "315817", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_middleweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}, "id": "321554", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Backstreet Boys"}, "id": "325091", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}, "id": "347122", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Light welterweight"}, "id": "347124", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}, "id": "350921", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dedication 5"}, "id": "354986", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Wayne"}, {"label": {"eng": "Late Show with David Letterman"}, "id": "359932", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Show_with_David_Letterman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hype man"}, "id": "399956", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_man"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 743, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}], "time": "11:18:00"}

The flagship gym location will open this Fall in Southern California.\n\nEmblematic of Floyd's passion for family, fitness and community, this new enterprise is grounded in the philosophy that fitness levels shouldn't be determined by socioeconomic status, and that everyone should have access to, and benefit from, elite fitness resources. Through a unique and scalable business model with an enticing franchisee and affiliate return structure, Mayweather Boxing & Fitness will be in neighborhoods all over the world - including traditionally underserved communities - offering fitness programs for anyone looking to train more effectively.\n\n\"My whole life has been about boxing and about fitness, and now I'm taking everything I developed and bringing it into the fitness market,\" said Floyd Mayweather. \"Our fitness experience will have programs for kids, parents and aspiring athletes - anyone who's looking to put energy into something positive. The training programs will be the best in the industry, all based on my own workout routines; and they'll be accessible to all, including communities that don't currently have these kinds of facilities available.\"\n\nIn addition to brick and mortar gyms, Mayweather Boxing & Fitness will launch a mobile app and in-home Virtual Reality experience - both featuring Mayweather himself - to maximize the number of people who can access a first-class training experience. Through this holistic offering, Floyd will be, for the first time ever, revealing his training and fitness methods that kept him on top of the boxing profession for more than 20 years.\n\n\"We've seen a shift in the fitness industry, in that the average consumer is seeking access to the same training that elite athletes have available to them; and more studios and gyms are now dedicated to a specific discipline,\" said James Williams, CEO of Mayweather Boxing & Fitness. \"Within those offerings, boxing fitness is a highly popular and extremely effective workout. We are excited to cater to this demand all over the world and be a meaningful part of the next-generation fitness experience; all under the banner and guidance of the most dominant boxer of all time.\"\n\nAs Chairman, Floyd will oversee execution against his vision of the business, develop the direction for programming and content, and share his knowledge, expertise and passion - not only for boxing, but also for health and fitness. To help bring his vision to life, Floyd has assembled a leadership team with deep franchise, fitness and business development experience, including James Williams, CEO; Burrel Wilks III, Senior Advisor; and Mike Melby and Ali Fakhari, Executive Directors.\n\nTags: Floyd Mayweather Jr. Conor McGregor Mayweather vs. McGregor", "id": "9750126", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Floyd Mayweather With New Venture, Starts Gym Franchise", "image": "http://photo.boxingscene.com/uploads/floyd-mayweather%20(14).jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "227084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "228323", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "id": "302718", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "id": "303236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Physical exercise"}, "id": "305854", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"}, {"label": {"eng": "Athlete"}, "id": "308238", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gym"}, "id": "310319", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brick and mortar"}, "id": "321972", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar"}, {"label": {"eng": "First-class cricket"}, "id": "325535", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 88, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Sporting Goods", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Sporting_Goods"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 983, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1028, "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1330, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1461, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Bodybuilding", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Bodybuilding"}], "time": "18:08:00"}

Here is the breakdown of that sponsorship money:\n\nGetting yourself a sponsorship spot on Mayweather's butt will cost you three million. Featured on his walkout cap? A cool $500,000 dollars. The article also threw out a few other impressive statistics:\n\nMayweather's reach as the undisputed pay per view fight king is undeniable, the defensive genius having generated approximately 19.5 million pay per view buys for his fights which have grossed $41.3 billion in revenue over the course of his career.\n\nThe key to Mayweather's insane earnings was becoming his own promoter; in mixed martial arts, the world's most dominant promoter, the UFC, takes the lion's share of the earnings, most estimates putting their cut at over 80% of gross revenue. That leaves precious little for the fighters, which is why McGregor holds the record for highest UFC purse at only 3 million disclosed dollars (plus an undisclosed cut of pay-per-view revenue). Mayweather laughed at an offer for 25 million in base pay from Dana White when White was first talking about making Mayweather-McGregor.\n\nThis is the reason McGregor is so focused on bringing his own company, McGregor Promotions, to fruition. By changing the rules for how his fights are promoted, McGregor can continue his trend of breaking into a completely different earnings bracket, one he will kick off with an estimated $100 million dollars for this Mayweather bout.\n\nJorge Masvidal can't wait to fight Stephen Thomson\n\nBoss Logic got his artwork picked up by Showtime, which is awesome.\n\nToday was the day all the matchups got announced, and they are cracking matchups indeed.\n\nThe statistics look pretty divided but according to this sample Cody has the huge edge in power and accuracy, though Dillashaw keeps a much faster pace\n\nThis is a clash of styles\n\nI'm not sure how much I believe in these Sports Science videos, but here is one discussing glove size\n\nCan't wait for Masvidal-Thomson, if indeed that's the fight we are getting\n\nString theory of violence says this combination couldn't have been predicted\n\nAn look inside the neurosis that fuels Donald Trump.

And almost certainly inside the distance. The men and women setting the prices for the mega fight have universally decided that a champion pugilist with a 49-0 record will out-box a man taking part in his first ever bout under Queensbury rules. Fancy that.\n\nMcGregor's best chance of the upset is to end the fight early, according to the odds setters, who have him at $4.50 for the KO/TKO and $4.25 for any sort of win. A 12 round victory for the UFC fighter is around a massive $21.00. And well worth avoiding even at that price.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, there is precious little value in the main head-to-head markets (unless you have the luxury of being able to stack a huge wedge on Mayweather you can afford to lose should the unlikely happen), though anyone fancying a punt is not short of more interesting options on which to risk their hard earned cash.\n\nThe most reliable of bets surely has to be the temptingly priced $3.50 for The Notorious to be docked a point at any time for any rule infringement. The Irishman is a complete newbie to the sport, will be pumped up for the contest and risks seeing muscle memory kick in, slipping in to his MMA go to moves out of habit that would draw the referee's ire.\n\nAnd, speaking of kicking, and on the same rationale, you can get as high as $9.00 for McGregor to kick his opponent at any time. Though be warned, you only get the pay out on that one if it actually lands, something that is no guarantee with Mayweather's skilful ability to avoid contact in the ring.\n\nThe same caveat is in place if you think McGregor will have a swing at the ref with his hands -- his landing a punch on the official available at $7.00 (meaning the bookies make him three times more likely to hit the referee than he is to go the 12 rounds and win).\n\nThat stretches to $101.00 for the referee to be floored by a blow from either fighter -- probably worth more consideration: Mayweather may fancy his chances of standing up to any blows from McGregor, the referee on the other hand ....?\n\nWith the fight predicted to be one sided, and probably short, there is a temptation to be interested in the 51.00 on offer for McGregor failing to land a clean punch during the fight. The same price is available on Mayweather winning inside the first 30 seconds and putting everyone out of their misery.\n\nFinally, for the nostalgia fans among you who yearn for more even contests between established boxers than this carnival sideshow is likely to serve up -- like, say, I don't know, Mike Tyson v Evander Holyfield -- a whopping 101.00 is available on McGregor taking a bite out of his opponent's ear during the bout; 251.00 for the roles to be reversed.\n\nAs ever, the message is to gamble responsibly and remember that a poor bookie has yet to be sighted in the wild.\n\nUnless you are measuring their worth by the standards of the two men who may or may not cannibalise one another at the T-Mobile Arena on August 27 (AEST).", "id": "9803955", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "McGregor to punch the ref?

Malignaggi is on the broadcast team for Mayweather vs. McGregor.\n\nShowtime Sports and Event Programming vice president and general manager Stephen Espinoza told Sporting News in an interview published Wednesday that White was not correct in his assessment.\n\n\"Dana's misinformed here because we were dealing directly with Conor's team on this,\" Espinoza said. \"We did not receive, as Dana said, a ton of footage. We received a few short clips. Roughly a minute total which were provided by the Conor camp. We reviewed them and were very interested in using them and including them in 'All Access.'\n\n\"But it was a series of sort of spliced-together McGregor highlights, eight or nine seconds each. We didn't want to use the whole thing. It was sort of repetitive. We were told if we didn't use the whole segment as they edited it then we couldn't use it at all. So in the end, Conor's camp withheld permission for us to use it. Otherwise we definitely wanted to use it. There was no intent to protect Paulie. We just wanted to cut some of the clips because it was pretty redundant, repetitive stuff.\"\n\nWhite released two videos of the second sparring session last Friday on his social media. One shows McGregor landing a hard left hand that snaps Malignaggi's head back. The other is much more famous. It shows McGregor seemingly dropping Malignaggi with a combination. Malignaggi has said it was not a knockdown, but a case of him losing his balance because McGregor was holding his head down.\n\nEither way, there appears to remain some tension between the UFC and Showtime, which first bubbled up last month during the MayMac World Tour over McGregor's microphone being shut off on stage and the format of the shows. McGregor called Espinoza a \"weasel.\"\n\nThe UFC is now an official co-promoter of Mayweather vs. McGregor, along with Mayweather Promotions and TGB Promotions. White said he doesn't want to get into a back and forth with Showtime.\n\n\"Last thing I want to do is get into a beef with Showtime or any of that stuff, but we gave them a ton of the footage of the sparring and they denied it, because they didn't want to make Paulie look bad,\" White said. \"They didn't show any of it.

The agility of kickboxers and MMA (fighters) is very different from a boxer, OK? And I think what's gonna happen is, is that, you know, Floyd is gonna - and I love Floyd, he's a friend - he's gonna fight his fight. But I think McGregor is gonna topple that, he's gonna topple his composure, he's gonna throw some things around that Floyd's not gonna be used to. And the other thing about McGregor is that he can strike really, really, really quickly out of nowhere. Where I think, you know, if Floyd does what he does normally, which is just hold a tight fight, I think McGregor's gonna topple that, strike him. If he gets one on his chin (shrugs), it could be over. Not a lot of people agree with me,\" Elba said on ESPN First Take.\n\nMcGregor is a massive underdog against Mayweather, who has fought 49 more times in the boxing ring when compared to McGregor.\n\nElba also believes that McGregor's knowledge of other fighting styles gives him an advantage in the super fight.\n\n\"Yeah, but you know, listen - McGregor's not gonna go in there and try and box Floyd, he's gonna fight Floyd. That's a different sort of thing altogether. MMA's mixed martial arts, so McGregor's not just a kickboxer, he has the agility of so many different, you know, uh, disciplines. Which is what I think is going to be a disadvantage for Floyd. Floyd' gonna try and box, uh, Colin (sic), Colin's gonna fight Floyd. I'm telling you, I think what's gonna happen is Floyd's gonna end up taking off his gloves and landing one on him, really,\" says Elba.\n\nConor McGregor versus Floyd Mayweather takes place on Saturday, August 26 from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.

We received a few short clips. Roughly a minute total which were provided by the Conor camp. We reviewed them and were very interested in using them and including them in \"All Access\".\n\n\"But it was a series of sort of spliced-together McGregor highlights, eight or nine seconds each. We didn't want to use the whole thing. It was sort of repetitive. We were told if we didn't use the whole segment as they edited it then we couldn't use it at all. So in the end, Conor's camp withheld permission for us to use it. Otherwise, we definitely wanted to use it. There was no intent to protect Paulie. We just wanted to cut some of the clips because it was pretty redundant, repetitive stuff.\"\n\nIn the last two weeks, one of the biggest side-stories to next Saturday's fight is the sparring session beef between Malignaggi and McGregor.\n\nMcGregor claims he battered Malignaggi and dropped the former world champion. His team released carefully selected photos and videos to enforce their statements. Malignaggi claims the images and short video clips are misleading of what actually took place in the full 36 minute sparring clash.\n\nTags: Showtime Floyd Mayweather Jr. Conor McGregor Mayweather vs. McGregor", "id": "9794616", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Espinoza on Why SHO Rejected McGregor-Malignaggi Footage", "image": "http://photo.boxingscene.com/uploads/mcgregor-malignaggi-sparring%20(3).jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 439, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 448}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "231028", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Short film"}, "id": "304896", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}, "id": "313076", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tipsport Arena (1962)"}, "id": "322630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsport_Arena_(1962)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paulie Malignaggi"}, "id": "331119", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulie_Malignaggi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dana White"}, "id": "333011", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "Stephen Espinoza"}, "id": "1309189", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Espinoza"}, {"label": {"eng": "OSN Sports"}, "id": "1370269", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSN_Sports"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 292, "label": "dmoz/News/Media/Services", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 529, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 530, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 655, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 762, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video"}], "time": "23:31:00"}

But what made the man behind the manic eyes? And how much of it is real?\n\nDublin's River Liffey is tranquil when we visit three weeks before McGregor will earn a reported $100m in his boxing debut against the undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.\n\nA few streets away, Aisling Daly - Ireland's first MMA World Champion - has just taken one of her clients as a personal trainer and sits in a gym in front of a white board, scrawled with the words 'demand the impossible and you will receive the maximum'. It fits the topic of conversation - McGregor - who met Daly when both he and his world were changing.\n\nA house move from Crumlin to Lucan in his late teens forced McGregor to switch schools. He was dismayed and vividly recalls a feeling of \"isolation\".\n\nBut already a skilled junior boxer, he met new classmate Tom Egan. Egan preached MMA and satisfied McGregor's rabid interest in combat enough to prompt a change in focus. Both men would make it to the UFC through Dublin's Straight Blast Gym.\n\nDaly, now retired from UFC, recalls McGregor's first SBG visit. Wishing to prove his worth, he \"dropped\" her with a body shot and did the same to Owen Roddy - the gym's best fighter.\n\n\"It was a tumultuous one,\" says Daly. \"At the end of that first session our coach John Kavanagh took him and put manners on him.\n\n\"He was arrogant, the same way he is now with the swagger, probably thinking this MMA stuff was easy.\n\n\"So John took him down to the mat straight away and controlled all the positions on the ground. He just incapacitated him, landing a few stingy shots. Conor had respect after that round.\"\n\nMcGregor was hooked. It transpired that unwanted house move was critical. And in joining the SBG Gym he was timely, invading a blossoming crop of talent. He was given his own key after consistently waking Kavanagh up requesting the SBG be opened.\n\nObsessive in his learning, his study honed in on a noteworthy subject.\n\n\"He's always been a massive Mayweather fan,\" says Daly with a smile. \"He'd be coaching, showing us punch combinations and videos and he showed us the Mayweather pull-counter.\n\n\"Now he's in a position where one of his idols is his rival. Knowing Conor, he will believe he is his equal.\"\n\nInterviews across Dublin consistently ratify Daly's view that what we see in the media is McGregor calling on a genuine charisma. The persona is the man.\n\n\"What you see on TV is just an amplified version of Conor,\" she adds. \"He has a genuine self belief you can't teach. He believes himself to a point where eventually it manifests.\"\n\nTo the TV viewer that self-belief is the foundation from which the soundbites launch. It is perhaps McGregor's key component and took work to develop.\n\n'The Secret', written by Rhonda Byrne, was thrust upon McGregor by one of his two older sisters, Erin. The self-help book outlines ways for someone to reach their dreams through positive thinking and visualisation - believing and living as if good things have already happened.\n\nThe intervention should not be underestimated. McGregor talks about the book's impact passionately. Both he and girlfriend Dee Devlin follow its guidance to this day.\n\n\"Before anything big had happened he'd be in the gym saying 'we have multiple world titles, we are millionaires, we have everything we want,'\" says ex-UFC fighter Paddy Holohan. \"I could just tell he meant every word.\n\n\"Conor is an absolute animal, people don't understand. This guy is different. He had incredible belief in himself.\"\n\nThis surge in confidence came at a time where McGregor's father - Tony - told him MMA would not pay.\n\nThey clashed when McGregor sacrificed a plumbing apprenticeship in order to train and retaliating, he told his father he would be a millionaire by the age of 25. He was by 26 and the bloody-mindedness in getting there has influenced a generation.\n\n\"When Conor rose to prominence in 2009, the country was in a crippling recession,\" Peter Carroll, Ireland's longest serving MMA journalist, tells us.\n\n\"He was one of the guys affected by it. He was the one guy that said I'm going to do something no one really knows about and I'll be the biggest success story this country has seen. I think it gave people hope and a lot of people, particularly youngsters, attached to that.\"\n\nCarroll has covered McGregor closely since the early years. He has witnessed his desire to visualise positive outcomes, notably when spin-kicking in his boxer shorts each morning while verbally convincing himself an injured knee had improved overnight.\n\nThe street on which we meet in Blanchardstown houses a butcher, bakery and coffee shop. It feels sleepy, local. Carroll is passionate, insightful and almost disbelieving of how McGregor became so global.\n\n\"I always thought he was going to either die really young or be a superstar because he was a million miles an hour,\" he adds.\n\n\"He had this aura about him right back then, when he walked into a room, every single eye was on him. He's not staggeringly handsome but he exudes this energy, this presence. I've never witnessed it in anyone else.\n\n\"It was like he was trained from nine years old how to do interviews. He was always an extrovert. I remember the first time I saw him there were around 200 people at a fight in a small club and Conor was the loudest person in the room.\n\n\"Even there, he was decked out in the highest trends, the funky jeans we all thought were really cool but look atrocious now, and he had a Paddy cap on. I don't think he needed cameras to be that guy, he was always that guy.\"\n\nBoth Daly and Holohan echo Carroll's recollections of McGregor's fashion statements long before his Instagram account began showcasing his expensive threads, long before \u00a320,000 mink robes, long before suits with expletive-laden pin stripes.\n\nA day before we meet with all three of them, they team up to defend MMA in a radio debate. McGregor's success helps catapult a sport some deem too violent into the mainstream.\n\n\"I think it's a generation problem,\" adds Carroll. \"I don't know how we are stuck in a conversation which was going on 25 years ago in America, especially given we have the biggest star in combat sports here in Ireland.\"\n\nMark, a cabbie awaiting a fare on O'Connell Street, believes McGregor is \"love-hate\".\n\n\"We don't like people who are arrogant and brash as a rule\" he says. \"My generation tends to think 'calm it down a bit Conor'.\"\n\nIn studying what makes McGregor, one wonders if this divide in some way suits him. The more you delve in to his self belief, the more you feel he'd rather lead an army of fellow believers than carry those of indifference.\n\n\"There's this avid cultural transition we see through Conor,\" adds Carroll. \"He's seen as a compass for youngsters when it comes to fashion, how they speak, how they act. I don't think Ireland has ever produced a bigger star in sport.\n\n\"This is the first time we have had someone trying to get on to the next thing, constantly breaking boundaries. A lot of Irish stars before have been unassuming, with an almost happy-to-be-here mentality.\n\n\"Knowing Conor like I know Conor, he always wants to do something bigger. I don't know how the hell it gets bigger than this but it will.\"\n\nCrumlin Boxing Club, where McGregor started hitting bags aged 12, is nestled in-between the local football club's artificial pitch and parkland equipped with rugby posts.\n\nMcGregor's face can barely be found among the hundreds of images on the walls lapping two rings. The truth is this place lost him. Those MMA conversations with Egan in class proved too distracting.\n\nA short drive away is the Black Forge Inn, where a visit from the local hero is known to prompt \"mayhem\".\n\n\"The last time he was in here I told him he could buy this pub,\" says landlord Liam Flynn. \"The next time I see him I will say to him 'Conor, I don't think you can afford it'. With him, that reverse psychology means he'll buy it.\"\n\nIn almost 48 hours in Dublin, Flynn is the first person to state McGregor - now a father - may be mellowing, describing him as \"totally different to five years ago\".\n\nWhile we are told his frenzied nature is his true nature, surely a personality so unique, puffed-up by ongoing success, will need to plot carefully to avoid flying too close to the sun? If the rise was rapid, the fall could be spectacular.\n\n\"The guys you see with him in photographs are the ones who liked the irritating spotty 18-year-old Conor and they are still there because they care,\" adds Daly. \"He can trust them. Not many new people have come into the circle so he's making smart decisions.\"\n\nThose closest to him knew McGregor when he was picking up 188 euros-a-week in welfare. Success has brought a new home on the exclusive grounds of the K-Club, located just outside his home city.\n\n\"What you see of Conor now is what he was when he had less money,\" says Holohan, as he prepares to take a kids MMA class in his new SBG Dublin 24 gym. \"People don't know what it's like to be 29 years of age and be able to have anything they want. Thinking about it he is probably a bit tame for someone with that kind of power.\n\n\"For me, Conor is handling things like a boss. Now he has the chance to kidnap boxing.\"\n\nOur visit to Dublin issues a belief that McGregor is more than a passing trend or conversation point.\n\n\"Every single young guy in a MMA gym now thinks they are Conor McGregor,\" adds Carroll. \"It's crazy but there will never be another one.\"\n\nTellingly, those close to him maintain what we see is what they have always got - a vocal, visionary and vicious force.\n\nIt seems the public can trust in his persona.\n\nBut how quickly will Father Time erode its magnetism? Will age dilute the confidence holding the key elements of The Notorious together?\n\nNine frantic years have passed since his first MMA fight. A win in his first in the boxing ring could take McGregor's influence beyond a point not even he could have visualised.", "id": "9619412", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Conor

Will he, in his pro boxing debut, actually be able to defeat the greatest defensive genius of our time in Floyd Mayweather Jr.? With 49 career wins on Floyd's record, no one has been able to beat him yet. Why does Conor feel he is the one to make history and succeed where so many others have failed?\n\nWith all the press conferences, media calls, disgruntled sparring partners, and everything else. We still haven't heard much about just how Conor plans to fight Floyd. However, in his appearance on Conan last night, McGregor gave us a hint.\n\n\"I think the styles of opponents that Floyd has faced have moved in a certain way,\" McGregor explained. \"The boxing game is almost set in its way. I feel their feet are flat, they have no spring in and out. Compare that with a mixed martial artist; they can bounce in and out at a fast tempo. So I believe I will paint pictures in there that he has never seen before or the boxing community have never seen before and that will cause him big trouble. Factor that in with the precision and punching power. It only takes me one shot. I have KO'd men inside three-seconds. I won the UFC featherweight title in 13-seconds. So factor all those things, plus with the punching power and precision, it's over for Floyd and that's it.\"\n\nIs that how the Irishman plans to approach this, by bouncing in and out and picking angles reminiscent of a Lyoto Machida or Stephen \"Wonderboy\" Thompson point karate style? Hmmmm... it will be different, that's for sure. How will it look in a pure boxing scenario and will it be effective against the best of our era?

He was less than 24 hours off a plane before going into a 12-round sparring session with Conor McGregor. he didn't have all the time in the world to loosen up. His accommodations were not ideal. He does admit to getting winded in the latter part of that session, during which time there were some clips posted by UFC president Dana White showing him getting allegedly knocked down.\n\nMaybe that's a knockdown; maybe that's a slip, but what was he really doing there in the first place? He had made some critical remarks about McGregor's ability to box - in fact, going so far as to call him out in December for a fight (presumably if the bout with Mayweather fell through). Did he think they were going to fly him out there for the purposes of making HIM look good?\n\nYes, we are in the midst of the hype machine. Yes, boxing people - the professionals in this business - do not often put a lot of stock in the results of sparring sessions. But these are not boxing people involved here, for the most part, and clearly Malignaggi realized that everything was going to be done to put McGregor in the best light.\n\nStill, if you are looking to come away with something that might lend you a little encouragement on your way to the betting window with some McGregor money, it's a flush left hand that McGregor landed in one of those clips distributed by White. He is not without some pop, if you're standing there waiting for it to come. Not to say that Mayweather is ever going to leave himself open for anything like that, but at least the MMA champion landed a punch on a professional fighter.\n\nBy the way, Showtime isn't going to use any of that stuff in its \"All Access\" series promoting this thing. Stephen Espinoza, who is in charge of sports programming, explains that he was presented an edited version of the clips by the McGregor camp, which essentially showed highlights of his, and that they would not let them be used in any other form.\n\n\"We were told if we didn't use the whole segment as they edited it then we couldn't use it at all,\" Espinosa told the Sporting News. \"So in the end, Conor's camp withheld permission for us to use it. Otherwise we definitely wanted to use it.\"\n\nMalignaggi, as we know, retired after losing four of his last eight fights. He said that they wouldn't let him work out before this sparring session. Steve Forbes, the former IBF 130-pound champion, contends that the McGregor camp reached out for him as well, even though he has been retired for almost three years. And he saw a trap. They were reaching out for guys who have credentials, but aren't active or in shape to go long distances. Chris Van Heerden, a South African who once held the IBO welterweight crown (and who IS active, we grant you), says he was a victim of some \"propaganda\" on the part of McGregor's camp but at least had some video evidence to counter that. He acknowledges Conor's power, but has also been vocal about his weaknesses.\n\n\"He's dropping his hands, and he's putting his chin out there. Stuff like that,\" he told a reporter. \"Pretty bad. He doesn't throw in combinations. That's the big thing that MMA fighters lack. And that's the upside of boxing.\"\n\nAll of this, however, kind of strays from the point we're trying to make. Ideally, it's great for Malignaggi, as part of the Showtime broadcast team, to get that \"up close\" experience so he can pass some insight on to the viewers. And when we examine some of his quotes after accepting the invitation to camp, that seemed to be his agenda. But he was badly positioned right from the beginning as someone who had offered up a disparaging opinion of McGregor. Human nature being what it is, that may have provided extra motivation for McGregor and White to manipulate the situation to make him look bad and make themselves look good at the same time, if they did indeed manipulate things.\n\nSo Malignaggi now comes out of this debacle, believing that he has to perform some\"damage control,\" and it doesn't necessarily paint the best picture of him. Regardless of the selectivity of the footage released, the clips have gone viral, to the point where this has become a major part of the \"news cycle\" and remains that way. Malignaggi has, in effect, become a character in this whole drama, and that isn't really where you want to be if you are someone describing the event for the team (network) that is not only distributing the fight for pay television, but also actively promoting it as something that is worth the money they're charging. You would like to think you could get some objectivity out of them, but now they have a guy who's got an ax to grind.

The Conor of today is better than the Conor of yesterday,\" his coach Owen Roddy exclusively told Sky Sports. \"He gets better every day, every week\n\nConor is such a good student.

We're limited with the weapons we can use, but we're trying to lead the opponent into Conor's shot.\"\n\nThe fitness\n\n\"We're training five-and-a-half or six days a week,\" said Julian Dalby, the sports scientist who oversees the 'McGregor F.A.S.T Extreme performance training plan'.\n\n\"It stands for Fighter Anaerobic System of Training.

It isn't a 100m sprint compared to middle-distance running. There are more strikes thrown in boxing than MMA so it's a more continuous power output. MMA requires higher anaerobic peak outputs for takedowns.\n\n\"Typically Conor does skills-based training early in the day, then conditioning training later so he doesn't have to hold back. Traditionally an athlete might do both together so they hold back.\n\n\"At this weight, there is a slight trade-off with his maximum power but an increase in his VO2 Max (his ability to perform consistently).\"\n\nThe diet\n\n\"On an average day, he eats nine times,\" said McGregor's nutritionist George Lockhart. \"It's insane how amazing his body is looking. We give him 4,000 calories a day because he expends so much energy.\n\nHe really likes lamb! Every time we eat it... he really loves lamb.\n\nNutritionist George Lockhart\n\n\"I go grocery shopping three times a day, to make sure each meal is as fresh as possible.

Tables are $40 for four people.\n\nHalftime owner Casey Aylward said there are some tickets remaining for his 106-seat sports bar and restaurant.\n\nHe said he wouldl sell pre-seating tickets at the $10 rate and keep 20 or so spots open for $20 night-of-the-event admission.\n\n\"Regardless of the outcome of the fight, we will be open until 2 a.m.,\" he said.\n\nHe said the decision to pre-sale was for the fans.\n\n\"You have paid for your seat and you have one. You won't have to worry about finding a seat,\" he said. \"And, if you are with friends or a group, you are assured of being seated together.\"\n\nThe fight price at either New Bern location is a bargain for spectators compared to ordering it at home, at a cost upwards of $100.\n\nAylward said that based on seating capacity of $3,500 per 100 seats, his tickets will not cover that cost.\n\n\"I will lose money on the fight,\" he said. \"But, I am doing this for the people of New Bern and our customers. Being locally owned and in competition, this is also about showing that we are a legitimate sports bar.\"\n\nHe said he hopes to break even on the broadcast cost through the sale of drinks and food.\n\nDespite the hype, Mayweather is an overwhelming favorite by the odds makers. Mayweather is a traditional boxer and McGregor is a mixed martial arts fighter, where hands and feet are allowed for administrating blows.\n\nAccording to the web site entrepreneur.com, Mayweather has been in many of the top pay-per-view sporting events in history.\n\nHis 2015 bout against boxer Manny Pacquiao attracted more than four million pay viewers and netted $400 million in revenue.\n\nBoth fighters are undefeated, with Mayweather 49-0 with 26 knockouts. McGregor has no professional boxing record. He is the UFC featherweight champ.\n\nThe bout will be in the T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada.\n\nCharlie Hall can be reached at 252-635-5667 or 252-259-7585, or charlie.hall@newbernsj.com.

It also conveniently overlooks the various times he's been wrong.\n\nSuggesting his rise happened due to sheer force of will also ignores the fact that the UFC immediately identified him as a potential superstar and gave him a massive push, including an individual open workout in advance of his sophomore appearance in the Octagon. His charisma and abilities in the cage were always going to allow him to connect with fans and become a superstar, but being given the superstar treatment (deservedly so) by the promotion right out of the gate certainly helped.\n\nMcGregor didn't speak this fight with Mayweather into existence, either.\n\nFloyd copped to starting the initial rumor of a potential big-money clash with the UFC champion last May, and if you think this contest came together for any reason other than a bunch of people knowing they can make truckloads of money, well, I have some really nice oceanfront property in Montana that I think you might be interested in.\n\nThe reason all of this talk of ethereal powers bothers me so much is because it takes away from McGregor's actual remarkable story of success.\n\nWhether you like him or not, the fact that he's gone from being on social assistance to headlining arguably the biggest fight in boxing history in under five years is a tremendous testament to his focus, effort and talent and the ability of the people around him (coaches, managers, promoters) to recognize his star potential and partner with him to maximize the potential returns.\n\nThere have been innumerable fighters that have talked about the historic achievements they would accomplish in their careers who fell drastically short of making good on their claims, so the fact that McGregor was actually able to back up a great deal of what he's said should be respected, but not held out as proof that he's psychic.\n\nMaybe he will go out and shock the world on Aug. 26 and maybe he'll even do it in the fashion he's predicted -- a second-round knockout, adjusted from \"inside of four\" now that they're fighting in eight-ounce gloves -- giving the McGregor acolytes another chance to boast about the mystic powers of their idol.\n\nBut if he doesn't, what becomes of \"Mystic Mac,\" the fight-sports fortune-teller who can align the stars to make his prophecies come true?\n\nWill there be backlash against the psychic whose powers to predict the future turned out to be a charade, or will his followers and everyone else simply admit what we've known all along -- that McGregor no mystic; he's simply an incredible mixed martial artist who is out of his depths stepping in against one of the best boxers in the history of sport?\n\nSpencer Kyte covers MMA for The Sun and The Province.

If anything I see stiffness in every single one of them.\n\n\"You must have the limbs free. Your shoulders must be disconnected. You must have the ability to disconnect your shoulder and reconnect it at the point of impact. That skill set is how you change a jab to a hook in the blink of an eye or a jab to an uppercut in the blink of an eye.\n\n\"It's the same thing with hip flexors with kicks. If I throw a teep, a front kick, to your midsection and I'm tight in the hips and can't free the legs like I can free my shoulders, like I showed with one of many training methods of how to free the shoulders, if I can do that with my hip flexors then I can change the point of impact from the belly and switch it up to the head in a millisecond.\n\n\"These are age old training methods. That shoulder training method that you saw was made very popular by the great Rickson Gracie, one of the pioneers of mixed martial arts. It's a shoulder-loosening exercise. It gets the shoulders warmed up but you've got to do it correctly.\n\nEveryone in the gym was doing their best Conor McGregor impression today, I think I won.

In the opinion of Richard Perez, who serves as the boxing coach for McGregor's arch-rival Nate Diaz, McGregor doesn't even have that. Richard Perez also believes McGregor's cardio issues - which plagued him in his fights with Diaz - will be a problem against Mayweather, and that the Irishman might resort to shady tactics to combat this problem.\n\n\"No, he doesn't have a punchers chance - and he gasses out,\" Perez said on Wednesday's edition of BJ Penn Radio. \"I don't care how hard he trains. They've got to watch out for him, because he's probably going to take the substance that he did when he [fought] with Nathan, that woke him up. I know they're taking tests, but they've got to be careful with that because he will do it. There's no way he's going to do this without taking any substances, and be strong in boxing, because boxing is a lot of stamina.\"\n\nWhen asked for clarification as to what substance McGregor took in his fight with Diaz, Perez elaborated:\n\n\"Oh yeah, they even said it to me afterwards, it was awhile after the fight, that they did find him taking some substance. But they didn't do anything to him.\"\n\n\"It was after the fight, probably a couple months after the fight, they brought it up about him. [At the time of] the last fight, it was the last fight that Nathan fought him.\"\n\nHe continued, also expressing skepticism about McGregor's rapid mass gain as he moved from featherweight to welterweight to battle Diaz:\n\n\"When you think about it, a guy at 145 [pounds], moving up to 170 the first time, he bulked up in muscle, that's not going to happen. You're going to have some fat in you cause you're short. You're not going to be all muscle like that. I even said, when Nathan first fought him, when they called him, I said, 'look, he's got to be on some kind of steroids or substance.' And when Nathan asked [McGregor], he got really upset about it. If it had been me, I would have been laughing about it. I would have [sarcastically] been like 'yeah steroids, yeah, yeah,' but he was really mad, he was angry. So that speaks for itself right there. Mayweather and them really need to have that guy checked.\"\n\n\"After the last fight, I read it, it's not steroids, it's something that bulks you up, I forget what it's called. It's illegal, still you can't use it in the UFC, even in boxing you can't use it. So I guess now that's why they're both being tested every week. I'm not sure how true that is, but...\"\n\nWhat do you think of these comments on Conor McGregor from Richard Perez?", "id": "9766123", "details": {"gpCnt": 5}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Diaz coach Richard Perez claims Conor McGregor took \"substance\" to help with stamina, mass gains | BJPenn.com", "image": "http://www.bjpenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Conor-Mcgregor.png", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 22, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 31}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Muscle"}, "id": "302851", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "id": "310320", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punch (combat)"}, "id": "315151", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(combat)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}, "id": "333008", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}, "id": "336168", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr."}, "id": "345422", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather,_Jr."}, {"label": {"eng": "B.J.

Now, with two fights in the bag, the score stands at one apiece and though fans are clamouring to see their long-awaited rubber match, McGregor is, of course, busy right now as he prepares, once again, for the biggest fight of his life, something he has found himself doing in pretty much every fight camp he has undergone in recent years.\n\nDiaz, on the other hand, is in something of a standoff with the UFC and though fans are dying to see him back inside the octagon, he seems more than happy just to sit back and wait for the right fight or the right paycheck to come along.\n\nHis boxing coach, the famed Richard Perez, appeared on BJPenn Radio to discuss the divisive topic that is Mayweather/McGregor and though he has seen his own fighter eat quite a few left-hands from the Irishman in their pair of fights, he still maintains that Conor's puncher's chance is near non-existent against a fighter of Floyd's calibre.\n\nDuring the same interview, he levelled some accusations at the 'Notorious' one that have seemingly come completely out of the left-field, ones relating to some possible foul play on his part, something that may well hit a nerve when it reaches the ears of the UFC's lightweight champion.\n\n\"No, he doesn't have a punchers chance, and he gasses out. I don't care how hard he trains. They've got to watch out for him, because he's probably going to take the substance that he did when he [fought] with Nathan, that woke him up. I know they're taking tests, but they've got to be careful with that because he will do it. There's no way he's going to do this without taking any substances, and be strong in boxing, because boxing is a lot of stamina.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, they even said it to me afterwards, it was awhile after the fight, that they did find him taking some substance. But they didn't do anything to him. It was after the fight, probably a couple months after the fight, they brought it up about him. The last fight, it was the last fight that Nathan fought him.\"\n\nNot willing to leave it at that, Perez went one step further and questioned the validity of McGregor's weightgain during the jump from featherweight to welterweight when he first fought Diaz at UFC 196.\n\n\"When you think about it, a guy at 145 moving up to 170 the first time, he bulked up in muscle, that's not going to happen. You're going to have some fat in you cause you're short. You're not going to be all muscle like that. I even said, when Nathan first fought him, when they called him, I said, 'look, he's got to be on some kind of steroids or substance.'\"\n\n\"And when Nathan asked, he got really upset about it. If it had been me, I would have been laughing about it. I would have been like 'yeah steroids, yeah, yeah,' but he was really mad, he was angry. So that speaks for itself right there. Mayweather and them really need to have that guy checked.\"\n\n\"After the last fight, I read it, it's not steroids, it's something that bulks you up, I forget what it's called. It's illegal, still you can't use it in the UFC, even in boxing you can't use it. So I guess now that's why they're both being tested every week. I'm not sure how true that is.\"\n\nHard to know what to make of all of this given the sheer lunacy of this allegations but, of course, given the turbulent history that these two fighters share, perhaps it may well be best to take this one with a pinch of salt.", "id": "9830357", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nate Diaz's Coach Makes Bizarre Substance Abuse Allegations Towards Conor McGregor", "image": "http://www.punditarena.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/830577092-1.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Muscle"}, "id": "302851", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boxing"}, "id": "303320", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}, "id": "310320", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}, "id": "327224", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}, "id": "329431", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}, "id": "333005", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}, "id": "333008", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}, "id": "343675", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}, "id": "347122", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight"}, {"label": {"eng": "Octagon"}, "id": "382893", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octagon"}, {"label": {"eng": "UFC 196"}, "id": "1284334", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_196"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 358, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 795, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 898, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 899, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1413, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1620, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction"}], "time": "19:14:00"}

An aggressive southpaw, he rarely goes to ground and wrestles in his MMA bouts by choice.\n\nHowever, the reigning UFC Lightweight champion does have some grounding in martial arts.\n\n\"I'll train in any style. I always love to learn,\" he told SBNation in 2013. \"I always look at everything. I spend all day looking at videos, or in the gym working on the things that I've seen.\n\n\"I started out doing some kickboxing and boxing, then a little Capoeira, Tae Kwon Do and Karate. The human body can move in many ways, and that's what I'm trying to do.\"\n\nAfter his first-round stoppage of American featherweight Dustin Poirier in 2014, McGregor was promoted to a brown belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by his coach John Kavanagh - himself a black belt in the discipline, and the first Irishman to attain that level of expertise.\n\nBrazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) is based around enabling even a smaller, weaker fighter being able to defend themselves against a heavier, stronger opponent by levering them to the ground before employing joint locks (manipulating an opponent's arm or leg joint into a position where they are forced to submit) or choke-holds (which can cause the opponent to pass out) to claim the victory.\n\nMcGregor's BJJ skills are a hotly debated subject in MMA circles. All three of his UFC defeats have come by submission to superior ground fighters - he has only forced one submission himself - with the most recent and notable loss coming against Nate Diaz at UFC 196, where a rear-naked choke (as unpleasant as it sounds) proved decisive.\n\nMayweather won't represent a threat in that sense, of course, but that much-lauded punching ability of the rank outsider

As the fans already know, McGregor (0-0) is a novice in the sport of boxing, as he's never fought inside of a ring before. His experience is limited to MMA, which is entirely different from boxing.\n\nMcGregor is a good fighter in that realm of combat, but he's still going to be over his head inside of a boxing ring against a fighter like Floyd in their high priced fight on Showtime PPV at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\"When a fighter has been dominating for 20-some years and never lost, everything is on the line,\" said Mayweather to skysports.com. \"My legacy. My boxing record. Everything is on the line.\"\n\nMayweather's legacy is always been on the line. It's not just for his fight against the novice McGregor. It's been on the line for years now. It obviously helps Mayweather ensure that his legacy isn't tarnished by him fighting a guy with no experience in the sport. When you handpick someone that has never boxed in their life, I think you can feel pretty safe that you're not going to have your precious legacy tarnished. Mayweather's legacy would be at a much higher risk if he fought someone in his own sport like Gennady Golovkin, who has volunteered to drop down to 154 to fight him. Mayweather fought Saul Canelo Alvarez at a 152 lb. catch-weight in 2013. Golovkin is willing to drop down to 154 to fight Mayweather. If Mayweather wants to brag about how he's taking such a great risk by fighting McGregor, he should take an even greater risk by fighting Golovkin, Keith Thurman or Errol Spence Jr. If you're a great tennis player, would you be worried about your legacy if someone from basketball was put on the tennis court to play you? I think it's a joke the way that Mayweather is complaining about his legacy being at risk against McGregor.\n\n\"It's all about taking risk,\" said Mayweather in calling his fight against McGregor a risk. \"I wouldn't be where I'm at if I didn't take risks so I don't mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight.\"\n\nThere are a lot of risks Mayweather didn't take in his career. He never fought Antonio Margarito when he was knocking everyone out. He never fought Kostya Tszyu, Keith Thurman, Spence Jr., Shawn Porter or Paul Williams. For the fans that don't remember how dominant Paul Williams was at welterweight. He couldn't get a fight against Mayweather. Yes, Mayweather fought Canelo, but the Mexican fighter was only 22 at the time, and he had to boil down to 152 to fight at a catch-weight to give Mayweather a handicap. Mayweather didn't fight Manny Pacquiao until he was 36-years-old and clearly past his prime years. Why didn't Mayweather take the risk of fighting Manny when he was at his best in 2009? When you make careful decisions to fight guys that you know you can beat, you can't say that your legacy is truly on the line. Mayweather never took the real risks with his career that you see other fighters make on a routine basis.\n\nI think Mayweather's career is more about careful match-making than about the risks he took. He was very careful in picking the right guy at the right time in his career. If Mayweather fought Canelo right now, I think it's pretty clear that he would be knocked out. Canelo would get to Mayweather eventually and knock him out like he did Amir Khan. Golovkin would be the same result for Mayweather. Why isn't he taking risks against him? Mayweather is fighting McGregor at 154. Golovkin has volunteered to fight Mayweather at 154. There's no excuse for why Mayweather doesn't take that risk, is there?\n\n\"Experience wise, it leans towards me, period, because I have been in the ring at such a high level for so long,\" said Mayweather.\n\nIt goes without saying that Mayweather has more experience than McGregor in boxing. An amateur can say they have more experience than McGregor in boxing. I'm not sure why Mayweather is even bothering to mention his advantage in experience. He's been boxing since he was 5-years-old. He fought in the Olympics for the U.S, and he captured 5 division world titles as a pro. Why would Mayweather even need to talk about his advantage in experience of McGregor? Even the casual boxing fans that have scant knowledge about the sport recognize that Mayweather is the one with the experience on his side and McGregor just the victim that is being pulled in from the UFC for Mayweather to look good against. This is not a fair fight without a handicap for McGregor. Unless Mayweather purposefully stays in 1st gear the entire fight, he's going to clown McGregor and beat him badly. That's the only logical conclusion for this fight.\n\nHopefully, the sport of boxing isn't going to degrade into back and forth mismatches between MMA fighters and boxers in the future. I don't think it's fair to the fans of either sport to have these events setup. I guess it's new for the casual fans that don't remember what has happened in the past when fighters move from their sport into MMA and vice versa. The fans will find out through repetition that these fights will always end in mismatches. Mayweather is lucky that the boxing and MMA fans don't realize how bad this fight will be. I think they'll be kicking themselves afterwards for having paid $99 to order the Mayweather-McGregor fight on PPV. Unfortunately the Mayweather-McGregor undercard is not good enough to justify paying huge money for the mismatch in the main event. For the undercard, you've got Badou Jack fighting WBA light heavyweight champion Nathan Cleverly, who is the secondary WBA champion. The main champion is Andre Ward. The World Boxing Association has 2 champions at 164.

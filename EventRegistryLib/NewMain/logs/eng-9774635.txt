He's being reckless. They're worried,' the source shared Tuesday.\n\nPax -- who like several of his other siblings is estranged from his famous father -- had reportedly been driving down Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m., which put him on the regularly crowded street during rush hour traffic.\n\nAccording to law enforcement sources, he had been coming up to an intersection when he crashed his bike into the back of the car, which had already stopped for the red light.\n\nThe car's driver reportedly did their duty by getting out and checking on the injured Pax before police and paramedics arrived.\n\nAlthough it's not clear exactly where he collided with the car, witnesses at the scene said he complained of pain in his hip, and they said he appeared to have injured his head in the crash.\n\nFirst responders were reportedly concerned that Pax may have been suffered from bleeding to the brain, so they rushed him to a hospital in case of the worst.\n\nHowever, sources later told TMZ that Pax was in stable condition after being hospitalized, though the full extent of his injuries isn't yet clear.\n\nHowever, they added that he might be able to go home on Monday night, just hours after the crash.\n\nIn recent months, Pax has been spotted around Los Angeles riding on a Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike, which costs around $3,000, though it's not known if that was the same bike he crashed.\n\nAngelina rushed to the hospital to be by her son's beside, where he is currently in stable condition; seen in 2021\n\nAs for Pax's estranged father Brad Pitt, a rep for the 60-year-old actor declined to comment when asked by DailyMail.com if he planned to visit his son in hospital; seen in February\n\nHe was most recently pictured on the dirt bike on July 11.\n\nNotably, he wasn't wearing a helmet when he was pictured riding the bike in public.\n\nCalifornia state laws require all bike and motorcycle riders under 18 to wear helmets, but it's unclear if the type of bike Pax was riding at the time would have required him to wear a helmet.\n\nHe and he and his mother Angelina had a rare public sighting two days later when they went out for Japanese food at the celebrity hotspot Sushi Park in West Hollywood.\n\nIn addition to Pax, who was adopted by Jolie in Vietnam in 2007 at age three, she and her ex Brad share five other children: Maddox, 22; Zahara, 19; Shiloh, 18; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16.\n\nJolie adopted Maddox in Cambodia in 2002, and later adopted Zahara in 2005 in Ethiopia, while Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne are their biological children.\n\nPitt later joined her in adopting Maddox and Zahara in 2006, and Pax in 2008.\n\nPitt and Jolie began dating publicly shortly after he and his then-wife Jennifer Aniston announced their divorce in 2005.\n\nThe Mr. And Mrs. Smith costars remained unmarried for years despite having multiple adopted and biological children together, but they got engaged in 2012 and finally tied the knot in 2014.\n\nHowever, the Maleficent actress filed for divorce in 2016. She and Pitt were declared legally single in 2019.\n\nThe two A-listers have since been embroiled in an ongoing divorce battle over assets and custody for years.\n\nA central issue seems to be a notorious private jet confrontation in 2016.\n\nA source told TMZ on Tuesday that witnesses initially believed the 20-year-old had died in the crash as they discovered him lying on the ground lifeless; Pax and Angie seen in 2023\n\nIt was not until paramedics arrived at the scene that Pax regained consciousness; Pax and Angie seen in 2018\n\nAccording to an FBI report on the incident, which was published in 2022, Jolie accused Pitt of physical assault after a flight to California in 2016.\n\nShe claimed that he was intoxicated and that he grabbed her by the head and shook her, and later pushed her down, as part of a confrontation allegedly related to their children.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Jolie said Pitt told the children that she was 'f***ing up this family,' and she claimed he punched the ceiling of the airplane four times.\n\nShe also alleged that at one point he poured beer on her and a blanket she was under with multiple children.\n\nSource close to Pitt later claimed that he never hit any of the children, though they admitted he had been drinking.\n\nThe Once Upon A Time In Hollywood star reportedly had to be supervised by the children's caretakers and a therapist during family visitations in the wake of the jet incident.\n\nThe latest signs of estrangement between Pitt and his children came in May.\n\nHis youngest daughter Vivienne, who had worked as Jolie's assistant when she produced the Broadway musical adaptation of The Outsiders, listed her name as Vivienne Jolie in the show's program -- rather than using her what was previously listed as her name -- Vivienne Jolie-Pitt -- though it's unclear if she may have changed it legally.\n\nLater that month, his daughter Shiloh filed a legal request to drop his last name from her own name after she turned 18.\n\nHowever, a clerical error in the court's background-check procedure led to a delay in a hearing on the request, People reported on Monday.\n\nIn addition to Pax, Angelina and her ex Brad share five other children: Maddox, 22; Zahara, 19 (not pictured); Shiloh, 18; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16 (not pictured); Pax, Shiloh and Maddox are seen with Brad and his parents in 2014 in Hollywood\n\nPitt and Jolie married in 2014 but filed for divorce two years later. He has been estranged from Pax and his other children since a 2016 incident on a private jet in which Jolie claimed in an FBI report that he had assaulted her while drunk; pictured July 26 in Belgium\n\nIn November 2023, Zahara shouted out her name as 'Zahara Marley Jolie' at her Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority introduction ceremony at Spelman College, excising 'Pitt' from her last name.\n\nFollowing the latest round of children appearing to remove Pitt's name from their own, it was reported that the oldest boys Pax and Maddox had not been using the hyphenated name in years, though it's unknown if they have legally changed their names.\n\nAs Pax and his three oldest siblings are all over 18, they are not required to have regular visitation with Pitt, though his minor children Knox and Vivienne are.\n\nIn May, a source close to the Oscar winner told DailyMail.com that he hopes to 'rekindle' his relationship with his children, and they claimed their bond was 'broken by the divorce.'\n\nThe source also accused Jolie of ensuring that their children had 'limited involvement' with their father.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

driving down Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m., which put him on the regularly crowded street during rush hour traffic.\n\nAccording to law enforcement sources, he had been coming up to an intersection when he crashed his bike into the back of the car, which had already stopped for the red light.\n\nThe car's driver reportedly did their duty by getting out and checking on the injured Pax before police and paramedics arrived.\n\nAlthough it's not clear exactly where he collided with the car, witnesses at the scene said he complained of pain in his hip, and they said he appeared to have injured his head in the crash.\n\nFirst responders were reportedly concerned that Pax may have been suffered from bleeding to the brain, so they rushed him to a hospital in case of the worst.\n\nHowever, sources later told TMZ that Pax was in stable condition after being hospitalized, though the full extent of his injuries isn't yet clear.\n\nHowever, they added that he might be able to go home on Monday night, just hours after the crash.\n\nIn recent months, Pax has been spotted around Los Angeles riding on a Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike, which costs around $3,000, though it's not known if that was the same bike he crashed.\n\nHe was most recently pictured on the dirt bike on July 11.\n\nNotably, he wasn't wearing a helmet when he was pictured riding the bike in public.\n\nCalifornia state laws require all bike and motorcycle riders under 18 to wear helmets, but it's unclear if the type of bike Pax was riding at the time would have required him to wear a helmet.\n\nHe and he and his mother Angelina had a rare public sighting two days later when they went out for Japanese food at the celebrity hotspot Sushi Park in West Hollywood.\n\nIn addition to Pax, who was adopted by Jolie in Vietnam in 2007 at age three, she and her ex Brad share five other children: Maddox, 22; Zahara, 19; Shiloh, 18; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16.\n\nJolie adopted Maddox in Cambodia in 2002, and later adopted Zahara in 2005 in Ethiopia, while Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne are their biological children.\n\nPitt later joined her in adopting Maddox and Zahara in 2006, and Pax in 2008.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television",

She and Pitt were declared legally single in 2019.\n\nThe two A-listers have since been embroiled in an ongoing divorce battle over assets and custody for years.\n\nA central issue seems to be a notorious private jet confrontation in 2016.\n\nAccording to an FBI report on the incident, which was published in 2022, Jolie accused Pitt of physical assault after a flight to California in 2016.\n\nShe claimed that he was intoxicated and that he grabbed her by the head and shook her, and later pushed her down, as part of a confrontation allegedly related to their children.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Jolie said Pitt told the children that she was 'f***ing up this family,' and she claimed he punched the ceiling of the airplane four times.\n\nShe also alleged that at one point he poured beer on her and a blanket she was under with multiple children.\n\nSource close to Pitt later claimed that he never hit any of the children, though they admitted he had been drinking.\n\nThe Once Upon A Time In Hollywood star reportedly had to be supervised by the children's caretakers and a therapist during family visitations in the wake of the jet incident.\n\nThe latest signs of estrangement between Pitt and his children came in May.\n\nHis youngest daughter Vivienne, who had worked as Jolie's assistant when she produced the Broadway musical adaptation of The Outsiders, listed her name as Vivienne Jolie in the show's program -- rather than using her what was previously listed as her name -- Vivienne Jolie-Pitt -- though it's unclear if she may have changed it legally.\n\nLater that month, his daughter Shiloh filed a legal request to drop his last name from her own name after she turned 18.\n\nHowever, a clerical error in the court's background-check procedure led to a delay in a hearing on the request, People reported on Monday.\n\nIn addition to Pax, she and her ex Brad share five other children: Maddox, 22; Zahara, 19 (not pictured); Shiloh, 18; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16 (not pictured); Pax, Shiloh and Maddox are seen with Brad and his parents in 2014 in Hollywood\n\nPitt and Jolie married in 2014 but filed for divorce two years later.

Belgium\n\nIn November 2023, Zahara shouted out her name as 'Zahara Marley Jolie' at her Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority introduction ceremony at Spelman College, excising 'Pitt' from her last name.\n\nFollowing the latest round of children appearing to remove Pitt's name from their own, it was reported that the oldest boys Pax and Maddox had not been using the hyphenated name in years, though it's unknown if they have legally changed their names.\n\nAs Pax and his three oldest siblings are all over 18, they are not required to have regular visitation with Pitt, though his minor children Knox and Vivienne are.\n\nIn May, a source close to the Oscar winner told DailyMail.com that he hopes to 'rekindle' his relationship with his children, and they claimed their bond was 'broken by the divorce.'\n\nThe source also accused Jolie of ensuring that their children had 'limited involvement' with their father.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

They're worried,' the source shared Tuesday.\n\nPax -- who like several of his other siblings is estranged from his famous father -- had reportedly been driving down Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m., which put him on the regularly crowded street during rush hour traffic.\n\nAccording to law enforcement sources, he had been coming up to an intersection when he crashed his bike into the back of the car, which had already stopped for the red light.\n\nThe car's driver reportedly did their duty by getting out and checking on the injured Pax before police and paramedics arrived.\n\nAlthough it's not clear exactly where he collided with the car, witnesses at the scene said he complained of pain in his hip, and they said he appeared to have injured his head in the crash.\n\nFirst responders were reportedly concerned that Pax may have been suffered from bleeding to the brain, so they rushed him to a hospital in case of the worst.\n\nHowever, sources later told TMZ that Pax was in stable condition after being hospitalized, though the full extent of his injuries isn't yet clear.\n\nHowever, they added that he might be able to go home on Monday night, just hours after the crash.\n\nIn recent months, Pax has been spotted around Los Angeles riding on a Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike, which costs around $3,000, though it's not known if that was the same bike he crashed.\n\nHe was most recently pictured on the dirt bike on July 11.\n\nNotably, he wasn't wearing a helmet when he was pictured riding the bike in public.\n\nCalifornia state laws require all bike and motorcycle riders under 18 to wear helmets, but it's unclear if the type of bike Pax was riding at the time would have required him to wear a helmet.\n\nHe and he and his mother Angelina had a rare public sighting two days later when they went out for Japanese food at the celebrity hotspot Sushi Park in West Hollywood.\n\nIn addition to Pax, who was adopted by Jolie in Vietnam in 2007 at age three, she and her ex Brad share five other children: Maddox, 22; Zahara, 19; Shiloh, 18; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16.\n\nJolie adopted Maddox in Cambodia in 2002, and later adopted Zahara in 2005 in Ethiopia, while Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne are their biological children.\n\nPitt later joined her in adopting Maddox and Zahara in 2006, and Pax in 2008.\n\nPitt and Jolie began dating publicly shortly after he and his then-wife Jennifer Aniston announced their divorce in 2005.\n\nThe Mr. And Mrs. Smith costars remained unmarried for years despite having multiple adopted and biological children together, but they got engaged in 2012 and finally tied the knot in 2014.\n\nHowever, the Maleficent actress filed for divorce in 2016. She and Pitt were declared legally single in 2019.\n\nThe two A-listers have since been embroiled in an ongoing divorce battle over assets and custody for years.\n\nA central issue seems to be a notorious private jet confrontation in 2016.\n\nAccording to an FBI report on the incident, which was published in 2022, Jolie accused Pitt of physical assault after a flight to California in 2016.\n\nShe claimed that he was intoxicated and that he grabbed her by the head and shook her, and later pushed her down, as part of a confrontation allegedly related to their children.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Jolie said Pitt told the children that she was 'f***ing up this family,' and she claimed he punched the ceiling of the airplane four times.\n\nShe also alleged that at one point he poured beer on her and a blanket she was under with multiple children.\n\nSource close to Pitt later claimed that he never hit any of the children, though they admitted he had been drinking.\n\nThe Once Upon A Time In Hollywood star reportedly had to be supervised by the children's caretakers and a therapist during family visitations in the wake of the jet incident.\n\nThe latest signs of estrangement between Pitt and his children came in May.\n\nHis youngest daughter Vivienne, who had worked as Jolie's assistant when she produced the Broadway musical adaptation of The Outsiders, listed her name as Vivienne Jolie in the show's program -- rather than using her what was previously listed as her name -- Vivienne Jolie-Pitt -- though it's unclear if she may have changed it legally.\n\nLater that month, his daughter Shiloh filed a legal request to drop his last name from her own name after she turned 18.\n\nHowever, a clerical error in the court's background-check procedure led to a delay in a hearing on the request, People reported on Monday.\n\nIn November 2023, Zahara shouted out her name as 'Zahara Marley Jolie' at her Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority introduction ceremony at Spelman College, excising 'Pitt' from her last name.\n\nFollowing the latest round of children appearing to remove Pitt's name from their own, it was reported that the oldest boys Pax and Maddox had not been using the hyphenated name in years, though it's unknown if they have legally changed their names.\n\nAs Pax and his three oldest siblings are all over 18, they are not required to have regular visitation with Pitt, though his minor children Knox and Vivienne are.\n\nIn May, a source close to the Oscar winner told DailyMail.com that he hopes to 'rekindle' his relationship with his children, and they claimed their bond was 'broken by the divorce.'\n\nThe source also accused Jolie of ensuring that their children had 'limited involvement' with their father.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com",

He was involved in an accident involving his electric bike and a stopped car. But what happened, exactly? Upon medical officials' arrival at the scene, Pax was taken to the hospital to be treated and monitored.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Pax crashed into a car during heavy traffic while he was riding his electric bike with no helmet. When paramedics arrived on the scene, Pax was conscious, but he was taken to the hospital to be treated for a potential brain injury and for other pain related to the crash. The accident could have been a lot more serious, but Pax did sustain some injuries that could be cause for concern.\n\nThe outlet also reported that, although Pax was stable at the time he was taken to the hospital, one fear that medical officials had was a brain bleed, as Pax was reported to have not been wearing a helmet at the time of his crash. Riding without a helmet appears to be nothing new for Pax. He has been seen on the streets of Los Angeles numerous times on his bike without a helmet on.\n\nWhile there aren't laws about individuals over the age of 18 wearing helmets on the road for traditional bicycles or even Class 1 or Class 1 e-bikes, it's possible that Pax was riding his Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike. However, it hasn't been confirmed if that's the bike he was riding at the time. The Talara is considered to be a moped, which does require riders to wear helmets, especially on open city streets.\n\nWhile Pax is recovering from is seemingly non-life threatening injuries following his crash, there is still plenty of curiosity surrounding his five siblings. At 20, Pax is the second oldest child to Angelina and Brad, with older brother Maddox Jolie-Pitt being the eldest child in the family at almost 23.\n\nZahara Jolie is 19 and left home for college in Spelman College in Atlanta, Ga., in 2023. She also quietly dropped the 'Pitt' from her name. 18-year-old Shiloh Jolie-Pitt also has plans to remove her father's name from her hyphenated last name, though a hearing for that removal was postponed as of July 29, 2024. Twins Vivienne and Knox Jolie-Pitt turned 16 in 2024. But it looks like they, too have plans, for a name change. Or, at the very least, Vivienne does.\n\nWhen Vivienne helped Angelina on a Broadway production of The Outsiders and her name was credited in the Playbill, it was reportedly written as Vivienne Jolie, without Brad's last name tacked onto the end. In fact, there are reports that Brad has very little contact with his kids at this time. No word yet on if Brad appeared at the hospital following Pax's accident.", "source": {"uri": "distractify.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Distractify"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chrissy_bobic@distractify.com", "name": "Chrissy Bobic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classes of United States senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traumatic brain injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracerebral_hemorrhage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intracerebral hemorrhage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sting (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moped", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Talara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelman_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spelman College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playbill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.distractify.com/brand-img/RT9BjuAf7/1200x628/pax-jolie-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-1722336964578.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

bicycle into a car in Los Angeles on Monday.\n\nAccording to celebrity and entertainment news outlet TMZ, the 20-year-old was riding on Los Feliz Blvd during the evening rush hour when the crash occurred.\n\nAs he approached a red light, he rammed into the back of a car that stopped at the intersection, law enforcement sources said.\n\nTMZ reported that the driver of the car got out of the vehicle to check on Pax, who was not wearing a helmet.\n\nWith police and paramedics at the scene, witnesses reported that Pax was experiencing hip pain and also had a head injury.\n\nHe was taken to a hospital in LA for treatment where medics feared that he suffered a minor brain bleed.\n\nHowever, latest reports said that he is stable and may be released from the hospital later in the night.\n\nThe fourth child of Angelina and Brad's six children, Pax has been seen cruising the streets of LA on a BMX-style e-bike, without a helmet.\n\nIn the state of California, helmet laws vary depending on the class of bicycle.\n\nIt is unclear if a helmet was required for the particular bike Pax was riding.\n\nPax has had minor acting roles, including a voice-over part in Kung Fu Panda 3 and an uncredited appearance in his mother's film, Maleficent.\n\nAngelina's representatives have not yet replied to requests for comment.", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news",

I don't know a ton about his life these days, but from what I can tell, he's super-close to Angelina Jolie, he's worked behind-the-scenes on several of her films (including Maria and Without Blood), he often walks around like he's his mother's main bodyguard and he despises Brad Pitt. When Angelina is in New York, Pax is almost always with her. When Angelina is in LA, Pax is almost always with her. Well, in recent months, Pax has been seen zipping around LA on an electric bicycle. On Monday, he crashed into a car which was stopped at a red light.\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's son, Pax Jolie-Pitt, is one lucky guy after police say he smashed his electric bicycle into a car on a busy L.A. street ... TMZ has learned. The 20-year-old was riding Monday on Los Feliz Blvd. around 5 PM -- so, rush hour on a heavily trafficked street -- and as he approached a red light, he rammed into the back of a car stopped at the intersection ... according to law enforcement sources.\n\nWe're told the driver of the car got out to check on Pax, who was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident. Police and paramedics arrived on the scene, and witnesses tell us Pax was experiencing hip pain, and had apparently suffered a head injury ... so, he was rushed to an L.A. hospital for treatment.\n\nWe're told medics feared he suffered a minor brain bleed in the wreck, but the latest word is that Pax is stable, and might be able to go home sometime tonight.\n\nPax -- the 4th of Angelina and Brad's 6 kids -- has been seen recently cruising around L.A. on a BMX-style e-bike, and almost always without a helmet.\n\nCalifornia helmet laws differ depending on the class of bicycle ... so, it's unclear if he needs one with that particular ride. What is clear, is a helmet would've come in handy during today's accident.\n\n[From TMZ]\n\nYeah, Angelina Jolie loves motorcycles, planes and anything that can go fast, so Pax comes by it naturally.

The 20-year-old celebrity was riding his electric bike in Los Angeles when he collided with the rear of a car, according to law enforcement sources who spoke to TMZ.\n\nPolice and paramedics decided to take him to the hospital after he complained of severe head pain. He was not wearing a helmet during the incident. Pax, who, like some of his siblings, is estranged from his famous father, was reportedly riding down Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m., on the often-congested street during rush hour.\n\nHorror Motorcycle Crash\n\nAccording to law enforcement sources, Pax was approaching an intersection when he collided with the rear of a car that had already stopped for a red light. The driver of the car reportedly stepped out to check on Pax before the arrival of police and paramedics.\n\nWhile the exact point of impact is unclear, witnesses at the scene noted that Pax complained of hip pain and appeared to have sustained a head injury in the crash.\n\nFirst responders were concerned about potential brain bleeding, leading them to quickly transport him to the hospital as a precaution.\n\nLater, TMZ reported that Pax's condition was stable after hospitalization, although the full extent of his injuries remains unclear. It was also mentioned that he might be discharged as early as Monday night, just hours after the accident.\n\nRecently, Pax has been seen riding a Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike, valued around $3,000, in Los Angeles. It is not known if this was the same bike involved in the crash. He was last photographed on the dirt bike on July 11.\n\nSaved Despite Not Wearing Helmet\n\nNotably, Pax was not wearing a helmet when he was seen riding the bike in public. California state laws mandate that all cyclists and motorcyclists under 18 must wear helmets, though it's unclear if the specific type of bike Pax was using at the time required him to wear one.\n\nTwo days after the incident, Pax and his mother, Angelina Jolie, were spotted together at the celebrity hotspot Sushi Park in West Hollywood, enjoying a Japanese meal.\n\nPax, who was adopted by Jolie from Vietnam in 2007 at age three, is one of six children she shares with her ex, Brad Pitt. Their other children include Maddox, 22; Zahara, 19; Shiloh, 18; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16.\n\nJolie adopted Maddox from Cambodia in 2002, Zahara from Ethiopia in 2005, and she and Pitt later adopted Pax in 2008. Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne are their biological children.\n\nPitt and Jolie's public relationship began shortly after his divorce from Jennifer Aniston in 2005. Despite having several children together, they remained unmarried until their engagement in 2012 and their marriage in 2014.\n\nHowever, the Maleficent actress filed for divorce in 2016, and she and Pitt were legally declared single in 2019. Since then, the high-profile couple has been entangled in a prolonged divorce dispute over assets and custody.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

According to Page Six, citing TMZ, Pax sustained a head injury in the crash on July 29 and was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\nSources close to the incident revealed that Pax was approaching an intersection when he collided with another vehicle that was stationary at a red light. The other driver, concerned for Pax's well-being, promptly exited their vehicle to check on him before emergency services arrived on the scene.\n\nFortunately, Pax is now in stable condition and is expected to be discharged from the hospital soon, much to the relief of his family and fans.\n\nPax is one of six children shared by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. The ex-couple, who finalized their divorce in April 2019, also share Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 17, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 15. While Maddox, Zahara, and Pax were adopted, Shiloh and the twins were born to Jolie and Pitt. Shiloh was born in Namibia in May 2006, and the twins were welcomed into the family in July 2008.\n\nIn recent months, the Jolie-Pitt family has been in the spotlight for another reason. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, who turned 18 on May 27, made headlines by legally dropping her father's surname. Sources close to the family disclosed to People magazine that Shiloh's decision to change her last name was influenced by her desire to assert her independence. The decision reportedly stems from Angelina Jolie's allegations of an \"abuse history\" within the family, prompting Shiloh to distance herself legally from her father.\n\nThe Jolie-Pitt family has faced numerous public challenges and personal struggles over the years, but they continue to navigate their lives with resilience and strength. Pax's recent accident is a reminder of the unpredictability of life, but his recovery is a testament to his resilience.\n\nFans of the family are undoubtedly relieved to hear that Pax is on the mend and wish him a swift and complete recovery. As Pax recovers, the support from his family, friends, and fans will undoubtedly provide him with the strength he needs during this challenging time.", "source": {"uri": "liveindia.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Live India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "appteam@liveindia.tv", "name": "appteam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercouple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercouple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://liveindia.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Angelina-Jolie-and-Brad-Pitts-Son-Pax-Hospitalized-After-Accident.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 255, "textEnd": 262}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-27", "textStart": 1285, "textEnd": 1291}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 878, "textEnd": 888}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-05-", "textStart": 1094, "textEnd": 1102}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-07-", "textStart": 1151, "textEnd": 1160}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Child - Internewscast Journal", "body": "PAX Thien Jolie-Pitt was adopted by Hollywood stars Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt from Vietnam in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is said to be in a stable condition but the full extent of injuries has not been revealed yet.\n\nHe was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash.\n\nPax was seen riding a Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike around Los Angeles just days before the collision.\n\nHowever, it's not been made clear if it is the same bike that was involved in the accident.\n\nHere's everything we know about Pax's life, career and family relations.\n\nWho is Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt?\n\nPax Thien Jolie-Pitt, 20, was born on November 29, 2003 in Pham Quang Sang, Vietnam.\n\nHis biological mother - who was battling addiction - abandoned him when he was only two days old after discovering he had liver problems.\n\nHe was later placed at the Tam Binh Orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nPax was adopted by Angelina Jolie from the Vietnamese orphanage in 2007.\n\nPax has a number of siblings, although not biologically related.\n\nThis includes Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and 16-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.\n\nHe also has a 22-year-old older brother, Maddox.\n\nJolie took middle son Pax as her guest to the Golden Globes in 2018 as a way to spend quality time with him.\n\nShe told Vogue in 2021 that she had left Pitt, 59, \"for the wellbeing\" of her family.\n\nJolie initially took full custody of their six children, but a new arrangement in 2021 allowed them to spend 50 per cent of their time with Pitt.\n\nHowever the decision was revoked after it turned out that the judge on the case had close business relations with Pitt.\n\nSince then, the pair have gone back and forth over custody and visitation rights.\n\nSince their divorce, the two have also become embroiled in a bitter legal court battle for their $350 million France vineyard.\n\nJolie initiated the divorce process in 2016, which occurred two years after their marriage and shortly after news emerged of a confrontation between Pitt and Pax's older brother Maddox on a private airplane.\n\nAccusations that Pitt had been consuming alcohol and Maddox had defended his mother in an argument prompted investigations by the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services.\n\nWhile Brad reportedly maintains a positive relationship with his twins, an inside source revealed that Maddox, Pax, and Zahara have not yet resolved their issues with their father.\n\nPax branded his estranged father \"a world-class a**hole\" in a scathing post on Father's day in 2020.\n\n\"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person.\"\n\nWhat movies has Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt appeared in?\n\nPax has made his own mark in the world into the movie world, voicing the character of Yoo on Kung Fu Panda 3.\n\nHe was also a set photographer on Jolie's film - First They Killed My Father in August 2022.\n\nDetailing working with Pax and Maddox on various film sets, Jolie told People: \"We work well together.\n\n\"When a film crew is at its best, it feels like a big family, so it felt natural.\"\n\nWhere did Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt go to college and did he graduate?\n\nPax graduated from a prestigious LA private school in 2021, but opted not to go as he did not want to make a \"circus\" of the event.\n\nEarlier this year, Pax reportedly become an artist - creating work under the pseudonym \"Embtto\" - but the story turned out to be a hoax.\n\nPax seemingly keeps a great deal of his personal life out of the public eye.",

Law enforcement sources told TMZ that the accident happened on Los Feliz Boulevard at around 5pm, during peak traffic times, with the driver getting out of the car to check on Pax.\n\nPolice and paramedics arrived to check over Pax, who was allegedly not wearing a helmet at the time. Witnesses claimed that Pax was struggling with hip pain and had suffered a head injury, so he was taken to a hospital nearby.\n\nIt has been reported that medical staff were worried he had a minor bleed on the brain, but he is said to be stable now and may be able to go home this evening. Pax has been trying his hand at acting, having a voiceover role in Kung Fu Panda 3 as well as Maleficent.\n\nBack in 2023, it was revealed that Pax Jolie-Pitt allegedly wrote a scathing Father's Day message for Brad in 2020. On his Instagram Story at the time, he is said to have shared a picture of Brad receiving an Oscar for his role in Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood. Around the photo, Pax is said to have posted a lengthy rant dedicated towards the Fight Club actor. \"Happy Father's Day to this world class a*****e!! You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person,\" the post apparently read.\n\n\"You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence. You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you are incapable of doing so.\"\n\nHe added: \"You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday. So, Happy Father's Day, you f*****g awful human being!!!\"\n\nAngelina Jolie adopted Pax in 2007 from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam when he was three-years-old. A year later, Brad formally adopted Pax but the pair have reportedly had a troubled relationship for a number of years now.\n\n*Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmine_allday@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jasmine Allday", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kung Fu Panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maleficent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Once Upon a Time (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article33310836.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_bpaj_main.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Pax labeled Brad as a \"world class a*****e\" and that he was a bad and careless parent in the passage. He was upset about how Brad affected their family and said that Brad had made their lives a \"constant hell\" for those who were closest to him.\n\nAngelina Jolie adopted Pax from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2007 when he was three years old.

He was believed to have not been wearing a helmet at the time.\n\nPax -- who is estranged from Angelina's ex-husband Brad Pitt -- had been driving down Los Feliz Boulevard at approximately 5pm on Monday, which was particularly crowded due to rush hour traffic.\n\nLaw enforcement officers who attended the scene stated that the 20-year-old had been approaching an intersection when he crashed his electric bike into the rear of a vehicle which had already stopped.\n\nIt is understood that the driver of the car left their vehicle to check on the injured Pax before Police and paramedics arrived to take over.\n\nWitnesses to the incident said that Pax was complaining of pain and appeared to have head injuries from the collision.\n\nFirst Responders are believed to have been concerned that Pax may have suffered a bleed on his brain as a result of the accident, which has left him recovering in hospital.\n\nAccording to TMZ News, sources confirmed that Pax was in a stable condition following his hospitalisation, despite the full extent of his injuries being unclear at this time.\n\nIn recent months, the celebrity son has been spotted riding around Los Angeles on a Talaria Sting R MX4 e-bike, which retails at around $3,000 (\u20ac2,771).\n\nIt hasn't been confirmed if this was the vehicle he was operating at the time of the crash.\n\nRecent images from earlier in the month showed that Pax had not been wearing a helmet when snapped riding the pricey bike on July 11 around Los Angeles.\n\nCalifornia state laws require all bike and motorcycle riders under 18 to wear helmets, but it's unclear if the type of bike Pax was riding at the time would have required him to wear a helmet.\n\nJust days after the images were released, Pax and his mum Angelina were spotted in a rare public appearance when they enjoyed a Japanese meal at celebrity hotspot Sushi Park in West Hollywood.\n\nIn addition to Pax, who was adopted by Jolie in Vietnam in 2007 at age three, she and her ex-husband Brad share five other children: Maddox, 22; Zahara, 19; Shiloh, 18; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16.\n\nJolie adopted Maddox in Cambodia in 2002 and later adopted Zahara in 2005 in Ethiopia, while Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne are their biological children.\n\nPitt later joined her in adopting Maddox and Zahara in 2006 and Pax in 2008.\n\nPitt and Jolie began dating publicly shortly after his split from then-wife and Friends actress Jennifer Aniston, with the Mr and Mrs Smith costars remaining unmarried for a number of years.\n\nIn 2012 the pair announced their engagement with them finally tying the knot in 2014.\n\nHowever, their marriage was short-lived, with Jolie filing for divorce in 2016 and the pair both becoming legally single in 2019.\n\nThe A-listers have been embroiled in an ongoing divorce battle over assets and custody for a number of years, with the notorious private jet confrontation remaining forefront of their proceedings.\n\nAccording to an FBI report on the incident, which was published in 2022, 49-year-old Jolie accused Pitt, 60, of physically assaulting her after a flight to California in 2016.\n\nThe confrontation was believed to have concerned their children. According to the FBI, Jolie said Pitt told the children that she was 'f***ing up this family,' claiming that he punched the ceiling of the airplane four times.\n\nShe also alleged that the Fight Club Actor poured beer on her and a blanket she was under with multiple of their children -- sources close to Pitt later confirmed that he never assaulted any of his children, though admitted he had been drinking during the incident.\n\nThe pair's youngest daughter, Vivienne, who worked for her mother as her assistant when she produced the Broadway musical adaption of The Outsiders, listed her name as Vivienne Jolie in the show's programme -- rather than using what had been previously listed as her name -- Vivienne Jolie-Pitt -- though it remains unclear if she has changed it legally.\n\nLater that month, his daughter Shiloh filed a legal request to remove Pitt from her name after she turned 18. However, a clerical court error during a background check delayed the hearing on the request, People reported on Monday.\n\nIn November 2023, Zahara shouted out her name as 'Zahara Marley Jolie' at her Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority introduction ceremony at Spelman College, excising 'Pitt' from her last name.\n\nFollowing the latest round of children appearing to remove Pitt's name from their own, it was reported that the oldest boys, Pax and Maddox, had not been using the hyphenated name in years, though it's unknown if they have legally changed their names.brad\n\nAs Pax and his three oldest siblings are all aged over 18, they are not legally required to have regular visitation with dad Pitt, though the pair's younger children, Knox and Vivienne, are.\n\nA source close to the Oscar winner told DailyMail.com that he hopes to 'rekindle' his relationship with his children, claiming that it had been 'broken by the divorce'.\n\nThe source also accused Jolie of ensuring that their children had 'limited involvement' with their father.", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Extra.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Law enforcement sources told the outlet that Pax was \"lucky\" to have survived the accident.\n\nParamedics worried that he may have suffered a brain bleed, but he's reportedly \"stable,\" and he should be good to return home soon. The outlet also noted that Pax has been seen on multiple occasions zooming around Los Angeles on his e-bike, and it's not clear if he's legally required to wear one, due to the style of bike.\n\nPax is the second oldest of six children that Angelina shares with the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actor. Brad and the Girl, Interrupted star also share children: Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16.\n\nSince Brad and Angelina divorced in 2019, they've been involved in a lengthy legal battle about the winery that they co-owned, and some of the children have filed to drop the Fight Club star's last name. Most recently, Angelina has filed to try to end the legal battle with her ex-husband. \"We are not at all surprised Mr. Pitt is afraid to turn over the documents demonstrating these facts. While Angelina again asks Mr. Pitt to end the fighting and finally put their family on a clear path toward healing, unless Mr. Pitt withdraws his lawsuit, Angelina has no choice but to obtain the evidence necessary to prove his allegations wrong,\" Angelina's lawyer said in a statement to People.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_crowley@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "James Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracerebral_hemorrhage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intracerebral hemorrhage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angelina County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Angelina County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Hollywood_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fight Club (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl,_Interrupted", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Girl, Interrupted"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Lowrider", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Lowrider", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Choppers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Choppers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2148346403_0f2cda-e1722359423856.jpg?quality=100&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 135, "textEnd": 142}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Police and paramedics then arrived on the scene, while witnesses said that Pax was experiencing hip pain and he suffered a head injury. He was then rushed to a hospital in Los Angeles to receive treatment.\n\nAccording to the report, the medics feared Pax had suffered a minor brain bleed in the accident. However, it is believed that he's currently stable and was expected to return home the same night of the accident.\n\nPax is the second child of Brad, 60, and Angelina, 49, who were together for one decade before filing for divorce in 2016. He was born in Vietnam in 2003 and adopted by Angelina in 2007. Brad then formally adopted Pax in 2008.\n\nIn addition to Pax, the former couple share kids Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\nTheir kids have remained close with Angelina following the split, while Brad has had strained relationships with all six of their children in recent years.\n\nThe Jolie-Pitt kids have been known to stay out of the spotlight, though Pax reportedly revealed his true feelings about Brad when a social media post seemingly made by Pax from 2020 went viral in 2023.\n\n\"Happy Father's Day to this world class a-hole!\" Pax reportedly wrote in the resurfaced Instagram Story post, which was shared by The Daily Mail.\n\n\"You time and time again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person. You have no consideration or empathy towards your 4 youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence.

So, happy Father's Day, you f-king awful human being!!!\"\n\n\"This is a dark cloud hanging over Brad's head. He can muzzle Angelina with his lawyers, but he can't muzzle his own kids,\" the insider shared. \"They've stayed totally quiet so far, but at some point down the line it's very plausible that they're going to want to tell their side of the story.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's son, Pax Jolie-Pitt, has been hospitalised following a horrific crash. Pax, 20, was believed to be riding his electric bike without a helmet in Los Angeles when the collision occured.\n\nThe bike, as reported by OK! Magazine, collided with the rear of a car, according to law enforcement sources who spoke to TMZ. Pax, who is reportedly estranged from his famous father, was said to be complaining of head pain after the accident.\n\nFollowing the terrifying incident, police and paramedics made the decision to rush him to hospital. The crash occurred around 5pm local time on Los Feliz Boulevard, a notoriously busy street during peak traffic hours. Local police reports suggest that Pax crashed into a stationary car waiting at a red light.\n\nThe driver of the car allegedly exited their vehicle to check on Pax before emergency services arrived. Eyewitnesses at the scene reported that Pax appeared to have sustained a head injury and was heard complaining of hip pain.\n\nOnce considered Hollywood's golden couple, Angelina and Brad's marriage has devolved into a protracted divorce and custody battle, which is rumoured to be nearing its conclusion.\n\nThe tumultuous relationship has been marked by plenty of drama, primarily concerning the custody of their children. Initially, Brad sought a 50/50 split, but as time passed, this seemed increasingly unlikely.\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nTheir three eldest children, Maddox, Pax and Zahara, are now adults and reportedly have a strained relationship with their famous dad. As for their younger children, Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne, Angelina will retain primary custody while Brad will have visitation rights.\n\nPax has previously posted upsetting messages about his dad on social media, and daughter Zahara has ceased using her father's surname.

The car he crashed into was stationary, having been stopped at a red light.\n\nThe driver immediately got out of their car to check on Pax, who sources say clearly needed medial attention.\n\nLaw enforcement sources told TMZ was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash and thus, sustained a head injury following the crash.\n\nPax was quickly transported to a nearby hospital after complaining about pain in his head and hip. Doctors initially feared a minor brain bleed, the outlet said, though the full extent of his injuries are unclear at this time.\n\nThankfully, he is expected to be discharged from the hospital after doctors cleared him.\n\nWhere Are Brad and Angelina?\n\nThere have been no reports on whether Angelina or Brad were at the hospital while Pax was being treated.\n\nWhile Angelina has been in NYC recently , tending to the opening of her new Broadway musical, The Outsiders, it is very possible she is back in the Los Angeles area now to care for her son.\n\nMeanwhile, Brad is in Budapest filming new scenes for his upcoming Formula 1 movie. So, not much chance of a father-son reunion given the distance.\n\nBut even if he is in town, it pretty much sounds like his children are erasing him from their lives. His daughters especially are making sure the world knows they no longer want to be associated with him.\n\nBrad's Bond With His Kids\n\nPax is one of the six children that Brangelina share.\n\nThey are also the parents of Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16.\n\nThe pair are still embroiled in a bitter divorce battle that includes Angelina's claims of Brad being abusive towards her and the children.\n\nSince then, Brad has not been seen with any of his kids in public.

Keep scrolling for more.\n\nFor the unversed, Pax is Jolie and Pitt's middle son, who was adopted by the couple in the early 2000s. He was born in Vietnam, and his brother Maddox is also from Southeast Asia. He grew up with the other five kids of Angelina and Brad, comprising Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne, Maddox, and Knox. Paxton has worked with Jolie in movies like Maleficent and Kung Fu Panda 3, assisted her along with Maddox on First They Killed My Father, and was in the assistant director team on Without Blood, a movie directed by Jolie.\n\nOn Monday, July 29, Pax Jolie-Pitt survived a severe bike accident where his vehicle crashed into a car when he was going for an intersection. It was a dangerous accident, and according to the Hindustan Times report, people present at the spot during the accident initially thought Pax was dead.\n\nPeople immediately rushed over to help Angelina Jolie's son, Pax Jolie-Pitt, after the crash, and they believed he died then there as he was lying completely still on the road after an accident. He regained consciousness after the paramedics at the spot at Los Feliz Boulevard close to Angelina's house.\n\nOn-lookers reported that Pax's bike looked fine when he drove it at the time of the accident, and there were no signs of any visible problem. The report also revealed that he often rides his E-bike on the streets of LA sans a helmet. He survived a severe head injury and was reportedly in the hospital overnight.

As he approached an intersection, he reportedly rammed into a car that stopped at the red light with his electric bike.\n\nThe driver of the car reportedly got down to check on Pax, who was without a helmet at the time of the crash, before the cops and paramedics arrived on the scene.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, witnesses claim he was rushed to an L.A. hospital for treatment after complaining about hip pain and suffering a head injury.\n\nFears about the severity of his health scare heightened as medics feared he suffered a minor brain injury, but the latest reports suggest he's stable now and that there'll be no need for a prolonged hospital stay.\n\nIt comes just weeks after Pax and Jolie were seen grabbing dinner at the high-end Sushi Park in West Hollywood.\n\nThe \"Maleficent\" actress stunned in a figure-hugging black gown with a high slit by the side and completed the flirty look with glasses and high heels.\n\nShe carried a black leather purse and a grey jacket in the crook of her arm as her sleeveless dress allowed her to flash the large tattoo of her six children on her upper left arm.\n\nMeanwhile, Pax wore a blue patterned jacket over a white t-shirt, khaki pants, and white slides.\n\nPitt's son Pax unleashed a scathing Instagram rant against him on Father's Day 2020, labeling his father as a \"world-class a--hole.\"\n\nIn his tirade, Pax expressed how Pitt \"made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell.\" He went on to challenge Pitt's public image, adding: \"You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday.\"\n\nAs reported by The Blast, Pax didn't specify the triggering event for his rant but instead highlighted Pitt's recurring instances of terrible behavior and a lack of empathy toward his four youngest siblings.\n\nHe wrote, \"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person. You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence.\"\n\nThe 19-year-old continued: \"You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you're incapable of doing so.\"\n\nConcluding with a sarcastic tone, Pax wished his father a \"Happy Father's Day,\" punctuated with a blunt reference to the \"Fight Club\" star as an \"f-cking awful human being.\" Pax accompanied the scathing post with a photo of Pitt receiving an Oscar for \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood.\"\n\nPax and some of his other siblings continue to be estranged from their father, Pitt, amid his legal battle with Jolie over the sale of her shares in the French Vineyard, Chateau Miraval.\n\nSeveral of the kids have dropped \"Pitt\" from their names as the actor is said to have a \"non-existent\" relationship with them.\n\nHis biological daughter, Shiloh, took things a step further by taking a legal route to dropping her dad's name the second she turned 18.\n\nAccording to People magazine, Pitt's bond with his older children is so fractured that he has had \"virtually no contact\" with them for a long time.\n\nThe children in question would be Maddox, Pax, Zahara, and Shiloh, as they are all 18 years of age and above, which means they are no longer subject to any custody arrangement.\n\nJolie and Pitt have been embroiled in a custody battle since their 2016 split, and although the \"Once Upon A Time\" actor earlier won a 50-50 custody agreement, that ruling has since been overturned.\n\nIt follows as Jolie is accused of weaponizing the children against Pitt, allegedly telling them to avoid him.\n\n\"It's extremely upsetting,\" a Pitt source shared, per Page Six. \"She has used the kids as a weapon against Brad ... she has separated them from him.\"\n\nThe insider further claimed, \"There is a whole pattern: Any time he has a win in court, she hits back with something to do with the kids.\"\n\nRecently, Jolie requested that her ex-husband drop his lawsuit against her so that their family could \"heal.\" However, Pitt reportedly doesn't intend to back down from their legal dispute.", "source": {"uri":

The former couple also share Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and 15-year-old twins, Vivienne and Knox.\n\nJolie, 48, adopted Pax from a Vietnamese orphanage in 2007, with Pitt formally adopting him a year later. The couple, who were together for 12 years, met on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2005 and separated in 2016.\n\nSince their split, the couple have been involved in several legal disputes. Most recently, they have been in a contentious battle over their Chateau Miraval estate, following Jolie's sale of her share.\n\nIn 2020, their son Pax made headlines when an unearthed social media post surfaced, in which he criticised his father, calling him an \"awful human being.\"\n\nIn the post unearthed by MailOnline, he said: \"You time and time again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person.\"\n\nHe went on: \"You have no consideration or empathy towards your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence.\n\n\"You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you are incapable of doing so.\"\n\nHe added: \"You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want but the truth will come to light someday.\"\n\nIn response to the resurfaced social media, a pal of of Pitt's told The Sun: \"Brad has great respect for all of his children and it's depressing to see this dragged up.\n\n\"It's frustrating to see Brad being painted as some kind of 'bad person' when it's far from the truth.

It was not until paramedics arrived at the scene that the 20-year-old regained consciousness.\n\nThe incident reportedly happened near Angelina's Los Angeles home. Responding police and paramedics rushed Pax to the hospital after he complained of head pain.\n\nThe source also claims that the 'Embtto' artist's bike did not show any obvious signs of damage, despite his serious injuries, reports TMZ.\n\nAngelina, 49, rushed to the hospital to be by her son's bedside, where he is currently in a stable condition. As for Pax's estranged dad, Brad Pitt, a rep for the actor, 60, declined to comment when asked by DailyMail.com if he planned to visit his son in hospital. The Mirror has contacted Brad's reps for comment.\n\nAccording to Page Six, Pax has been in \"multiple\" e-bike accidents before Monday's crash and has \"consistently\" ridden without a helmet. \"His friends are concerned about him.

Witnesses at the scene said he complained of pain in his hip, and they said he appeared to have injured his head in the crash.\n\nFirst responders were reportedly concerned that Pax may have been suffered from bleeding to the brain, so they rushed him to hospital. However, sources later told TMZ that Pax was in stable condition, although the full extent of his injuries isn't yet clear.\n\nPax's accident comes at a time of tension between Brad and Angelina's kids and their Hollywood A-lister dad. A source told People that Brad has \"virtually no contact\" with his adult children. Earlier this month it was reported that Shiloh Jolie-Pitt had petitioned to legally lose the 'Pitt' from her surname. Brad is said to be \"aware and upset\" of her decision.\n\nIn 2020, Pax branded the actor a \"world class a** hole\" on Father's Day. A source within Pitt's inner circle has since responded, saying: \"It's frustrating to see Brad being painted as some kind of 'bad person' when it's far from the truth.\"\n\nThe Sun went on to quote them adding that Pitt has \"great respect\" for his children, arguing it \"speaks volumes he chooses to keep a dignified silence\" about the situation.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_johns@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Victoria Johns", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphanage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orphanage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33354334.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-EXCLUSIVE-Pax-Jolie-Pitt-enjoys-a-ride-on-his-electric-bike.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He is expected to be discharged from the hospital on Tuesday.\n\nPax is one of the six children shared by exes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The Eternals fame filed for divorce in 2016 with the central issue appearing to be a private jet encounter. Jolie claimed Pitt choked one of their children and struck another in the face. Additionally, she alleged the Hollywood star also grabbed her by the hand and shook her violently.\n\nPitt denied the claims and the FBI refused to lament charges against him. The exes have been since embroiled in a nasty lawsuit over assets and the custody of their kids. Pitt and Jolie were legally declared single in 2019.

However, recent events may have pushed all of those feelings aside. It has been reported that Pitt and Jolie's son Pax smashed his electric bicycle into a car on a busy L.A. street. The 20-year-old was riding his bike during rush hour traffic on Los Feliz Blvd. As the young man approached a red light, he slammed into the back of a stationary car.\n\nTMZ reports that the driver of the car got out to check on Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's son, who was not wearing a helmet while riding. After police and paramedics arrived on the scene, it was said that Pax was \"experiencing hip pain\" as well as suffering from a head injury.\n\nPax is the fourth of Pitt and Jolie's children and is seen around Los Angeles almost exclusively riding his e-bike. For the most part he is said to never be wearing a helmet. Paramedics feared the young man may have suffered a minor brain bleed in the accident. However, it is rumored that Pax is now stable.\n\nBrad Pitt's relationship with Pax is likely very bad. Pitt is said to have little to no contact with his older children, while he still has visitation with the younger ones. Although Pitt has not made a comment on his son's accident as of right now, he is most likely worried.\n\nAngelina Jolie is the primary caregiver for her and Pitt's children as she won custody after their messy divorce. The former couple battled in court for some time over custody as well as assets.\n\nWhile Brad Pitt has shown regret for how things went down, he and Angelina Jolie are still on very bad terms. However, maybe they can put those feelings aside and be there for their son as he recovers from his accident.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trevor_swerlein@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Trevor Swerlein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracerebral_hemorrhage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intracerebral hemorrhage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Brad-Pitt-Varitey-Angelina-Jolie-WSJ-Style.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The incident took place as he neared a traffic light and collided with the back of a stationary car at the junction, as per information from a law enforcement insider disclosed to TMZ.\n\nTMZ stated that the driver of the car stopped to inspect Pax's condition, noting that he wasn't wearing a helmet when the crash happened. Emergency services and law enforcement quickly reached the location, and witnesses mentioned that Pax was complaining of hip discomfort and had sustained a head injury. Subsequently, he was promptly transported to a hospital in Los Angeles for medical attention.\n\nIt was reported that medical personnel were concerned that Pax might have incurred a minor brain hemorrhage due to the accident. Nevertheless, reports suggest that he is currently in a stable condition and was anticipated to be discharged on the same evening of the mishap.\n\nPax is the second child of Brad, 60, and Angelina, 49, who were together for one decade before filing for divorce in 2016. He was born in Vietnam in 2003 and adopted by Angelina in 2007. Brad then formally adopted Pax in 2008.\n\nIn addition to Pax, the former couple share kids Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\nTheir kids have remained close with Angelina following the split, while Brad has had strained relationships with all six of their children in recent years.\n\nThe Jolie-Pitt kids have been known to stay out of the spotlight, though Pax reportedly revealed his true feelings about Brad when a social media post seemingly made by Pax from 2020 went viral in 2023.\n\n\"Happy Father's Day to this world class a-hole!\" Pax reportedly wrote in the resurfaced Instagram Story post, which was shared by The Daily Mail.\n\n\"You time and time again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person. You have no consideration or empathy towards your 4 youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence. You will never understand the damage you've done to my family because you are incapable of doing so,\" he continued. \"You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday. So, happy Father's Day, you f-king awful human being!!!\"\n\nMore recently, a source exclusively told In Touch that Brad worried about his kids discussing their drama in a tell-all interview.\n\n\"This is a dark cloud hanging over Brad's head. He can muzzle Angelina with his lawyers, but he can't muzzle his own kids,\" the insider shared. \"They've stayed totally quiet so far, but at some point down the line it's very plausible that they're going to want to tell their side of the story. There's nothing to stop them from doing it.\"\n\nThe source added, \"And when they decide to go ahead and talk, Brad will just have to sit back and take it.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traffic light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracerebral_hemorrhage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intracerebral hemorrhage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Childfree", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Childfree", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pax-jolie-pitt-bike-accident.jpg?fit=400%2C537&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 238, "textEnd": 245}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

TMZ reports he remained there over night.\n\nThe incident comes amid Pitt and Jolie's legal battle to divorce, the pair having been declared legally single in 2019 but still in dispute over financial, custodial agreements - and their winery.\n\nPitt sued Jolie in 2022 for selling off her stake in the former couple's winery in France - Ch\u00e2teau Miraval - to a Russian oligarch's company named Stoli.\n\nPitt accused Jolie of having sold her shares without his consent, alleging they'd previously agreed to pass down the winery to their children. Jolie denied any wrongdoing and said she was allowed to sell her shares without the Babylon actor's consent, and Solti filed a $350 million countersuit against Pitt accusing him of misusing company assets.\n\nPitt denied the claims, and in a more recent motion in the legal battle, his lawyer accused Jolie of turning the 'business dispute into a re-litigation of the former couple's divorce case' by allegedly requesting Pitt turn over all private communication he had with friends and business partners relating to an incident on a plane in 2016.\n\nUNILAD previously reached out to representatives for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for comment.

The accident took place during rush hour at Hobart and Los Feliz Boulevard around 5pm, per the LAPD.\n\nPax was not wearing a helmet at the time, and was taken to the hospital to treat a head injury as well as hip pain. It was feared Pax had suffered a minor brain bleed because of the crash, but TMZ later reported that he was in stable condition and expected to return home imminently.\n\nET reported that there is no criminal element -- like DUI or hit and run -- to the accident, and that the Eternals star is with her son.\n\nBrad and Angelina -- who fell in love on the set of 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith, married in 2014, and divorced in 2016 -- share biological children Shiloh, 18, Vivienne and Knox, 15, and adopted children Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, and Zahara, 19.\n\nThe news comes amid Shiloh requesting to legally change her last name to just Jolie, rather than Jolie-Pitt. As far as why, Us Weekly reported it has to do with loyalty to her mother during her parents' contentious divorce.\n\n\"They've struggled to forgive and connect with Brad since the divorce. Their mom is the head of the household, and she's raised them with love and selflessness their whole lives. Once Brad left, it was very hard for them to see him go to war with her,\" a source told the publication.\n\nShiloh filed the paperwork in California on May 27, 2024, and the request is expected to be granted in the near future. According to a source for People, the Wolfs actor is \"aware and upset\" about Shiloh dropping his last name.\n\n\"He's never felt more joy than when she was born. He always wanted a daughter,\" the source told the publication, adding, \"The reminders that he's lost his children, is of course not easy for Brad. He loves his children and misses them.

The accident was so intense that those who witnessed it initially feared the worst, believing Pax might have died due to the crash's severity. Pax was quickly transported to a nearby hospital in Los Angeles for emergency medical care.\n\nEyewitnesses on the scene described the accident as brutal. Pax crashed his bike into a car while approaching an intersection on Los Feliz Boulevard, near Angelina Jolie's residence. The force of the collision left Pax lying motionless on the ground, leading bystanders to assume he had died on the spot. When paramedics arrived, Pax regained consciousness, much to the relief of those present. The first responders were particularly concerned about the possibility of a brain bleed due to the head injury he sustained, though specific details about his injuries remain undisclosed. Pax also complained of hip pain following the accident.\n\nDespite the crash, there were no apparent issues with Pax's BMX-style bike. Witnesses reported that the bike appeared to be in good condition both before and after the accident. Pax is known for frequently riding his bike around Los Angeles without wearing a helmet, which likely contributed to the severity of his head injury.\n\nAfter the accident, Pax was kept overnight in the hospital, where his condition was stabilized. Angelina Jolie stayed by his side throughout his recovery. Information about Brad Pitt's reaction to the incident has not been made available.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Doctors had reportedly initially feared a minor brain bleed.\n\nThe accident occurred on Monday (29 July) on Los Feliz Boulevard in LA during rush hour at around 5pm in the evening.\n\nSpeaking to TMZ, law enforcement sources said Pax's electric bike had crashed into the back of a car at an intersection.\n\nSources said that after the crash, the driver got out of his car to check on Pax before the paramedics arrived at the scene. The Independent has contacted a representative of Pax for comment.\n\nPax is one of six children Jolie shares with her former husband Pitt. They also share Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 15.\n\nPax made headlines in December last year, when a Father's Day post from 2020 was unearthed by the MailOnline, in which he called his father a \"world class a**hole\" and \"f***ing awful human being\".\n\n\"Happy Father's Day to this world class a***hole,\" Pax reportedly addressed a message to his adoptive dad. \"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person.\n\n\"You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence.\"\n\nJolie and Pitt announced their split in 2016, and the break-up has been acrimonious. Jolie is thought to have filed for divorce after an incident on a September 2016 private flight from France to Los Angeles.\n\nCourt filings obtained by The New York Times claimed that Pitt \"choked one of the children and struck another in the face\" and \"grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her\". It also claimed that \"he poured beer on Jolie\" and \"poured beer and red wine on the children\".\n\nPitt vehemently denied the claims at the time, and was never charged following an investigation into the allegations. However, a detailed account of what transpired on the private plane was made public last year, after FBI records were leaked to the press.\n\nEarlier this month, their daughter Shiloh confirmed she had dropped her father's surname. The 18-year-old filed for her legal name to be changed from Shiloh Jolie-Pitt to Shiloh Jolie.\n\nAlthough Shiloh is thought to be the first of their children to embark on the legal process required to officially change names, both Vivienne and Zahara have unofficially dropped their father's surname.\n\nIn May, Shiloh's younger sister Vivienne dropped Pitt from her surname, according to the programme for Broadway play The Outsiders, which she worked on alongside her mother.\n\nIn 2023, Zahara, 19, also appeared to have decided to no longer use her father's surname, as she was introduced to her university's sorority as Zahara Marley Jolie.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One law enforcement insider revealed to TMZ that the incident took place on Los Feliz Boulevard at approximately 5pm during peak traffic hours.\n\nIt is understood the driver got out of the vehicle to check on the star before police and paramedics were called to the scene. Pax was allegedly not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, reports the Mirror.\n\nREAD MORE:Rege-Jean Page's new movie gets major release date as he teams up with huge names\n\nREAD MORE: Click for more brilliant Daily Star showbiz stories\n\nOnlookers claimed that Pax was struggling with hip pain and also suffered a head injury before he was taken to a hospital nearby. It has been reported that medical staff were worried he could have a minor bleed on the brain, but is said to be stable now and may be going home this evening (July 30).\n\nIt comes after Pax decided to follow in his parent's footsteps by pursuing a career in acting.. He recently had a voiceover role in Kung Fu Panda 3 as well as a stint in the Disney film Maleficent.\n\nBack in 2023, it was revealed that Pax allegedly wrote a blistering Father's Day message to the One Upon... In Hollywood star in 2020. On his Instagram Story at the time, it is understood the star shared a picture of Brad receiving an Oscar for his role in the Quentin Tarantino hit film.\n\nAround the photo he is said to have wroth a lengthy rant aimed at the Fight Club star. The post apparently read: \"Happy Father's Day to this world class a*****e!! You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person.\n\n\"You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence. You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you are incapable of doing so. \"\n\nThe furious rant continued: \"You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday. So, Happy Father's Day, you f*****g awful human being!!!\".\n\nAngelina adopted Pax back in 2007 from Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam when he was just three-years-old. One year later, Brad Pitt officially adopted Pax.\n\nHowever, the pair have reportedly had a difficult relationship for several years now.

Responding police and paramedics rushed Pax to the hospital after he complained of head pain.\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift tickets: 'I risked it all to find out if buying resale from Viagogo was legit'\n\nREAD MORE: BBC called out over reaction to Daniel Wiffen winning Olympic gold medal for Ireland\n\nThe source also claims that the 'Embtto' artist's bike did not show any obvious signs of damage, despite his serious injuries, reports TMZ.\n\nAngelina, 49, rushed to the hospital to be by her son's bedside, where he is currently in a stable condition. As for Pax's estranged dad, Brad Pitt, a rep for the actor, 60, declined to comment when asked by DailyMail.com if he planned to visit his son in hospital. The Mirror has contacted Brad's reps for comment.\n\nPax, who was adopted by Angelina from a Vietnamese orphanage near Ho Chi Minh City in 2012, had reportedly been driving down Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m.\n\nAccording to law enforcement sources, he was approaching an intersection when he crashed his bike into the back of the car, which had already stopped for the red light. Witnesses at the scene said he complained of pain in his hip, and they said he appeared to have injured his head in the crash.\n\nFirst responders were reportedly concerned that Pax may have been suffered from bleeding to the brain, so they rushed him to hospital. However, sources later told TMZ that Pax was in stable condition, although the full extent of his injuries isn't yet clear.\n\nPax's collision comes at a time of tension between Brad and Angelina's kids and their Hollywood A-lister dad. A source told People that Brad has \"virtually no contact\" with his adult children. Earlier this month it was reported that Shiloh Jolie-Pitt had petitioned to legally lose the 'Pitt' from her surname. Brad is said to be \"aware and upset\" of her decision.\n\nIn 2020, Pax branded the actor a \" world class a** hole\" on Father's Day. A source within Pitt's inner circle has since responded, saying: \"It's frustrating to see Brad being painted as some kind of 'bad person' when it's far from the truth.\"\n\nThe Sun went on to quote them adding that Pitt has \"great respect\" for his children, arguing it \"speaks volumes he chooses to keep a dignified silence\" about the situation.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

stars Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt from Vietnam in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is said to be in a stable condition but the full extent of injuries has not been revealed yet.\n\nHe was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash.\n\nPax was seen riding a Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike around Los Angeles just days before the collision.\n\nHowever, it's not been made clear if it is the same bike that was involved in the accident.\n\nHere's everything we know about Pax's life, career and family relations.\n\nPax Thien Jolie-Pitt, 20, was born on November 29, 2003 in Pham Quang Sang, Vietnam.\n\nHis biological mother - who was battling addiction - abandoned him when he was only two days old after discovering he had liver problems.\n\nHe was later placed at the Tam Binh Orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nPax was adopted by Angelina Jolie from the Vietnamese orphanage in 2007.\n\nPax has a number of siblings, although not biologically related.\n\nThis includes Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and 16-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.\n\nHe also has a 22-year-old older brother, Maddox.\n\nJolie took middle son Pax as her guest to the Golden Globes in 2018 as a way to spend quality time with him.\n\nShe told Vogue in 2021 that she had left Pitt, 59, \"for the wellbeing\" of her family.\n\nJolie initially took full custody of their six children, but a new arrangement in 2021 allowed them to spend 50 per cent of their time with Pitt.\n\nHowever the decision was revoked after it turned out that the judge on the case had close business relations with Pitt.\n\nSince then, the pair have gone back and forth over custody and visitation rights.\n\nSince their divorce, the two have also become embroiled in a bitter legal court battle for their $350 million France vineyard.\n\nJolie had filed for divorce in 2016, two years after they wed and just days after reports of a clash between Pitt and Pax's older brother Maddox on a private jet.\n\nAllegations Pitt had been drinking and Maddox stood up for his mum during a row sparked a probe by the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services.\n\nAlthough Brad is apparently on good terms with his twins, the insider claimed Maddox, Pax, and Zahara have not \"repaired their relationship\" with the patriarch.\n\nPax branded his estranged father \"a world-class a**hole\" in a scathing post on Father's day in 2020.\n\n\"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person.\"\n\nPax has made his own mark in the world into the movie world, voicing the character of Yoo on Kung Fu Panda 3.\n\nHe was also a set photographer on Jolie's film - First They Killed My Father in August 2022.\n\nDetailing working with Pax and Maddox on various film sets, Jolie told People: \"We work well together.\n\n\"When a film crew is at its best, it feels like a big family, so it felt natural.\"\n\nPax graduated from a prestigious LA private school in 2021, but opted not to go as he did not want to make a \"circus\" of the event.\n\nEarlier this year, Pax reportedly become an artist - creating work under the pseudonym \"Embtto\" - but the story turned out to be a hoax.\n\nPax seemingly keeps a great deal of his personal life out of the public eye.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_singh@thesun.co.uk", "name":

The young Jolie-Pitt was riding his electric bike around 5 p.m. when he collided with the rear of a stationary car at a red light, law enforcement sources revealed to TMZ.\n\nEyewitnesses reported that Pax was not wearing a helmet during the accident. Following the impact, he complained of head injury and hip pain. Emergency services arrived promptly, and Pax was transported to a nearby hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nInitially, there were fears of a minor brain bleed, according to medical personnel at the scene. However, further assessments indicated that Pax's condition was stable, and he is expected to be discharged from the hospital. The full extent of his injuries remains unclear, but he is under careful observation to rule out any severe complications.\n\nSeveral publications reported that eyewitnesses said the car's driver in the incident immediately exited the vehicle to check on Pax's condition before emergency services arrived. The exact location of the impact on Pax's head was not specified, but bystanders confirmed that his head sustained injuries in the crash.\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, who share six children, including Pax, Maddox (22), Zahara (19), Shiloh (18), and twins Knox and Vivienne (16), have yet to comment publicly on the incident.\n\nIt's been no secret that there is a drift between Jolie and Pitt. While the former couple has not personally addressed any reports about a father-children strain, Shiloh Jolie's legal name change, dropping Pitt, has been one of many clues. Following the news in March that the \"Fight Club\" star was no longer seeking shared custody of the children they share, people have been curious about what, if any, relationship he has with them. Previously, People reported that the actor had \"virtually no contact\" with the adult kids.\n\nThe only two that are still minors are twins Knox and Vivienne, 15. The source said Jolie has the kids \"most of the time,\" but the couple's custody agreement allows him visitation rights. They noted it's been \"more limited\" in recent months because he is currently on location in Europe filming the upcoming racing movie, \"F1.\"\n\nWhile it's unclear when Brad saw his youngest children the last time, there have been clues that Vivienne is also distancing herself from her father.

The accident took place during rush hour at Hobart and Los Feliz Boulevard around 5pm, per the LAPD.\n\nPax was not wearing a helmet at the time, and was taken to the hospital to treat a head injury as well as hip pain. It was feared Pax had suffered a minor brain bleed because of the crash, but TMZ later reported that he was in stable condition and expected to return home imminently.\n\nET reported that there is no criminal element -- like DUI or hit and run -- to the accident, and that the Eternals star is with her son.\n\nBrad and Angelina -- who fell in love on the set of 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith, married in 2014, and divorced in 2016 -- share biological children Shiloh, 18, Vivienne and Knox, 15, and adopted children Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, and Zahara, 19.\n\nThe news comes amid Shiloh requesting to legally change her last name to just Jolie, rather than Jolie-Pitt. As far as why, Us Weekly reported it has to do with loyalty to her mother during her parents' contentious divorce.\n\n\"They've struggled to forgive and connect with Brad since the divorce. Their mom is the head of the household, and she's raised them with love and selflessness their whole lives. Once Brad left, it was very hard for them to see him go to war with her,\" a source told the publication.\n\nShiloh filed the paperwork in California on May 27, 2024, and the request is expected to be granted in the near future. According to a source for People, the Wolfs actor is \"aware and upset\" about Shiloh dropping his last name.\n\n\"He's never felt more joy than when she was born. He always wanted a daughter,\" the source told the publication, adding, \"The reminders that he's lost his children, is of course not easy for Brad. He loves his children and misses them.

Yikes!\n\nRelated: Shiloh's Decision To Drop Brad's Last Name Stems From 'Painful Events'\n\nPax, who is currently estranged from his famous father alongside many of his siblings, was not wearing a helmet at the time. The driver of the car reportedly got out to check on the young man before emergency services arrived. Pax was complaining about a head injury and hip pain, so they got him to a nearby hospital ASAP.\n\nWhile the extent of his injuries is unclear, doctors reportedly feared he might have had a minor brain bleed. Scary! The good news is that sources told the outlet that he was in stable condition, and they thought he might even be released from the hospital sometime on Monday night. As of Tuesday morning, though, it's not known if he has been discharged yet.\n\nEither way, phew! We're glad he has the best medical attention on hand because this is so, so scary! We are sending our thoughts and healing vibes to Pax!\n\n[Image via MEGA/WENN]", "source": {"uri": "perezhilton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perez Hilton"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crash (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yikes_(Kanye_West_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yikes (Kanye West song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracerebral_hemorrhage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intracerebral hemorrhage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Entertainment_News_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Entertainment News Network"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Mountain_Biking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Mountain Biking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Lowrider", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Lowrider", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Choppers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Choppers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pax-jolie-pitt-injured-bike-accident.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

As Jolie-Pitt approached a red light, he slammed into the back of a car stopped at an intersection, police sources told TMZ.\n\nThe driver of the car got out to check on the celebrity offspring -- who was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, TMZ reported. Witnesses told TMZ that Jolie-Pitt complained of hip pain and appeared to have suffered a head injury, so he was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.\n\nAngelina reportedly rushed to the hospital to be by her son's side, Page Six reported Tuesday. He also was reported to be in stable condition.\n\nNow, it remains to be seen whether Jolie-Pitt will start wearing a helmet when he rides his e-bike, especially around busy Los Angeles. TMZ reported that Jolie-Pitt has recently been seen cruising around the city on his bike, and almost always without a helmet.\n\nPage Six quoted a source who said that the 20-year-old been involved in \"multiple\" accidents on his bicycle prior to Monday's crash. The source also said that he almost never wears a helmet.\n\n\"His friends are concerned about him,\" an insider shares. \"He's being reckless. They're worried.\"\n\nTMZ said that California helmet laws differs on whether helmets are required, depending on the class of bicycle, so it's unclear whether Jolie-Pax needed a helmet for this particular bicycle. However, it seems apparent that a helmet would have been useful for Jolie-Pitt on Monday night, TMZ added.\n\nPerhaps his famous mother will give him a stern warning or nag him about wearing a helmet. He and his mother appear to be close and were spotted having a mother-son dinner date on July 12, photographed heading into celebrity hotspot Sushi Park in West Hollywood, People reported.\n\nIt's not likely, though, that Jolie-Pitt can expect any reprimand or advice from Pitt, given that he and his Oscar-winning father are reportedly estranged.\n\nOf Jolie and Pitt's six children, the \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" star has \"virtually no contact\" with his three older children, Pax, Maddox, 22, and Zahara, 19. Jolie and Pitt also share 18-year-old daughter Shiloh and 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\nShiloh has been in the news recently because of her legal petition to formally drop Pitt's last name from her own so that she would henceforth be known as Shiloh Jolie, instead of Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. It's not clear if she, too, is estranged from the actor, but her decision to drop his last name has left him \"upset\" because he \"never felt more joy than when she was born,\" a source told People magazine last month. Another source told In Touch Weekly that Pitt, who once had a close relationship with Shiloh, was \"blindsided\" and \"heartbroken\" by her decision to drop his last name.\n\nPitt's estrangement from his children, including Pax, reportedly developed in the wake of Jolie filing for divorce in September 2016. The ex-Hollywood super couple quickly became locked in a bitter, years-long legal battle over custody and their winery and chateau in the South of France. With four of the children reaching adulthood, the custody battle has become moot, but the court fight over the winery continues.\n\nA lot of the bitterness stems from Jolie's allegations that Pitt was intoxicated and verbally and physically abusive to Jolie and several of their children during a September 2016 private plane ride from Europe to Los Angeles. Pitt has long denied the allegations. Pitt's reported behavior on the plane ride prompted Jolie to file for divorce.", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@eastbaytimes.com", "name": "Martha Ross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Hollywood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Hollywood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Hollywood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Hollywood_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Touch_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "In Touch Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercouple", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supercouple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PaxAngelina.jpeg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 2066, "textEnd": 2073}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-09-", "textStart": 3288, "textEnd": 3302, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The incident occurred at 5 p.m. EST when. Pax reportedly sustained a head injury and is dealing with hip pain. A severe traffic collision report was completed at the scene.\n\nPax is one of Jolie and Brad Pitt's six children. They also share Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, 16. Since Jolie and Pitt's split, Pitt has reportedly been estranged from his children. This summer, a source told PEOPLE that Jolie \"seems very happy and content with her life\" now, and that she stays \"focused on her kids and work.\" Pitt reportedly believes Jolie has been brainwashing the children with negative views about him.\n\nShiloh recently sought a court hearing to drop Pitt from her name altogether, but the hearing was postponed to August. \"Unfortunately, the court was unable to complete the background check ahead of today's hearing, so the hearing was rescheduled for August 19. This is normal,\" Shiloh's attorney, Peter Levine, told Us Weekly. \"Everyone undergoing a name-change request needs to have a background check conducted by the court clerk, and because of clerical error, Shiloh's hearing has been continued to a new date.\"\n\nA reported fight in an airplane in 2016 that is said to have involved one of Jolie and Pitts' children led to the famous pair's divorce. But in recent court documents, Jolie says the abuse began long before then.", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Battle of Shiloh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Knox County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwashing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brainwashing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_clerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Court clerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2022/09/07/645dec3d-8f2b-4076-962b-e409b4107985/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 214, "textEnd": 221}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 1300, "textEnd": 1309}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Apparently, he's been in \"multiple\" bike accidents and he has been \"consistent\" about never wearing a helmet. An insider explained:\n\n\"His friends are concerned about him. He's being reckless. They're worried.\"\n\nOh, no...\n\nRelated: This Aussie Athlete CUT OFF HIS FINGER To Compete In Paris Olympics!\n\nIt's unclear how many accidents he's been in or how serious they've been, but this is obviously a scary pattern! Thankfully, he seems to be doing okay now, though he remains in the hospital. A source told People that the Maleficent star is \"with him and reported that he's stable.\" Such a relief!\n\nAs we covered, at around 5 p.m. on Monday, the 20-year-old crashed into the back of a car that was stopped at a red light at an intersection on Los Feliz Boulevard. Per TMZ, he complained of a head injury and hip pain after the incident and was rushed to a nearby hospital. It is unclear when he will be discharged or the full extent of his injuries. At least he's in stable condition!\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department confirmed the accident in a statement to People, saying that a man in his early 20s was riding a scooter when an accident occurred. A severe traffic collision report was completed. Few other details are known about the incident at this time.\n\nAs Perezcious readers know, Pax is one of six kids the actress shares with Brad, who has had \"virtually no contact\" with his adult children these days . Pax has been very outspoken against his father, so it's unlikely he'll be headed to the hospital. But you never know.\n\nWe're glad to hear Pax is doing well, and we hope for more safety in his future! Helmets, at the very least, are so important!\n\nThoughts?

There is no evidence of a crime and we ended up taking a severe traffic report,\" he said.\n\nPax is one of Pitt and Jolie's six children.\n\nThis news comes amid the famous couple's ongoing divorce battle. The couple split in 2016 after Jolie accused Pitt of choking one of their children during a volatile trans-Atlantic flight in 2016. Jolie filed for divorce following the alleged incident. NBC News obtained the FBI report of the incident in 2022, following a Freedom of Information/Privacy Act lawsuit brought by \"Jane Doe.\"\n\nFollowing the alleged incident, Pitt was investigated by the Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family Services. NBC News has previously reported that Pitt was cleared of any wrongdoing, and criminal charges were never brought against the actor.\n\nSince 2016, the exes have been in a legal battle over their winery, Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, located in the south of France. Pitt sued Jolie, accusing her of having improperly sold her half of the winery to Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler. Miraval was the site of their wedding in 2014.\n\nAlthough the couple's divorce is still ongoing, in 2019 they were granted a \"bifurcated judgment,\" meaning they are legally single.\n\nThis story

He's not a celebrity except for his association with his parents, but he can still grab headlines. He's doing it now, though not for a joyous reason. 20-year-old Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt was hospitalized earlier this week after ramming his dirt bike into the back of a car stopped at the lights. He was injured in the fall, most likely because he wasn't wearing a helmet, and is still in hospital under observation as of this writing.\n\nThe good news is that it seems that his injuries are not serious, and he will be sent home soon.\n\nAccording to one celebrity publication, the crash occurred on Monday, July 29, on Los Feliz Blvd. in Los Angeles, during rush hour. Pax was on his bike, without a helmet, as he approached a red light, failing to brake in time to a full stop and ramming into the back of a car that had stopped at the light.\n\nPhoto: SURRON EUROPE The report cites law enforcement sources, so there's little reason to doubt its accuracy. On that same note, this is the same celebrity publication that broke some of the biggest showbiz stories of recent years, before they were even confirmed by reps or law enforcement.\n\nUntil paramedics arrived on the scene, the driver of the car stayed with Pax. The 20-year-old was complaining of pain in his hip and head, and eyewitnesses claimed that he'd suffered some kind of head injury when he was thrown off the bike.\n\nAs you probably anticipated, news of the accident has reignited the age-old debate of whether you should wear a helmet even in territories where one isn't mandated by law. Pax's choice of a bike makes the issue a moot one, because his e-bike is a lightweight electric motorcycle that doesn't fall in the three-class categorization system.\n\nPhoto: SURRON EUROPE Photos of Pax riding around town in the weeks leading up to the crash show him on what looks like a modified Surron. Surron bikes are dirt bikes that Surron themselves describe as \"not an e-bike\" but an \"e-dirt bike\" that would fall in the non-existent \"class 4 category.\" With the single exception of the street-legal Surron Light Bee LBX (L1e), Surron bikes are not legal except for use on private property.\n\nThey pack powerful motors that start at 3,000W, peak at 6,000W, and develop 250Nm (184 ft-lb) of torque, lack pedals, and can easily hit 75 kph (46.6 mph) without modifications. With modifications - which Surron doesn't condone, by the way - one such bike can go as fast as 80-85 kph (50-53 mph).\n\nHelmet legislation depends from state to state and country to country, and according to what class of bike you're riding. Since the Surron is so powerful and fast as to defy classification, it's always best to ride one with the proper safety gear.", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elena_gorgan@autoevolution.com", "name": "Elena Gorgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_motorcycles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Types of motorcycles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street-legal_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Street-legal vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motorcycles_and_scooters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric motorcycles and scooters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_pedal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle pedal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Bikers", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Bikers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/angelina-jolie-s-son-pax-hospitalized-after-crashing-his-e-bike-into-a-car-237754_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774635", "eventUri": "eng-9774635", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 823, "textEnd": 830}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

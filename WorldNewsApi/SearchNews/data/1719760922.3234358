Munition debris filmed at the strike location the next day was remnants from a GBU-39, a bomb designed and manufactured in the United States, The Times found. U.S. officials have been pushing Israel to use more of this type of bomb, which they say can reduce civilian casualties. The key detail in the weapon debris was the tail actuation system, which controls the fins that guide the GBU-39 to a target, according to Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, who earlier identified the weapon on X. The weapon\u2019s unique bolt pattern and slot where the folding fins are stowed were clearly visible in the debris, Mr. Ball said.", "summary": "A Times visual analysis found that munition debris filmed at the scene were remnants of a GBU-39, a bomb designed and manufactured in the United States.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/middleeast/israel-us-rafah-bombs.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/28/world/middleeast/28vi_rafah_weapon_01_still_sppatch/28vi_rafah_weapon_01_still_sppatch--facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:25:08", "author": "Christiaan Triebert,Haley Willis", "authors": ["Christiaan Triebert", "Haley Willis"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.188}

While Liverpool are looking to finish with a flourish after a shocking April of two defeats and two draws saw their title bid crumble.\n\nLiverpool captain Van Dijk added: \"Nothing has been announced but there's rumours, things out there that he [Slot] could be his successor. So let's see, we have two more games in this season.\n\n\"And when it is over and there is news, we will focus on what is coming next but it is a fact that there will be a lot of changes happening and it will be interesting.\n\n\"I am here to be a part of that and looking forward to it.

We are winners and we were close and that is how it is, we weren't good enough in the decisive moments but that is life. We have to stick together and we will.\n\n\"It's on us and a few of us have been in title races and on the losing sides at times and it hurts. But yeah, like I said we have to take this experience with us and you only improve if you learn and that is the aim and we can take that into next season. We want to give the manager a good farewell and do it for ourselves as well.\n\n\"[The lack of clean sheets] is not great but we are in the last part of the season and fatigue kicks in. We got three points, that is what matters but of course we want clean sheets. It didn't happen today and it is something we definitely have to improve and I feel responsible because I am one of the leaders at the back.

No doubt there will be tears in the stands as Klopp says goodbye after nine-and-a-half hugely successful, and transformative, years on Merseyside, with his exit inevitably leading to speculation about the future of his players, too.\n\nCome the end of next month, Van Dijk will have 12 months remaining on his current deal and, having been at Liverpool since January 2018, he could be forgiven for feeling the time would be right for him to also depart. But the club captain, who has well and truly returned to top form this season, insists he wants to remain in situ and work under Klopp's successor, who is highly likely to be Dutch compatriot, Arne Slot.\n\n\"The focus is now on the last two games and then the club will focus on who the new manager is and there will be a big transition and I am part of that,\" said Van Dijk. \"There is nothing for me to discuss [regarding his future] because there is no news.

Little wonder, then, that the 32-year-old is full of praise for the man who put his trust in him and oversaw that glory. \"He is a fantastic manager, a great human being and we have a great relationship,\" said Van Dijk of Klopp. \"I am really proud I played for him, fought for the badge and him and count the success we had over the years as well.\n\n\"It will be emotional on the last day but it is a part of life sometimes.

Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has hinted that he will be remaining at Anfield this summer to help oversee the club's transition in the post-Jurgen Klopp era.\n\nThe Reds have just two more Premier League games left under the tutelage of Klopp, whose distinguished nine-year reign will come to an end later this month.\n\nThe German announced in January that he was losing the energy to continue in the hotseat and would be stepping down at the end of the season, when Feyenoord boss Arne Slot is expected to take over.\n\nKlopp's departure raised concerns that some of the 56-year-old's Liverpool stalwarts could follow him out of the exit door, namely Van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, two players whose contracts expire next summer.\n\nReports have claimed that Salah is expected to stay put, but Bayern Munich and teams in Saudi Arabia are supposedly keeping a close eye on Van Dijk ahead of the possibility of a free transfer in 2025.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nVan Dijk \"part\" of \"big transition\" under Slot\n\nHowever, speaking to reporters after Sunday's 4-2 Premier League triumph over Tottenham Hotspur, Van Dijk erased any doubt over his immediate Liverpool future, claiming that he will be \"part\" of the Reds' new era.\n\n\"There will be a big transition and I am part of that,\" the Dutchman said. \"I think the club is very much busy with who is going to be the new manager and that is the main focus.\n\n\"Like I said I am very happy here, I love the club and you can see that as well.

It's a big part of my life already.\n\n'The focus is now on the last two games and then the club will focus on who the new manager is and there will be a big transition and I am part of that.'\n\nVan Dijk is 'looking forward' to his next chapter at Liverpool, whether or not Slot is the man to replace Klopp this summer.\n\n'Is he the new manager? Nothing has been announced but there's rumours,' he added.\n\n'When the season is over and there is news, we will focus on what is coming next, but it is a fact that there will be a lot of changes happening and it will be interesting. I am here to be a part of that and looking forward to it.\n\n'I am at the captain so I want to help, I will help and I should help. If he is the one who comes then let's see.\n\n'We know other things are decided and Michael Edwards is coming back, Richard Hughes will be the sporting director, they are the only decisions that have been made. I have got full trust in the club to make the right decisions.\n\n'There will be a lot of changes happening. I wouldn't say scary is the right word but it is quite interesting and exciting what will happen now.'\n\nAfter questioning the squad's hunger in the wake of Liverpool's defeat to Everton, the centre-half has had time to reflect and believes there are positives to take from the campaign.\n\n'Listen, if you said at the start of the season that this is how it would have gone then I think we would have taken that,' he continued.\n\n'We are winners and we were close. We weren't good enough in the decisive moments but that is life. We have to stick together and we will.\n\n'A few of us have been in title races and on the losing sides at times and it hurts.\n\n'But we have to take this experience with us and you only improve if you learn and that is the aim and we can take that into next season.\n\n'We want to give the manager a good farewell and do it for ourselves as well.'\n\nMORE : 'That's my fear' -

time.\n\nNegotiations are set to commence within a week of the season finale at home to Wolves, with a 'well-placed' source at LFC indicating that tying down the captain's future is the 'A1 priority' for Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes.\n\nThe centre-back is deemed an 'irreplaceable' player at Liverpool, and his existing deal now has little more than a year to run.\n\nREAD MORE: (Video) Virgil

these reports prove accurate, then Edwards and Hughes clearly aren't messing around when it comes to boxing off Van Dijk's future quite early in what'll be a summer of significant transition at Liverpool with Jurgen Klopp leaving.\n\nThe player himself has said that he intends to be 'part of' the immediate future at Anfield, which serves as an open invitation for club chiefs to dive into contract negotiations and dispel any lingering doubts over the captain's status.\n\nFOLLOW Empire of the Kop on Instagram (@empireofthekop) HERE\n\nDespite the Reds being on a head-scratching run of 10 home games without a clean sheet in the Premier League, it's been a redemptive campaign for the 32-year-old, who's been immense in the team's resurgence since last summer, with Champions League qualification safely assured with matches to spare.\n\nEven with the responsibility of captaining his country at Euro 2024 in a few weeks' time, it seems that Van Dijk is ready to sit down with Liverpool chiefs and hopefully come to a swift agreement which'll see him remain an integral part of the team for another few years.", "source": {"uri": "empireofthekop.com", "dataType": "news",

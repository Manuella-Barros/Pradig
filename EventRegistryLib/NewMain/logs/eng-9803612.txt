Out of them, eight have passed away, 14 were discharged or in some manner have come back with the government's assistance and \"there are 69 Indian citizens awaiting release from the Russian army,\" he added.\n\nOut of the eight who died, the mortal remains of four have been sent back to India and in two cases -- one from Haryana and Punjab -- DNA samples have been sent to the Russian side. In one case from Gujarat, the family wants the body to be cremated in Russia and in another case from Uttar Pradesh, the mortal remains are being brought back.\n\nAccording to Jaishankar, the problem is that the Russian authorities maintain that these Indian nationals entered into contracts for services with the Russian army.\n\n\"We are not necessarily subscribing to that... I think in many cases there are reasons to indicate that our nationals were misled, that they were told that they were going for some other job and then they were deployed with the Russian army,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of Indian nationals recruited into the Russian army was taken up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin last month.\n\n\"We take this issue very very seriously.

So far, 650 Indian nationals have been repatriated from Cambodia, 415 from Myanmar and 548 from Laos.\n\n\"The government appreciates the gravity of the issue and this is an issue for which we have to be very vigilant and we have to crack down very hard,\" he added.\n\nEmphasising that it is not a political matter but a case where the state government concerned and the Union government should work together, Jaishankar said, \"Wherever we find evidence of any infraction of the law, we will very vigorously prosecute the agents\".

He said that 91 Indians were recruited, with 69 still awaiting release, 14 discharged and 8 deceased. Jaishankar said that many of these people were misled into contracts with the Russian military.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin and secured an assurance for their release. Apart from that, Jaishankar addressed concerns about cyber trafficking in Southeast Asia, saying that 1,613 Indians have been repatriated from Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.

Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha on Friday (August 9, 2024). Noting that 69 Indians are still awaiting release from the Russian Army, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had \"personally\" raised the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow last month\n\n\"The Prime Minister got President Putin's assurance that any Indian national who is in the service of the Russian Army will be discharged and released. We should not jump the gun and say the Russians are not serious on this matter. It is important to hold the Russian government to their word; we are here to get back those 69 Indian citizens because Indians citizens should not be serving in the army of foreign countries,\" Mr. Jaishankar said.\n\nHe was replying to pointed questions from AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi who asked whether the government would stop buying oil from Russia if the Russian government was not taking the matter seriously.\n\nRepatriation in progress\n\nThe Hindu had reported first on February 20 that Indians who travelled to Russia on tourist visas were offered jobs as security helpers, but were forced to fight alongside the Russian military on the Russia-Ukraine border.\n\nThe Minister said the government is now facilitating their repatriation. \"Fourteen out of 91 Indians have been discharged or in some manner have come back with our assistance. Out of eight Indians who died in Russia, the mortal remains of four of them have been sent to India with the payment made from Indian community welfare fund. In one case from Haryana, the Russian Foreign Ministry has sought a DNA test report to identify [the body]; this has been sent to Russia. In one case relating to a person from Gujarat, the family wants cremation in Russia, and necessary authorisation from the family has been taken. In the case from Punjab, Russia has requested for a DNA sample, it is being provided. Finally, in the case of Uttar Pradesh, the family has wished that the mortal remains should be brought back,\" Mr. Jaishankar said.\n\nTraffickers booked\n\nThe Minister added that the Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a criminal case against 19 individuals and entities and the agency has examined 14 people who have returned from Russia. \"Sufficient evidence has surfaced against 10 human traffickers whose identities we know. During the investigation, two of the accused were arrested on April 24 and two more on May 7. All the four accused are presently in judicial custody,\" he said.\n\nMr. Jaishankar added that 1,613 Indians forced into cyber trafficking have been repatriated from Southeast Asia.\n\n\"Another issue is cyber trafficking of people, who are being misled, taken to Southeast Asia and made to work on cyber scams and related issues. So far, 650 Indian nationals have been repatriated from Cambodia, 415 from Myanmar and 548 from Laos... This is an issue for which we have to be very vigilant, we have to crack down very hard. We have taken it up with all the concerned governments at a political level,\" he said.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ground_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian Ground Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

To cover the cost of travel to Russia, Moun's brother sold the family's one-acre land for 11.5 lakh rupees, or nearly $14,000.\n\nOnce he arrived, however, Ajay says Moun was inducted into the Russian military to fight in the war in Ukraine instead, which has been ongoing since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022. Moun last spoke to his family on March 12, telling them he had been digging trenches to bury the casualties in Ukraine, which has steadily lost territory to Russia's larger army. Four months later, after his family contacted the Indian Embassy to inquire about his whereabouts on July 21, they learned he had been killed on the frontlines.\n\nMoun's death came days after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of Indian mercenaries with Putin during a visit to Moscow on July 8. Following Modi's visit, a spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that at least 50 Indian nationals had contacted the ministry with requests to end their employment in the Russian army. \"The Russian side have responded positively to our request. Both sides are working for an early discharge of Indian nationals and hopefully they will come back soon,\" Randhir Jaiswal said during a press briefing.\n\nRead More: Why Modi and Putin Are Friends\n\nThe news that Indian men were fighting in Russia was first reported in early March when the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said it had uncovered a \"major human trafficking network\" extending from the Indian capital of New Delhi to the southern state of Tamil Nadu. According to the CBI, Russia used social media platforms and local agents to lure people to the country by offering them jobs, admissions to \"dubious private universities,\" and \"free discounted\" visa extensions. Once the men arrived, their passports were taken away and they were \"trained in combat roles and deployed at front bases in Russia-Ukraine War Zone against their wishes,\" the CBI said.\n\nThose entrapped included a Kashmiri man named Azad Yousuf Kumar, a 31-year-old engineering graduate from Pulwama, who left last December after a YouTuber offered him a job in Dubai. \"They are constructing bunkers in the forests right now. They have moved further from the Black Sea,\" his brother Sajad told the Press Trust of India in March, saying that Kumar could call his family only for a few minutes in the evenings. \"He has a two-and-a-half-month-old son whom he has not even met so far,\" he continued, pleading with the Indian government to intervene.\n\nOn social media, one video showed another seven Indian men in Russian uniforms crying for help, claiming that they were forced to fight for the Russian army after being threatened with a 10-year jail sentence for illegally entering the country if they refused to do so.\n\nLater that month, the MEA confirmed the deaths of two Indian nationals killed on the frontlines, followed by another two deaths in June. India's Foreign Minister, S Jaishankar, raised the issue during a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Astana in July. In Moscow's first comments on the matter following Modi's visit, the Russian Embassy in India said Russia was committed to finding the \"earliest possible solution.\" (Neither Indian nor Russian officials responded to TIME's request for comment.)\n\nIndia is not the only country whose nationals have joined the Russian army to fight Ukraine. Several Sri Lankan and Nepali citizens were also drawn in by what experts from the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation (ORF) describe as a set of \"push-pull\" factors that are fueling \"this foreign fighters phenomenon.\" That includes \"the demand for foreign labor in Russia, economic incentives, and the militarization of South Asian societies,\" according to the ORF. \"The prospect of higher wages and an easy pathway to citizenship lures people to immigrate to countries like Russia, where there is a huge demand for labor and a demographic crisis,\" ORF expert Rajoli Siddharth Jayaprakash tells TIME.\n\nOutward migration from South Asia has especially increased in recent years, following the 2022 economic crisis in Sri Lanka, a recession in Nepal, and soaring unemployment in India, where the unemployment rate shot up to 9.2% in June 2024, a sharp increase from 7% in May 2024, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. In Russia, this migration fills the urgent demand for foreign labor after the country saw a shortage of 4.8 million workers in 2023.\n\nRead More: Why Indian Voters See Job Creation as the Election's Biggest Issue\n\nNevertheless, Jayaprakash says that Modi's visit to Russia has been seen as a success in India. After the issue was raised with Russian authorities on various levels, the number of Indians serving in the Russian army has declined from over 100 to 63 -- and 12 Indians have been discharged so far.\n\nBut the affair is far from over: \"Considering that the Indians signed a legally binding contract with the Russian army, which may even entail a clause for attaining Russian citizenship, the matter is quite complicated,\" Jayaprakash says.\n\nDespite attempts to secure the release of Indian nationals from the frontlines, India has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and abstained from all related resolutions at the United Nations. Instead, Modi has opted for a softer approach to the conflict, telling Putin that \"today's era is not an era of war\" during the sidelines of a regional summit in Uzbekistan in 2022. The response is in line with the close relationship that New Delhi and Moscow have enjoyed for decades, with India recently stepping up its purchase of cheap Russian oil despite protests from the West.\n\nBut in Moun's village in Haryana, his family is still grieving. His cousin, Sonu Mator, told Reuters that the family had to ask the Indian government to assist with repatriating Moun's body back to India following his death, as they didn't have the money to do so. \"If he knew he would have to fight, he would not have gone...why would he go where death could be waiting?\" Mator said.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "astha_rajvanshi@time.com", "name": "Astha Rajvanshi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ground_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian Ground Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercenary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

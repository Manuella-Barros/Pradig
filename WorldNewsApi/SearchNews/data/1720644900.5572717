The League has attracted players from around the country with matches programmed to treat spectators to some exhilarating displays on Saturday and Sunday. NPCA Women\u2019s Rep Bhavisha Shah sounded quick febrile in the run up to the weekend\u2019s fixtures. \u201cThis is actually the first time NPCA women\u2019s league is taking place and we are all overly excited for what the weekend brings,\u201d said Bhavisha, adding: \u201cWe have 8 teams with 15 players in each squad. All players are very excited and looking forward to the kick off.\u201d \u201cRuaraka Sports Club, on the coming Saturday and Sunday will host the initial matches. Nevertheless, the venue for rest of the fixtures will be finalized soon, as weather doesn\u2019t seem to be good at the present. All in all, excitement is palpable that a women\u2019s cricket League is set to transform the sport with the advent of the new concept at NPCA.\u201d Bhavisha and Lydiah Kaparo are the two women\u2019s representatives at NPCA coopted into its Executive Committee to drum up support for the much-anticipated ladies\u2019 game. The NPCA Women\u2019s League was programmed to start earlier in the year but was rescheduled as a result of torrential rains which have been pounding several parts of the country over the past three months rendering several venues unplayable. NPCA Hon. Secretary Narendra \u201cNK\u201d Patel says the upcoming League is a huge development for cricket in the country. \u201cFemale cricketers in the country will stick to the sport for a duration they\u2019ll rack up requisite exposure, and it will only benefit cricket in the longer run,\u201d NK remarked. As the countdown continues, Bavisha is excited by the fact that most players, more so, the ones playing on Saturday are new. Eight matches will be on the cards this weekend at Ruaraka Sports venue. On Saturday, Silver Cheetahs and Nairobi Titans will be the first teams to grace the event at 2:30. Whoever gets to bat first will depend on the toss. In another match, Shree Cutchi Leva Patel Samaj (SCLPS) ladies\u2019 side will take on Nairobi Warriors whilst the latter will be at it against Nairobi Titans. The last match on Saturday June 8 will start at 5:30 pitting Silver Cheetahs against Samaj women\u2019s team. Action continues on Sunday, June 9 with South Zone Queens taking on Stray Impalas at 9:30am. This will be followed by a match pitting Stray Panthers against Samaj at 10.30am South Zone Babes will be at it at 11:30 Sunday with a fixture against Nairobi Titans. Silver Cheetah verses Nairobi Warriors is what will bring down the curtains to the weekend\u2019s schedule at 12:30. \u201cStandards have been set and only the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d quipped Bhavisha in finality. After the opening week, action continues on the weekend of June 15-16.", "summary": "<p>A game-changing moment for women\u2019s cricket is in the offing as the inaugural Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) T10 League heads to Ruaraka Sports ground.

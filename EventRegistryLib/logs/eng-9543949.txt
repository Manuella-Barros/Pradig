And soon enough, they may have a new head of personnel.\n\nSources tell CBS Sports the Patriots are moving forward with a search for their next top football executive, a role that would amount to what's typically known in the NFL as a general manager. It's unclear what the title would be, but sources believe the position would outrank all other football positions in the building.\n\nFor years, Bill Belichick not only served as head coach but what is known technically at the NFL league office as the \"primary football executive.\" Following his departure in January after 24 years as head coach, the Patriots had a vacant primary football executive, as that title did not transfer over to new head coach Jerod Mayo, sources told CBS Sports in February.\n\nEliot Wolf, the Patriots' director of scouting, has been at the controls of the team's personnel department since Belichick's departure. He is considered a candidate for this role, and his work over the past four months will be key in his evaluation.\n\nBut team owner Robert Kraft couldn't simply name Wolf the primary football executive even if he wanted to. League rules dictated the team had to go through the process to, at the very least, comply with the Rooney Rule, which meant the Patriots must interview at least two external minority candidates in person before hiring someone.\n\nKraft said in January he planned to stick with his internal group for the time being but never ruled out an eventual search.\n\n\"We have a lot of people internally who have had a chance to train and learn under the greatest coach of all-time and a man whose football intellect is very special,\" Kraft said. \"So, in the short-term, we're looking for collaboration. Our team has a tremendous opportunity to position itself right, given our salary cap space, and we've never drafted, in my 30 years of ownership, we've never been drafting as [high] as we're drafting.\n\n\"So we're counting on our internal people, whom we're still learning and evaluating. So we're going to let that evolve and develop, and before the key decisions have to be made, we will appoint someone.\"\n\nThere was plenty of doubt around the league that a search would even take place this offseason.\n\nTypically teams make changes at the top of their personnel department at the conclusion of the season, but it's not unheard of for teams to wait until after the draft to make the switch. In 2017, the Bills hired Brandon Beane after that year's draft. In July of that same year, the Chiefs parted ways with John Dorsey as their GM, just a few months after he engineered a trade with the Bills to move up in the first round and draft Patrick Mahomes.\n\nBut Kraft hasn't had to run a coaching or GM search in a quarter century. Mayo had a provision in his contract that allowed him to ascend to the head-coaching spot once Belichick left, which is what took place in January. And while several men have aided Belichick in personnel matters, not one has had an official GM title, nor has there ever been an official search.\n\nEven the 2000 search for a head coach that resulted in Belichick landing in New England was hardly a search at all, with Kraft identifying Belichick early in the process and eventually working out a trade with the Jets for the coach.\n\nWolf took over and quickly hired Alonzo Highsmith for a senior personnel role. Highsmith and Wolf knew each other from their time in Green Bay, and CBS Sports reported Highsmith came to help the Patriots transition their grading system for players, among other roles.\n\nWolf navigated free agency for New England, too. He signed offensive lineman Mike Onwenu (three years, $57 million), tight end Hunter Henry (three years, $30 million), safety Kyle Dugger (four years, $58 million) and defensive tackle Christian Barmore (four years, $92 million) in the largest non-Tom Brady contract in franchise history.\n\nAnd in April's draft, Wolf rebuffed offers from the Giants and Vikings for the No. 3 overall pick, and the Patriots used the selection to draft future-of-the-franchise Drake Maye at quarterback.\n\nAll of those moves will impact the next several years of Patriots football, and now this search could result in someone else being at the top.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_jones@cbssports.com", "name": "Jonathan Jones",

When Belichick and the Patriots parted ways in January, however, he left his position as their quasi-general manager unoccupied.\n\nWhether or not the Patriots will name an official GM in Year 1 after Belichick remains to be seen. Fact is, however, that they currently lack what the NFL refers to as a \"primary football executive.\"\n\nEliot Wolf is the closest they have to that role at the moment. Listed as director of scouting, a title he was given by Belichick in 2022, he took charge of the front office after his former boss left New England. Spearheading a collaborative effort that also included fellow executives Matt Groh, Alonzo Highsmith and Patrick Stewart, Wolf was given authority to make the final call on personnel decisions in both free agency and the draft.\n\nConsidering his involvement in the Patriots' roster and salary cap construction over the last four months, especially in regards to drafting quarterback Drake Maye third overall, Wolf has to be considered a serious candidate if not the outright frontrunner to get the job. However, the NFL rules prevent him from simply taking over as primary executive.\n\nPer the so-called Rooney Rule, the Patriots have to hold at least at least two in-person interviews with external minority candidates for the open position. This means that simply talking to the aforementioned Alonzo Highsmith or other minority executives already in the building would not help satisfy those requirements.\n\nBack in January, team owner Robert Kraft hinted at a formal search for a new head of football operations would eventually take place.\n\n\"We're counting on our internal people whom we're still learning and evaluating,\" said Kraft at the time. \"We're going to let that evolve and develop, and before the key decisions have to be made, we will appoint someone. At the same time, we'll probably start doing interviews and looking at people from the outside. But my bias has always been, in all our family companies, to try to develop a culture from within where we understand one another. ...\n\n\"This is the first time in a quarter of a century we had to make major changes, and we want to see what we have in-house, look what's out there in the marketplace, and then do what we think is right.\"\n\nKraft's remarks came at the introductory press conference of new head coach Jerod Mayo. A former linebacker and assistant coach under Belichick, Mayo took over without a coaching search. This was made possible due to his contract with the Patriots guaranteeing that he would eventually succeed Belichick.\n\nNeither Wolf nor any other member of the Patriots' front office has such a stipulation in their deals with the club.

It's unknown if the next person tabbed to lead the team's front office will have the GM title, but the conclusion of this process will result in an individual having the power to run the Patriots personnel department.\n\nUp until now, that person has been Eliot Wolf. The 42-year-old came to New England in 2020 as a consultant and worked as the director of scouting for the last two seasons. After Jerod Mayo was hired to replace Bill Belichick as the Patriots head coach, owner Robert Kraft made Wolf the team's de facto general manager.\n\nMultiple well-known general manager candidates have told MassLive they'd be interested in this job, but this search process may end with Wolf getting a new title. Although this situation is unique, there are people inside Gillette Stadium and those on different NFL teams who expect Wolf will come away with the job, according to multiple sources.\n\nOne explanation for this search is that for the Patriots to give Wolf the GM title (or another title), the franchise does have to abide by the NFL's hiring policy. Most notably, the Patriots must adhere to the NFL's Rooney Rule. In 2009, the policy was amended to include general manager and primary football executive jobs. That means teams are required to interview a minimum of two external minority candidates before naming a GM.\n\nOne theory as to why the Patriots have just started this process is that they wanted to give Wolf the entire offseason to work with the new staff as opposed to interviewing candidates after they hired Mayo. Had they done that, moves in the front office would've been delayed until the search was concluded. That includes preparing for the draft, which the Patriots did right away as opposed to running a GM search first.\n\nThis situation also isn't a surprise to Wolf. Kraft made his intentions clear this offseason and confirmed at the NFL Owners Meetings that the Patriots will search for a new front-office leader after the conclusion of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\n\"I think they're in tune, and I'm excited, I mean, some people call me an eternal optimist, so I don't know how much you should take what I say, but I'm excited about what's going on and the process,\" Kraft said about Wolf and his front office. \"And they're thorough. They're very thorough. I'm excited with what I've seen so far, and we'll evaluate after the draft and see how that's gone and decide where we go from there.\"\n\nAt the NFL Combine, multiple sources told MassLive that the Patriots were expected to conduct interviews after the draft for a high-ranking front office position. According to sources, there are multiple experienced candidates interested in running the Patriots personnel department.\n\nAfter Mayo was hired, multiple potential external candidates reached out to the new Patriots head coach to let him know they were interested, per sources.\n\nHowever, it would be a surprise if this process ended up with anyone else but Wolf at the top of the Patriots front office.\n\nThis offseason, the Patriots allowed Wolf to work in free agency with the most cap space in the NFL. Then, Wolf was tasked with the most important decision in recent Patriots franchise history when he drafted Drake Maye with the No. 3 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. Most recently, Wolf signed Christian Barmore to a massive four-year contract extension.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the Patriots roster has 89 players, so after letting Wolf sign free agents, make drafts, and run the draft, it'd be surprising to several people inside Gillette Stadium if he doesn't get a promotion.\n\nJonathan Jones of CBS Sports was the first to report the news of the Patriots starting their search for a top football executive.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rooney Rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillette_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gillette Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/BU6L5KZDMRDLLCGK6J6IQFJ6LU.jpg?auth=2cb2cc2eb3fe81ec48f7530bc32062438801b96087b563ac316f1961becbbfc6&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543949", "eventUri": "eng-9543949", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

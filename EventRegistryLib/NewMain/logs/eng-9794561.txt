And Mr Amaad himself has undergone an interview process to join the GMP.\"\n\nAt the press conference, photographs were distributed which showed bruising to the left side of Mrs Akhtar's face - said to have been sustained in what the family described as the \"pandemonium\" that broke out at the pay station.\n\nMrs Akhtar attempted to pull her son's head away after the apparent stamping and thought the officer \"could have killed her son at that point\", said Mr Anwar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"The male it is alleged as seen in the video then kneels down on Fahir placing his knee on his back whilst he is still limp and he then looks up straight at Mrs Akhtar.\n\n\"At this point, the male officer still has his Taser drawn, then using his right hand in which he has his Taser it is alleged he strikes Mrs Akhtar directly in the face using his Taser as a weapon. At this point Mrs Akhtar screamed and held her face as she was terrified that she would now be subjected to the same violence as she alleges her sons were.\"\n\nShe said Mrs Akhtar later touched her face and noticed she was bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye and that she was \"dazed, crying and disorientated\".\n\nMr Anwar said no officer attended to her injuries as she and her crying, \"distressed\", six-year-old grandson were left with luggage strewn everywhere.\n\nHe said she was finally helped by a passer-by and taken home.\n\nA police officer was suspended by GMP in the wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nMr Amaaz and Mr Amaad were among four men who were arrested on suspicion of affray and assault before they were later bailed.\n\nMr Anwar said he is seeking a further meeting with IOPC regional director Catherine Bates over lodging a formal complaint against GMP officers, and also a meeting with the mayor.\n\nThe solicitor added: \"The family also wish to state that they know more than many other families that the police play a crucial role in our society and police with the consent of the people and that it is precisely why when they get it so badly wrong that they must be held to account.\n\n\"Equally when they get it right the police should be praised and the family wish to place on record their thanks to the police who for days have had to face right-wing racist thugs causing violent disorder and spreading fear across England.\"\n\nBut Mr Anwar added: \"In our democracy, we have the right to expect that those in uniform will not act as thugs and will act within the law and that any force used must be reasonable, legitimate and proportionate.\"\n\nOutlining what he said \"sparked\" the incident, Mr Anwar said Mrs Akhtar was earlier subjected to a \"tirade of alleged racist abuse\" from a fellow passenger, a male Kuwaiti national, on a Qatar Airways flight as she returned from a holiday in Pakistan.\n\nHe said: \"She was feeling unwell on the plane and as a result used the empty seat next to her to be able to sit more comfortable. Shortly after making use of the seat, she could hear a male muttering in the row behind her. At first, she paid no attention but then the male went out of his way over the course of the next several hours to subject her to a tirade of alleged racist abuse.\n\n\"He repeatedly called her a \"bitch\" and referring to her as a \"P*** bitch\". Mrs Akhtar for several hours of the flight was scared the male was going to become physical and assault her. Despite her appeals to the cabin crew they did nothing to intervene.\n\n\"She appealed to the the male to calm down but he refused to listen despite telling him she was unwell. He was towering over her and hurling abuse. It was a mixture of abuse in English and Arabic.\n\n\"The male's wife intervened and told him to stop and asked him to sit down; however, the male continued and his children were ridiculing Mrs Akhtar.\"\n\nShe claimed the male later used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her as she headed towards the baggage claim area.\n\nMrs Akhtar saw her two sons and grandchild when she exited arrivals and \"broke down into tears\", said Mr Anwar, and recounted her ordeal.\n\nShe later noticed the male passenger as they walked past Terminal 2's Starbucks cafe.\n\nMr Anwar said: \"Both her sons approached the male and questioned him regarding the abuse. The male was rude and proceeded to laugh in her sons' faces. An altercation then took place.\"\n\nThe family then headed towards the car park area.\n\nMr Anwar said he had previously raised concerns at GMP's \"failure\" to investigate an alleged hate crime against Mrs Akhtar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"GMP confirmed a few days ago that following investigation they believed there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.\n\n\"The individual who was a Kuwaiti national will be allowed to return home today.\n\n\"Mrs Akhtar feels betrayed and once again let down by the failure of GMP to act.\"\n\nGMP has appealed for any witnesses to the altercation on Qatar Airways flight QR023, which arrived at 7.20pm, the second \"violent\" altercation at Starbucks at 8.22pm and the incident at the car park paypoint area at 8.28pm.\n\nIn a statement, GMP said: \"Investigations into incidents that occurred at Manchester Airport on July 23 are ongoing.\n\n\"We are fully co-operating with the independent investigation reviewing police conduct, whilst actively pursuing lines of inquiry into three incidents.\n\n\"We have obtained all relevant CCTV footage and are continuing to appeal for witnesses.\n\n\"If you have any information or

And Mr Amaad himself has undergone an interview process to join the GMP.\"\n\nAt the press conference, photographs were distributed which showed bruising to the left side of Mrs Akhtar's face - said to have been sustained in what the family described as the \"pandemonium\" that broke out at the pay station.\n\nMrs Akhtar attempted to pull her son's head away after the apparent stamping and thought the officer \"could have killed her son at that point\", said Mr Anwar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"The male it is alleged as seen in the video then kneels down on Fahir placing his knee on his back whilst he is still limp and he then looks up straight at Mrs Akhtar.\n\n\"At this point, the male officer still has his Taser drawn, then using his right hand in which he has his Taser it is alleged he strikes Mrs Akhtar directly in the face using his Taser as a weapon. At this point Mrs Akhtar screamed and held her face as she was terrified that she would now be subjected to the same violence as she alleges her sons were.\"\n\nShe said Mrs Akhtar later touched her face and noticed she was bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye and that she was \"dazed, crying and disorientated\".\n\nMr Anwar said no officer attended to her injuries as she and her crying, \"distressed\", six-year-old grandson were left with luggage strewn everywhere.\n\nHe said she was finally helped by a passer-by and taken home.\n\nA police officer was suspended by GMP in the wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nMr Amaaz and Mr Amaad were among four men who were arrested on suspicion of affray and assault before they were later bailed.\n\nMr Anwar said he is seeking a further meeting with IOPC regional director Catherine Bates over lodging a formal complaint against GMP officers, and also a meeting with the mayor.\n\nThe solicitor added: \"The family also wish to state that they know more than many other families that the police play a crucial role in our society and police with the consent of the people and that it is precisely why when they get it so badly wrong that they must be held to account.\n\n\"Equally when they get it right the police should be praised and the family wish to place on record their thanks to the police who for days have had to face right-wing racist thugs causing violent disorder and spreading fear across England.\"\n\nBut Mr Anwar added: \"In our democracy, we have the right to expect that those in uniform will not act as thugs and will act within the law and that any force used must be reasonable, legitimate and proportionate.\"\n\nOutlining what he said \"sparked\" the incident, Mr Anwar said Mrs Akhtar was earlier subjected to a \"tirade of alleged racist abuse\" from a fellow passenger, a male Kuwaiti national, on a Qatar Airways flight as she returned from a holiday in Pakistan.\n\nHe said: \"She was feeling unwell on the plane and as a result used the empty seat next to her to be able to sit more comfortable. Shortly after making use of the seat, she could hear a male muttering in the row behind her. At first, she paid no attention but then the male went out of his way over the course of the next several hours to subject her to a tirade of alleged racist abuse.\n\n\"He repeatedly called her a \"bitch\" and referring to her as a \"P*** bitch\". Mrs Akhtar for several hours of the flight was scared the male was going to become physical and assault her. Despite her appeals to the cabin crew they did nothing to intervene.\n\n\"She appealed to the the male to calm down but he refused to listen despite telling him she was unwell. He was towering over her and hurling abuse. It was a mixture of abuse in English and Arabic.\n\n\"The male's wife intervened and told him to stop and asked him to sit down; however, the male continued and his children were ridiculing Mrs Akhtar.\"\n\nShe claimed the male later used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her as she headed towards the baggage claim area.\n\nMrs Akhtar saw her two sons and grandchild when she exited arrivals and \"broke down into tears\", said Mr Anwar, and recounted her ordeal.\n\nShe later noticed the male passenger as they walked past Terminal 2's Starbucks cafe.\n\nMr Anwar said: \"Both her sons approached the male and questioned him regarding the abuse. The male was rude and proceeded to laugh in her sons' faces. An altercation then took place.\"\n\nThe family then headed towards the car park area.\n\nMr Anwar said he had previously raised concerns at GMP's \"failure\" to investigate an alleged hate crime against Mrs Akhtar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"GMP confirmed a few days ago that following investigation they believed there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.\n\n\"The individual who was a Kuwaiti national will be allowed to return home today.\n\n\"Mrs Akhtar feels betrayed and once again let down by the failure of GMP to act.\"\n\nGMP has appealed for any witnesses to the altercation on Qatar Airways flight QR023, which arrived at 7.20pm, the second \"violent\" altercation at Starbucks at 8.22pm and the incident at the car park paypoint area at 8.28pm.",

She was feeling unwell and tried to move away from the man who she said was intimidating her.\n\nAfter disembarking the aircraft, she was upset and collected the wrong luggage at the carousel, only realising when she got home.\n\nThe press conference heard the distressed mum met her sons, who had come to pick her up at the airport alongside her six-year-old grandson. She explained what had happened on board and said her sons spoke to the man before leaving towards the car park where the altercation with police then began.\n\nThe family say they were shocked by the level of violence used by the police.\n\nThe family's lawyer says the mum was shouting in Urdu: \"They have killed my son\", after she saw her son tasered.\n\nMr Anwar claims both brothers were compliant before the officer stamped on his head and the mum believed her son was dying as he was \"limp\". They claim the mother was struck in the face by the officer with the Taser gun.\n\nA photo showing bruising on the 56-year-old mother's face was shown to the press conference. Reporters were told she feared she was about to receive the same treatment that her son's had been subjected to, the lawyer said.\n\nThe family say Fahir Amaaz was called a \"dirty f****** c**t\" by a police officer who did not have his bodycam on.\n\nMr Anwar, said they had already spoken with the police watchdog IOPC last week, with a view to calling for an investigation into the officers involved.\n\nMeanwhile, the police constable in the video has been told he was under criminal investigation for assault, the IOPC has confirmed.\n\nMayor Andy Burnham has advised the Manchester public to allow the probe into the incident to take its course after he was shown the full video.\n\nThe family is demanding to know \"on what legal basis\" the video should be shown to a politician before they were given an opportunity to see it.\n\nMr Anwar said that, while any of the family found to be engaged in criminality should be \"subjected to due process\", there should \"never be any legal justification\" for the use of \"excessive, disproportionate and potentially lethal force against a civilian who is incapacitated and poses no threat\".\n\nThe lawyer also demanded to know why CCTV from the airport had been leaked and raised concerns over the 'false narrative' being created by police sources.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, August 1, Mr Anwar said: \"I have now spoken to the IOPC with regards to lodging a formal complaint against officers from Greater Manchester Police.\"\n\nHe added: \"We also seek to understand on what legal basis Andy Burnham was shown the complete CCTV and by whom.

They say they will have been left devastated and traumatised by the events at Manchester Airport and members of their family are serving police officers with Greater Manchester Police.\n\nFootage went viral from inside Terminal 2 showing one of the men kicked in the head, before a second leaked clip emerged, which shed more light on the moments before, showing the man throwing punches at a male officer near a ticket machine inside one of the airport's car parks. GMP confirmed that three officers sustained head injuries and a broken nose in the fight, saying the violence in the viral video had been \"the last of three altercations\" in just over one hour.\n\nIn the press conference the family's lawyer have explained what took place on the plane before it landed at Manchester. The lawyer has claimed the mother was racially abused onboard a Qatar Airways plane and she was called a \"p**i\". She was feeling extremely unwell and tried to move away from the man who she said was intimidating her. She was upset and collected the wrong luggage at the carousel, only realising when she got home.\n\nThe press conference was told, the mother told her sons, who had come to pick her up, and they spotted the man she said had racially abused her. They spoke to the man before leaving towards the car park where the altercation with police began. The family say they were shocked by the level of violence by the police.\n\nScottish human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar, representing the family, said they had already spoken with the police watchdog IOPC last week, with a view to calling for an investigation into the officers involved. Meanwhile, the police constable in the video has been told he was under criminal investigation for assault, the IOPC has confirmed.\n\nManchester Mayor Andy Burnham has advised the public to allow the investigation to take its course after he was shown the full video. The family have now demanded to know \"on what legal basis\" the video should be shown to a politician before they were given an opportunity to see it. Mr Anwar said that, while any of the family found to be engaged in criminality should be \"subjected to due process\", there should \"never be any legal justification\" for the use of \"excessive, disproportionate and potentially lethal force against a civilian who is incapacitated and poses no threat\".\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, August 1, Mr Anwar said: \"I have now spoken to the IOPC with regards to lodging a formal complaint against officers from Greater Manchester Police.\" He added: \"We also seek to understand on what legal basis Andy Burnham was shown the complete CCTV and by whom. The repeated attempts by so-called 'police sources' to spin a false narrative or partial context is deeply unhelpful to an IOPC investigation. Leaked footage does not show exactly what the police did, how the incident unfolded, nor the full conduct of officers in the aftermath of the incident in all parts of the airport, including after the arrests.\n\n\"As for leaking of CCTV, we understand that will also form part of their investigation, but whilst it may be blatantly obvious who would benefit from such a cynical and partial leak, proving who the individual or 'institution' is likely to be impossible.\" The two brothers at the centre of the video were initially going to be represented by TikTok lawyer Akhmed Yakoob, although cut ties earlier this week for reasons the lawyer declined to give.\n\nMr Anwar has now said the family were calling for all footage and material relating to the incident to be retained, \"especially those where the detainees were taken to in other areas of the airport\".

wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nMr Amaaz and Mr

At this point Mrs Akhtar screamed and held her face as she was terrified that she would now be subjected to the same violence as she alleges her sons were.\"\n\nShe said Mrs Akhtar later touched her face and noticed she was bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye and that she was \"dazed, crying and disorientated\".\n\nMr Anwar said no officer attended to her injuries as she and her crying, \"distressed\", six-year-old grandson were left with luggage strewn everywhere.\n\nHe said she was finally helped by a passer-by and taken home.\n\nA police officer was suspended by GMP in the wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nMr Amaaz and Mr Amaad were among four men who were arrested on suspicion of affray and assault before they were later bailed.\n\nMr Anwar said he is seeking a further meeting with IOPC regional director Catherine Bates over lodging a formal complaint against GMP officers, and also a meeting with the mayor.\n\nThe solicitor added: \"The family also wish to state that they know more than many other families that the police play a crucial role in our society and police with the consent of the people and that it is precisely why when they get it so badly wrong that they must be held to account.\n\n\"Equally when they get it right the police should be praised and the family wish to place on record their thanks to the police who for days have had to face right-wing racist thugs causing violent disorder and spreading fear across England.\"\n\nBut Mr Anwar added: \"In our democracy, we have the right to expect that those in uniform will not act as thugs and will act within the law and that any force used must be reasonable, legitimate and proportionate.\"\n\nOutlining what he said \"sparked\" the incident, Mr Anwar said Mrs Akhtar was earlier subjected to a \"tirade of alleged racist abuse\" from a fellow passenger, a male Kuwaiti national, on a Qatar Airways flight as she returned from a holiday in Pakistan.\n\nHe said: \"She was feeling unwell on the plane and as a result used the empty seat next to her to be able to sit more comfortable. Shortly after making use of the seat, she could hear a male muttering in the row behind her. At first, she paid no attention but then the male went out of his way over the course of the next several hours to subject her to a tirade of alleged racist abuse.\n\n\"He repeatedly called her a \"bitch\" and referring to her as a \"P*** bitch\". Mrs Akhtar for several hours of the flight was scared the male was going to become physical and assault her. Despite her appeals to the cabin crew they did nothing to intervene.\n\n\"She appealed to the the male to calm down but he refused to listen despite telling him she was unwell. He was towering over her and hurling abuse. It was a mixture of abuse in English and Arabic.\n\n\"The male's wife intervened and told him to stop and asked him to sit down; however, the male continued and his children were ridiculing Mrs Akhtar.\"\n\nShe claimed the male later used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her as she headed towards the baggage claim area.\n\nMrs Akhtar saw her two sons and grandchild when she exited arrivals and \"broke down into tears\", said Mr Anwar, and recounted her ordeal.\n\nShe later noticed the male passenger as they walked past Terminal 2's Starbucks cafe.\n\nMr Anwar said: \"Both her sons approached the male and questioned him regarding the abuse. The male was rude and proceeded to laugh in her sons' faces. An altercation then took place.\"\n\nThe family then headed towards the car park area.\n\nMr Anwar said he had previously raised concerns at GMP's \"failure\" to investigate an alleged hate crime against Mrs Akhtar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"GMP confirmed a few days ago that following investigation they believed there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.\n\n\"The individual who was a Kuwaiti national will be allowed to return home today.\n\n\"Mrs Akhtar feels betrayed and once again let down by the failure of GMP to act.\"\n\nGMP has appealed for any witnesses

And Mr Amaad himself has undergone an interview process to join the GMP.\"\n\nAt the press conference, photographs were distributed which showed bruising to the left side of Mrs Akhtar's face - said to have been sustained in what the family described as the \"pandemonium\" that broke out at the pay station.\n\nMrs Akhtar attempted to pull her son's head away after the apparent stamping and thought the officer \"could have killed her son at that point\", said Mr Anwar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"The male it is alleged as seen in the video then kneels down on Fahir placing his knee on his back whilst he is still limp and he then looks up straight at Mrs Akhtar.\n\n\"At this point, the male officer still has his Taser drawn, then using his right hand in which he has his Taser it is alleged he strikes Mrs Akhtar directly in the face using his Taser as a weapon. At this point Mrs Akhtar screamed and held her face as she was terrified that she would now be subjected to the same violence as she alleges her sons were.\"\n\nShe said Mrs Akhtar later touched her face and noticed she was bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye and that she was \"dazed, crying and disorientated\".\n\nMr Anwar said no officer attended to her injuries as she and her crying, \"distressed\", six-year-old grandson were left with luggage strewn everywhere.\n\nHe said she was finally helped by a passer-by and taken home.\n\nA police officer was suspended by GMP in the wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nMr Amaaz and Mr Amaad were among four men who were arrested on suspicion of affray and assault before they were later bailed.\n\nMr Anwar said he is seeking a further meeting with IOPC regional director Catherine Bates over lodging a formal complaint against GMP officers, and also a meeting with the mayor.\n\nThe solicitor added: \"The family also wish to state that they know more than many other families that the police play a crucial role in our society and police with the consent of the people and that it is precisely why when they get it so badly wrong that they must be held to account.\n\n\"Equally when they get it right the police should be praised and the family wish to place on record their thanks to the police who for days have had to face right-wing racist thugs causing violent disorder and spreading fear across England.\"\n\nBut Mr Anwar added: \"In our democracy, we have the right to expect that those in uniform will not act as thugs and will act within the law and that any force used must be reasonable, legitimate and proportionate.\"\n\nOutlining what he said \"sparked\" the incident, Mr Anwar said Mrs Akhtar was earlier subjected to a \"tirade of alleged racist abuse\" from a fellow passenger, a male Kuwaiti national, on a Qatar Airways flight as she returned from a holiday in Pakistan.\n\nHe said: \"She was feeling unwell on the plane and as a result used the empty seat next to her to be able to sit more comfortable. Shortly after making use of the seat, she could hear a male muttering in the row behind her. At first, she paid no attention but then the male went out of his way over the course of the next several hours to subject her to a tirade of alleged racist abuse.\n\n\"He repeatedly called her a \"bitch\" and referring to her as a \"P*** bitch\". Mrs Akhtar for several hours of the flight was scared the male was going to become physical and assault her. Despite her appeals to the cabin crew they did nothing to intervene.\n\n\"She appealed to the the male to calm down but he refused to listen despite telling him she was unwell. He was towering over her and hurling abuse. It was a mixture of abuse in English and Arabic.\n\n\"The male's wife intervened and told him to stop and asked him to sit down; however, the male continued and his children were ridiculing Mrs Akhtar.\"\n\nShe claimed the male later used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her as she headed towards the baggage claim area.\n\nMrs Akhtar saw her two sons and grandchild when she exited arrivals and \"broke down into tears\", said Mr Anwar, and recounted her ordeal.\n\nShe later noticed the male passenger as they walked past Terminal 2's Starbucks cafe.\n\nMr Anwar said: \"Both her sons approached the male and questioned him regarding the abuse. The male was rude and proceeded to laugh in her sons' faces. An altercation then took place.\"\n\nThe family then headed towards the car park area.\n\nMr Anwar said he had previously raised concerns at GMP's \"failure\" to investigate an alleged hate crime against Mrs Akhtar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"GMP confirmed a few days ago that following investigation they believed there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.\n\n\"The individual who was a Kuwaiti national will be allowed to return home today.\n\n\"Mrs Akhtar feels betrayed and once again let down by the failure of GMP to act.\"\n\nGMP has appealed for any witnesses to the altercation on Qatar Airways flight QR023, which arrived at 7.20pm, the second \"violent\" altercation at Starbucks at 8.22pm and the incident at the car park paypoint area at 8.28pm.",

Footage went viral from inside Terminal 2 showing Mr Amaaz, 19, being kicked in the head during the incident on July 23.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News later published a second clip, which shed more light on the moments leading to the incident. The video showed Mr Amaaz and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, appearing to throw punches at a male police officer near a ticket machine inside one of the airport's car parks.\n\nREAD MORE: Police powers to be stepped up ahead of 'protests' at Salford Precinct\n\nOther officers were involved in the drama. This morning (Tuesday), the two brothers, from Rochdale, appeared alongside their lawyer Aamer Anwar and mother at a press conference. Addressing the media gathered inside the Midland Hotel, Mr Anwar detailed the family's version of events.\n\nHe said the family wanted to 'set the record straight' and provide context about what took place at the airport. Mr Anwar alleged that prior to the altercation involving her sons and the police, Ms Akhtar was racially abused on a Qatar Airways flight back from Pakistan.\n\nA man sitting in the row behind had subjected her to a 'tirade of alleged racist abuse' and called her a 'P*** b****', he claimed. She was feeling extremely unwell and tried to move away from the man.\n\nMs Akhtar asked the man to calm down, but he continued to abuse and 'bully' her for several hours, Mr Anwar alleged. When she left the aircraft, Mr Anwar alleged the man 'used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her'. She was upset and collected the wrong luggage at the carousel, only realising when she got home.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News has put this version of events to Qatari Airlines for comment.\n\nThe press conference was told Ms Akhtar met her sons, who went to pick her up along with her six-year-old grandson and explained what had happened on board. Ms Akhtar then spotted the man she said had racially abused her.\n\n\"Both her sons approached the male and questioned him regarding the abuse,\" Mr Anwar said. The lawyer went on to claim: \"The male was rude and proceeded to laugh in her son's faces. An altercation then took place.\"\n\nMr Anwer claimed the family then left towards the car park where the altercation with police began. He said Mr Amaaz was paying for parking at a ticket machine when three police officers - two female and one male - 'grabbed him by the wrist'.\n\nIt is alleged the male police officer then 'grabbed' Mr Amaaz by the neck before hitting his head into the ticket machine.\n\nMr Anwar said the family were 'shocked at the unnecessary aggression and violence'. \"There was no attempt to speak to Fahir, to ask him to step aside, to caution him or simply say can we speak to you for a second,\" he added.\n\nMr Anwar claimed that after Mr Amaad asked the male officer to 'remove his neckhold' on his brother, he was punched in the head twice and fell to the ground.\n\nMs Akhtar was holding her son at the time and also fell to the ground, he said. Mr Anwar said the officer then fired his Taser at Mr Amaad.\n\nAs Mr Amaaz ran towards the officer, he too was tasered, Mr Anwar said. He claimed that the male police officer went to kick Mr Amaaz, who was 'lying motionless facing down', and Ms Akhtar 'tried to pull her son's head away'.\n\nHe said both brothers were 'compliant' before the officer stamped on Mr Amaaz's head and the mother believed her son was dying as he was 'limp'.\n\nMr Anwar claimed that Ms Akhtar was then hurt after an officer 'struck her directly in the face using his Taser'. The same officer then allegedly kicked her other son, Mr Amaad, before dragging him to the floor and hitting him on the head with the taser.\n\nMr Anwar said Ms Akhtar later noticed that she was 'bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye'. She was left 'lying on the ground bleeding' before a passer-by took her home.\n\nA photo showing bruising on Ms Akhtar's face was shown during the press conference.\n\nFollowing the initial altercation, Mr Anwar alleged that one of the officers kneeled down next Mr Amaad and told him: \"You dirty f****** c***, you think you can hit my officers. I am going to kill you when I see you, in my uniform or out.\"\n\nHe said that Mr Amaaz asked the officer why his body-worn camera was switched off, and the officer replied: \"I'll show you why.\"\n\nThe officer is then alleged to have 'grabbed him by the neck' before 'dragging' him around a corner and 'throwing him face first onto the floor'.\n\nMr Anwar alleged the officer then asked Mr Amaaz: \"Do you want my camera on now you dirty c***?\". He said Mr Amaaz 'feared for his life' at the time.\n\nMr Anwar told the press conference that the family had been 'subjected to horrific racist and Islamophobic abuse on social media' since the incident, and alleged that 'there has been a campaign of disinformation in an attempt to justify alleged police violence'.\n\nThe incident sparked a number of protests across Greater Manchester. However, Mr Anwar said the family was calling for people 'to remain calm' and avoid 'taking the law into their own hands'.\n\nThe family said they also seeking to meet with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to discuss the incident.\n\nMr Anwar previously said they had already spoken with the police watchdog IOPC, with a view to calling for an investigation into the officers involved. Meanwhile, the police constable in the video has been told he was under criminal investigation for assault, the IOPC has confirmed.\n\nA spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police said: \"Investigations into incidents that occurred at Manchester Airport on 23 July are ongoing, we are fully cooperating with the independent investigation reviewing police conduct, whilst actively pursuing lines of enquiry into three incidents.\n\n\"We have obtained all relevant CCTV footage and are continuing to appeal for witnesses.\n\n\"If you have any information or footage to support the police investigation, submit it through GMP's public portal: https://mipp.police.uk/operation/06GMP23S59-PO1.\"\n\nFollowing the publication of the first lot of footage, the force said: \"Officers were called to reports of an altercation between members of the public in Terminal 2 at Manchester Airport.\n\n\"Whilst attempting to arrest one of the suspects of the earlier altercation, three officers were subject to a violent assault, where they were punched to the ground. A female officer suffered a broken nose and all three were taken to hospital for treatment.\n\n\"As the attending officers were firearms officers, there was a clear risk during this assault of their firearms being taken from them.\n\n\"Four men were arrested at the scene for affray and assault on emergency service workers. We acknowledge the concerns of the conduct within the video, and our Professional Standards Directorate are assessing this.\"\n\nOn BBC Radio Manchester on Tuesday morning, Chief Constable Stephen Watson said: \"We live in a really complicated age, social media is really good at putting partial pictures into the public domain, and as a result people are quite swift to rush to judgement.\n\n\"We just need to be balanced and wait for all the facts to emerge, because the reality is the public still don't have the full facts. There's all sorts of imagery and all the rest of it that will be made available to the appropriate authorities at the appropriate time, but we don't do this in the social media space.\"\n\nThe M.E.N. has contacted Qatar Airways for comment, as well as the IOPC.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He said a man sitting in the row behind her had subjected her to a 'tirade of alleged racist abuse' and called her a 'P*** b****'.\n\nShe was feeling extremely unwell and tried to move away from the man who she said was intimidating her. She asked the man to calm down, but he continued to abuse and 'bully' her for several hours, Mr Anwar alleged.\n\nWhen she left the aircraft, Mr Anwar alleged the man 'used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her'. She was upset and collected the wrong luggage at the carousel, only realising when she got home.\n\nThe press conference was told the woman met her sons, who went to pick her up along with her grandson and explained what had happened on board. They say her sons had spotted the man she said had racially abused her. They spoke to the man before leaving towards the car park where the altercation with police began, he added.\n\nHe said both men were compliant before the officer stamped on his head and the mother believed her son was dying as he was 'limp'. They claim the mother was then hurt.\n\nA photo showing bruising on the woman's mother's face was shown. Mr Anwar said the family wanted to 'set the record straight' and provide context about what took place at Manchester Airport. He previously said they had already spoken with the police watchdog IOPC, with a view to calling for an investigation into the officers involved.\n\nThe police constable in the video has been told he was under criminal investigation for assault, the IOPC has confirmed. Greater Manchester Police have been approached for comment.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aamer_Anwar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aamer Anwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Hotel,_Manchester", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midland Hotel, Manchester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/manchester_evening_news_792/983d9313d7714c510ceeb1170a4372fe", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794561", "eventUri": "eng-9794561", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 484, "textEnd": 491}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Taser' during Manchester Airport incident, says solicitor", "body": "Shameem Akhtar was allegedly injured in an incident at the airport in which her sons, Fahir Amaaz, and Muhammad Amaad, struggled with police.\n\nA 56-year-old grandmother was allegedly struck in the face with a Taser by a police officer at Manchester Airport moments after he kicked and attempted to stamp on her son as he lay motionless face-down, according to the family's lawyer.\n\nProtests erupted in Rochdale and Manchester city centre after a video circulated on social media showed the kicking incident during an arrest at the airport on July 23.\n\nMore footage, obtained by the Manchester Evening News, emerged days later which showed the immediate lead-up to the disturbance at the airport's Terminal 2 car park pay station area.\n\nMale and female officers tried to restrain Fahir Amaaz, 19; and Muhammad Amaad, 25; who were involved in a series of strikes and punches - with two women officers hit to the ground - before Mr Amaaz was tasered.\n\nMr Anwar said the family from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, had been been left \"devastated and traumatised\" by the incident and had also been subjected to \"horrific, racist and Islamophobic abuse on social media\".\n\nBut he added: \"The family wish to put on record that if the two young men sat next to me, and seen on video ... stand accused of criminality, their family fully support that they must face robust, due legal process.\n\n\"The young men sat next to me do not have a single criminal conviction, not even a speeding ticket.\n\nAt the press conference, photographs were distributed which showed bruising to the left side of Mrs Akhtar's face - said to have been sustained in what the family described as the \"pandemonium\" that broke out at the pay station.\n\nMrs Akhtar attempted to pull her son's head away after the apparent stamping and thought the officer \"could have killed her son at that point\", said Mr Anwar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"The male it is alleged as seen in the video then kneels down on Fahir placing his knee on his back whilst he is still limp and he then looks up straight at Mrs Akhtar.\n\nShe said Mrs Akhtar later touched her face and noticed she was bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye and that she was \"dazed, crying and disorientated\".\n\nMr Anwar said no officer attended to her injuries as she and her crying, \"distressed\", six-year-old grandson were left with luggage strewn everywhere.\n\nHe said she was finally helped by a passer-by and taken home.\n\nA police officer was suspended by GMP in the wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nMr Amaaz and Mr Amaad were among four men who were arrested on suspicion of affray and assault before they were later bailed.\n\nMr Anwar said he is seeking a further meeting with IOPC regional director Catherine Bates over lodging a formal complaint against GMP officers, and also a meeting with the mayor.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [],

Internewscast Journal", "body": "The family of a man kicked and stamped on by police at Manchester Airport today revealed details of a 'racist tirade' which they said sparked violent scenes.\n\nBrothers Fahir Amaaz, 19, and Muhammad Amaad, 25, are alleged to have sprung to their mother Shameem Akhtar's defence after she claimed that she was subjected to an hours-long barrage during a flight from Pakistan to the UK last month.\n\nMrs Akhtar, 56, said she feared she would be physically attacked by the 6ft passenger, a Kuwaiti national, after Qatar Airways cabin crew allegedly did nothing to stop him - even when he reportedly used a racial slur against her.\n\nMrs Akhtar broke down as she was greeted by her sons at the arrivals gate, who challenged the passenger, leading to unsavoury scenes captured on camera which sent shockwaves around the world.\n\nAamer Anwar, the family's solicitor, today said that there had been a deliberate attempt to smear the brothers.\n\nMr Anwar claimed police leaked information in an attempt to discredit the brothers and influence an investigation by the police watchdog into what happened.\n\nAt a press conference, Mr Anwar said: 'The deliberate attempt by some within Greater Manchester Police or so-called police sources to present a version of events to the media in the immediate aftermath and then to claim publicly that they have cooperated with the IOPC investigation is deeply unhelpful and can be seen as nothing more than a deliberate and cynical attempt to manipulate and mould a narrative of events and untruths.'\n\nMr Anwar, a high-profile Scottish human rights lawyer, said: 'Despite the attempt by some to place disinformation in the media, and on social media, the young men sat next to me do not have a single conviction or indeed a speeding ticket.'\n\nHe added: 'Today is about setting the record straight and issuing a warning to Greater Manchester Police, that leaking or using so-called police sources to justify alleged criminality by their officers can only be seen as a deliberate attempt to interfere with the IOPC investigation.'\n\nHe said the family had been subject to abuse online since the incident, but appealed for members of the community to exercise calm and not to cause police resources to be diverted at a time when race-hate riots are going on across the country linked to the Southport stabbings.\n\nMr Anwar said it was important to provide 'context' about the incident.\n\nSetting out the events of July 23, he said one of the brothers - one of whom he revealed had previously applied to join Greater Manchester Police - had confronted the alleged abuser after spotting him at a Starbucks concession.\n\nMinutes later, the brothers were arrested by armed police as they paid for parking, with Fahir unleashing a flurry of blows at two female officers in scenes captured on leaked CCTV.\n\nShortly afterwards, the male officer - who has since been suspended pending an investigation by the police watchdog - was filmed by onlookers' mobile phones kicking the younger brother in the head as he lay on the floor having been Tasered.\n\nSpeaking flanked by the brothers and their mother in their first public appearance at a central Manchester hotel today, Mr Anwar claimed the male officer had threatened to kill Fahir.\n\nAnd he demanded to know why the officers allegedly did not have their bodycams switched on during the violent altercation.\n\nMr Anwar also claimed the scenes contrasted to the way officers faced with 'grotesque' attacks from rioting anti-immigration protesters in recent days had not 'taken the law into their own hands'.\n\nHe said he was holding the press conference in response to a 'deliberate attempt to smear the family and portray incomplete version of events', including by police sources since the arrest footage went viral.\n\nSpelling out for the first time the alleged abuse suffered by Mrs Akhtar which 'sparked' what followed, Mr Anwar claimed police had decided there was insufficient evidence to charge the passenger with any offence - and that the suspect was due to fly home to Kuwait today.\n\nMr Anwar said Mrs Akhtar began to feel ill on the flight and so started using a vacant seat next to her on the flight to get comfortable.\n\nThe passenger behind her then subjected her to 'a tirade of alleged racial abuse', including a racial slur.\n\nCabin crew did nothing, Mr Anwar said, and the passenger continued with his offensive language despite requests from his wife to stop.\n\nThe row escalated at baggage return, Mr Anwar said, when the passenger used his luggage to bump into her.\n\nShe broke down in tears when she saw her sons at the arrivals gate, and explained that cabin crew failed to intervene.\n\nThe brothers challenged the passenger, and then left the airport terminal, Mr Anwar said.\n\nThe press conference heard three police officers then approached and one grabbed Fahir by the wrist, and allegedly hit his head into a ticket machine with a hand around his neck.\n\nThe family said the officer refused to remove his neckhold, then punched Amaad twice in the head and struck the brothers' mother.\n\nMrs Akhtar is then alleged to have shouted 'They killed my son' in Urdu after she noticed the older brother had been Tasered.\n\nFahir was also Tasered.\n\nMr Anwar disputed claims Fahir reached for a police firearm while prone on the ground.\n\nHe said: 'It is at this point, as the officer stands up, he proceeds to run and kick Fahir in the face.\n\n'Mrs Akhtar then tried to pull her son's head away, and the officer then attempts to stand on his head, as can be seen in the graphic video. Both brothers are compliant... The officer then proceeds to lift his foot up and appears to stamp down on Fahir's head.'\n\nAfter Fahir was Tasered and lying limp on the floor, the male officer allegedly 'strikes Mrs Akhtar directly in the face using his Taser as a weapon', Mr Anwar said, causing cuts from which bruises remain visible today.\n\nMr Anwar said the brothers claim that after they were handcuffed and taken away, the male officer told Fahir 'you dirty f****** c*** - you think you can hit my officers, I am going to kill you when I see you, in my uniform or out'.\n\nHe said Fahir asked 'why is your body camera not on' to which the officer allegedly retorted 'I'll show you why' and grabbed him by the neck and handcuffs.\n\nThe constable then allegedly dragged Fahir out of sight and threw him to the ground, placed his knee on the back of his neck and asked 'Do you want my camera on now you dirty c***?'\n\n'At this point fearing for his life all Fahir claims he is thinking is that he is going to kill him,' Mr Anwar said.\n\n'He stays quiet and doesn't say a word.'\n\nThe brothers were arrested on suspicion of affray and assaulting an emergency worker before being bailed.\n\nNeither they nor their mother addressed reporters today.\n\nMr Anwar has now said the family are calling for all footage and material relating to the incident to be retained, 'especially those where the detainees were taken to in other areas of the airport'.\n\nMr Anwar said: 'The family wish to put on record that if the two young men sat next to me and seen on video and stand accused of criminality, their family fully support that they must face robust legal due process.'\n\nHe said police must 'be held to account' if they get it wrong, but said officers should be praised for facing 'right-wing, racist thugs' spreading disorder across Britain.\n\nAnd he said the family 'fully support that they (the brothers) must face robust due legal process' if accused of any criminal behaviour.\n\nHe has said there are issues 'on both sides' over the violent scenes, stressing that the footage so far made public did not show 'the whole picture'.\n\nA GMP spokesman said: 'Investigations into incidents that occurred at Manchester Airport on 23 July are ongoing, we are fully cooperating with the independent investigation reviewing police conduct, whilst actively pursuing lines of enquiry into three incidents.\n\n'We have obtained all relevant CCTV footage and are continuing to appeal for witnesses.'\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact police.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news",

And Mr Amaad himself has undergone an interview process to join the GMP.\"\n\nAt the press conference, photographs were distributed which showed bruising to the left side of Mrs Akhtar's face - said to have been sustained in what the family described as the \"pandemonium\" that broke out at the pay station.\n\nMrs Akhtar attempted to pull her son's head away after the apparent stamping and thought the officer \"could have killed her son at that point\", said Mr Anwar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"The male it is alleged as seen in the video then kneels down on Fahir placing his knee on his back whilst he is still limp and he then looks up straight at Mrs Akhtar.\n\n\"At this point, the male officer still has his Taser drawn, then using his right hand in which he has his Taser it is alleged he strikes Mrs Akhtar directly in the face using his Taser as a weapon. At this point Mrs Akhtar screamed and held her face as she was terrified that she would now be subjected to the same violence as she alleges her sons were.\"\n\nShe said Mrs Akhtar later touched her face and noticed she was bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye and that she was \"dazed, crying and disorientated\".\n\nMr Anwar said no officer attended to her injuries as she and her crying, \"distressed\", six-year-old grandson were left with luggage strewn everywhere.\n\nHe said she was finally helped by a passer-by and taken home.\n\nA police officer was suspended by GMP in the wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nMr Amaaz and Mr Amaad were among four men who were arrested on suspicion of affray and assault before they were later bailed.\n\nMr Anwar said he is seeking a further meeting with IOPC regional director Catherine Bates over lodging a formal complaint against GMP officers, and also a meeting with the mayor.\n\nThe solicitor added: \"The family also wish to state that they know more than many other families that the police play a crucial role in our society and police with the consent of the people and that it is precisely why when they get it so badly wrong that they must be held to account.\n\n\"Equally when they get it right the police should be praised and the family wish to place on record their thanks to the police who for days have had to face right-wing racist thugs causing violent disorder and spreading fear across England.\"\n\nBut Mr Anwar added: \"In our democracy, we have the right to expect that those in uniform will not act as thugs and will act within the law and that any force used must be reasonable, legitimate and proportionate.\"\n\nOutlining what he said \"sparked\" the incident, Mr Anwar said Mrs Akhtar was earlier subjected to a \"tirade of alleged racist abuse\" from a fellow passenger, a male Kuwaiti national, on a Qatar Airways flight as she returned from a holiday in Pakistan.\n\nHe said: \"She was feeling unwell on the plane and as a result used the empty seat next to her to be able to sit more comfortable. Shortly after making use of the seat, she could hear a male muttering in the row behind her. At first, she paid no attention but then the male went out of his way over the course of the next several hours to subject her to a tirade of alleged racist abuse.\n\n\"He repeatedly called her a \"bitch\" and referring to her as a \"P*** bitch\". Mrs Akhtar for several hours of the flight was scared the male was going to become physical and assault her. Despite her appeals to the cabin crew they did nothing to intervene.\n\n\"She appealed to the the male to calm down but he refused to listen despite telling him she was unwell. He was towering over her and hurling abuse. It was a mixture of abuse in English and Arabic.\n\n\"The male's wife intervened and told him to stop and asked him to sit down; however, the male continued and his children were ridiculing Mrs Akhtar.\"\n\nShe claimed the male later used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her as she headed towards the baggage claim area.\n\nMrs Akhtar saw her two sons and grandchild when she exited arrivals and \"broke down into tears\", said Mr Anwar, and recounted her ordeal.\n\nShe later noticed the male passenger as they walked past Terminal 2's Starbucks cafe.\n\nMr Anwar said: \"Both her sons approached the male and questioned him regarding the abuse. The male was rude and proceeded to laugh in her sons' faces. An altercation then took place.\"\n\nThe family then headed towards the car park area.\n\nMr Anwar said he had previously raised concerns at GMP's \"failure\" to investigate an alleged hate crime against Mrs Akhtar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"GMP confirmed a few days ago that following investigation they believed there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.\n\n\"The individual who was a Kuwaiti national will be allowed to return home today.\n\n\"Mrs Akhtar feels betrayed and once again let down by the failure of GMP to act.\"\n\nGMP has appealed for any witnesses to the altercation on Qatar Airways flight QR023, which arrived at 7.20pm, the second \"violent\" altercation at Starbucks at 8.22pm and the incident at the car park paypoint area at 8.28pm.",

It came after a man appeared to be kicked and stamped on as he lay on the ground. Footage went viral from inside Terminal 2 showing one of the men being kicked in the head during the incident on July 23.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News later published a second clip, which shed more light on the moments before. The video showed the two men throwing punches at a male officer near a ticket machine inside one of the airport's car parks.\n\nREAD MORE: More suspects appear in court over disorder in Greater Manchester - latest updates\n\nThis morning the family appeared alongside their lawyer Mr Anwar. Addressing the media at the Midland Hotel, he detailed their version of events.\n\nMr Anwer alleged that the woman had been racially abused on a Qatari Airlines flight back from Pakistan. He said a man sitting in the row behind her had subjected her to a 'tirade of alleged racist abuse' and called her a 'P*** b****'.\n\nShe was feeling extremely unwell and tried to move away from the man who she said was intimidating her. She asked the man to calm down but he continued to abuse and 'bully' her for several hours, Mr Anwer alleged.\n\nWhen she left the aircraft, Mr Anwer alleged the man 'used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her'. She was upset and collected the wrong luggage at the carousel, only realising when she got home.\n\nThe press conference was told the woman met her sons, who went to pick her up along with her grandson and explained what had happened on board. They say her sons had spotted the man she said had racially abused her. They spoke to the man before leaving towards the car park where the altercation with police began, he added.\n\nHe said both men were compliant before the officer stamped on his head and the mother believed her son was dying as he was 'limp'. They claim the mother was then hurt.\n\nA photo showing bruising on the woman's mother's face was shown to the press conference. Mr Anwar said the family wanted to 'set the record straight' and provide context about what took place at Manchester Airport.

His brother Muhammad Amaad, 25, was also arrested during the incident.\n\nThe video led to an angry response, with around 200 protesters gathering outside Rochdale Police Station, some shouting \"GMP shame on you!\"\n\nLast month, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) confirmed an officer had been advised he was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nA decision will then be made on whether to refer the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service and whether the officer involved should face disciplinary proceedings.\n\nFurther footage allegedly showing the moments before Mr Amaaz's arrest near a ticket machine at Manchester Airport was later released.\n\nGMP said at the time it was responding to reports of an assault.\n\nWhat allegedly happened on the Qatar Airways flight?\n\nMr Anwar claimed the alleged cause of the incident occurred when Ms Akhtar started to feel ill when travelling back from Pakistan on a Qatar Airways flight. The solicitor said after she used an empty seat to make herself more comfortable, she could hear \"a male muttering in the row behind her\".\n\n\"The male then went out of his way over the next few hours to subject her to a tirade of alleged racial abuse,\" Mr Anwar claimed, adding that the male also allegedly used his hand luggage to hit Ms Akhtar's hand luggage once they had left the plane.\n\nHe added: \"As soon as she [Ms Akhtar] exited at the arrivals, she saw her two sons and six-year-old grandson waiting for her, she broke down in tears and told what had happened to her over the last several hours.\"\n\nMr Anwar continued to say that when exiting the terminal, Ms Akhtar recognised the male passenger at a Starbucks and \"froze\". Both sons \"approached the male and questioned him regarding the abuse... and an altercation took place\".\n\nThe family then left and headed towards the airport car park, where Mr Amaaz was approached by three officers, the solicitor said.\n\nMr Anwar said on 30 July, Ms Akhtar was offered an interview by GMP after his office raised concerns they had failed to investigate the alleged hate crime against her.\n\nHe was told a few days later by the force that after an investigation, there was \"insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction\" and the male passenger in question was allowed to return to Qatar.\n\nMr Anwar added that the \"leaked footage\" of the incident that occurred next \"was released by GMP to justify alleged criminality by their officers\". He claimed the release of the footage can only be seen as a \"deliberate attempt to interfere with the IOPC investigation\".\n\nHe said the \"footage does not show exactly what the police did, how the incident began or the full conduct of officers in the aftermath of the incident, including after the arrest\".\n\nAddressing comments made by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, in which he said he had viewed all the available CCTV footage and said there were \"issues on both sides,\" Mr Anwar said the family should have been the first to have been given the opportunity to view the footage.\n\nRequesting for all available footage to be retained, he also said the family are seeking to meet with Mr Burnham and intend to meet with the director of the IOPC to speak about launching a formal complaint against officers within GMP.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said in response to the allegations set out in the news conference that its investigations into the incidents at Manchester Airport are ongoing.\n\nIt said it is \"fully cooperating with the independent investigation reviewing police conduct, whilst actively pursuing lines of inquiry into three incidents\".\n\nThe first incident is believed to be the alleged altercation between passengers from a Qatar Airways flight, the second the alleged altercation involving members of the public in Starbucks and the third the alleged assault of three police officers - including a female constable who received a broken nose.\n\n\"We have obtained all relevant CCTV footage and are continuing to appeal for witnesses,\" the force said.\n\nCalling for calm within the community, Mr Anwar said the family are launching a public appeal for individuals to remain calm and will not tolerate further demonstrations outside police stations.\n\nRead more:\n\nManchester Airport officer will have to justify his actions\n\nCriminal investigation into officer over airport incident\n\n\"Police have had enough to deal with,\" he said,

Airport family victims of 'smear campaign'", "body": "TOP Scots lawyer Aamer Anwar who is representing the family at the centre of the Manchester Airport police video claims they are the victims of a \"smear campaign\".\n\nThe new family lawyer for Fahir Amaaz, 19, accused police of deliberately leaking footage of an airport brawl to discredit his family and \"justify\" the stamp which triggered mass protests last month.\n\nViral footage from July 23 showed an armed officer kicking the youngster's head while he lay on the floor in handcuffs.\n\nBut subsequent video from just moments before showed how he and his brother, Muhammed Amaad, 25, had seemingly attacked the male officer and two female colleagues, leaving one with a broken nose.\n\nAt a press conference yesterday, held against a backdrop of tinderbox race tensions across the UK, solicitor Mr Anwar said the pair had been defending their mother Shameem, 56, from racist abuse.\n\nMrs Akhtar, who jetted to Britain from Pakistan, feared a 6ft passenger would physically attack her after a Qatar Airways cabin crew did nothing to stop him using slurs.\n\nThe woman is said to have broken down in tears as her sons greeted her at the arrivals gate before both men stormed off to confront the alleged racist.\n\nAfter police intervened in the conflict, the brothers fought with cops for up to an hour in three separate brawls before Fahir was eventually tasered.\n\nMr Anwar said he had lodged a formal complaint with the IOPC but felt compelled to speak publicly as cops were making a \"deliberate attempt to smear\" the family with an \"incomplete\" story.\n\nThe family - which includes serving police officers - also made further claims of racial abuse against a cop who allegedly turned his body camera off to further beat Fahir.\n\nThe unnamed cop is also said to have called Amaad a \"dirty f****** c***\".\n\nWhen asked why his camera was off, the cop supposedly replied, \"I'll show you why\", before Fahir was dragged away around the corner out of view and thrown face down to the ground.\n\nPlacing a knee over his neck, it's alleged the officer added: \"Do you want my camera on now you dirty c***?\"\n\nMr Anwar said Fahir was left \"fearing for his life\", and there was further verbal abuse that wasn't caught on camera.\n\nHe also claimed that during the melee an officer struck Mrs Akhtar leaving her with facial bruising below her left eye.\n\nThe lawyer went on: \"There is never any legal justification for the use of excessive, disproportionate and potentially lethal force.\n\n\"The repeated attempts by so-called 'police sources' to spin a false narrative or partial context, is deeply unhelpful to an IOPC investigation.\n\n\"Leaked footage does not show exactly what the police did, how the incident unfolded, nor the full conduct of officers in the aftermath of the incident in all parts of the airport, including after the arrests.\"\n\nHe added the selective release of footage had contributed to a \"campaign of disinformation in an attempt to justify police violence\".\n\nMr Anwar said he would be seeking a meeting with Manchester mayor Andy Burnham over why he was shown the CCTV that was later leaked.\n\nAfter watching the video, Mr Burnham urged the public to wait for the full story.\n\nHundreds of protesters hurled missiles at Rochdale police station last month in the wake of the video being viewed millions of times around the world.\n\nMr Anwar insisted the family did not endorse any violent response and wanted to deal with the incident peacefully.\n\nGreater Manchester Police was asked to respond to the fresh allegations.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And Mr Amaad himself has undergone an interview process to join the GMP.\"\n\nAt the press conference, photographs were distributed which showed bruising to the left side of Mrs Akhtar's face - said to have been sustained in what the family described as the \"pandemonium\" that broke out at the pay station.\n\nMrs Akhtar attempted to pull her son's head away after the apparent stamping and thought the officer \"could have killed her son at that point\", said Mr Anwar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"The male it is alleged as seen in the video then kneels down on Fahir placing his knee on his back whilst he is still limp and he then looks up straight at Mrs Akhtar.\n\n\"At this point, the male officer still has his Taser drawn, then using his right hand in which he has his Taser it is alleged he strikes Mrs Akhtar directly in the face using his Taser as a weapon. At this point Mrs Akhtar screamed and held her face as she was terrified that she would now be subjected to the same violence as she alleges her sons were.\"\n\nShe said Mrs Akhtar later touched her face and noticed she was bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye and that she was \"dazed, crying and disorientated\".\n\nMr Anwar said no officer attended to her injuries as she and her crying, \"distressed\", six-year-old grandson were left with luggage strewn everywhere.\n\nHe said she was finally helped by a passer-by and taken home.\n\nA police officer was suspended by GMP in the wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nMr Amaaz and Mr Amaad were among four men who were arrested on suspicion of affray and assault before they were later bailed.\n\nMr Anwar said he is seeking a further meeting with IOPC regional director Catherine Bates over lodging a formal complaint against GMP officers, and also a meeting with the mayor.", "source": {"uri": "chelmsfordweeklynews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chelmsford Times"},

Mr Anwar said the family has already spoken with the Independent Office for Police Conduct earlier this week, while providing details on what allegedly happened before the events shown in the video.\n\nSpeaking at the conference, Mr Anwar explained what the family claims happened on the Qatar Airways plane before it landed at the airport in late July. He claimed Ms Akhtar was subject to racist abuse aboard the flight, with one person calling her a \"p**i\".\n\nHe added that she was apparently feeling extremely unwell and tried to move away from the man she alleged had hurled the abuse. The lawyer went on to claim the mum told her two sons what had happened, and that they spotted the man who had allegedly abused her. They spoke to the man and then left, walking towards the car park, where the altercation with police took place.\n\nThe family lawyer claimed the mum shouted \"they have killed my son\" as she saw him tasered, believing he had died as he went \"limp\". The family has been \"traumatised\" by the incident, an MP has said, after brutal footage showed the moment a Greater Manchester Police officer kicked a man in the head while he lay on the floor of Manchester Airport's terminal two. Police have since suspended the officer and launched an internal investigation into the incident.\n\nRochdale MP Paul Waugh said the \"hard working\" Rochdale locals were \"particularly shocked\" by the violence. He said: \"It is clear they [the family] are deeply traumatised by what happened.\" He added: \"This is a hardworking Rochdale family, some of whose members are police officers themselves, and are therefore particularly shocked at what they have witnessed.\n\n\"The family also want me to make it crystal clear that they have no political agenda, do not condone political violence and do not want to take part in any protests. They wanted me to appeal for calm and I hope that appeal is heeded. While there is clearly deep concern about this incident, there is also a vital need not to let extremists of any kind hijack these events for their own ends.\"\n\nThe Mirror has contacted Greater Manchester Police for comment.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_doyle@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Liam Doyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Office_for_Police_Conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent Office for Police Conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rochdale"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rochdale"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33404184.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brothers-In-Manchester-Airport-Incident-Hold-Press-Conference-With-Solicitor.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794561", "eventUri": "eng-9794561", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

has been a deliberate attempt to smear them.\n\nFahir Amaaz, 19, was allegedly attacked while he was arrested alongside his brother Muhammad Amaad, 25.\n\nProtests erupted in Rochdale and Manchester city centre after a video circulated of a police officer allegedly kicking and stamping on Muhammed Fahir, 19, as he lay face-down during an arrest at the airport on July 23.\n\nHis brother Amaad, 25, was also arrested.\n\nSolicitor Aamer Anwar, second from right, accompanies brothers Muhammad Amaad (left), Fahir Amaaz (right) and their mother, Shameem Akhtar\n\nMs Akhtar was left with a cut and bruising to her face after allegedly being struck by an officer\n\nA Greater Manchester Police constable was advised he is under criminal investigation for assault over the incident, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\n\nHowever, CCTV released after the initial video showed Fahir attacking three officers just seconds before he was kicked on the ground.\n\nBut their solicitor Aamer Anwar claimed police leaked information in an attempt to discredit the brothers and influence an investigation by the police watchdog into what happened.\n\nIn a press conference, Mr Anwar said: 'The deliberate attempt by some within Greater Manchester Police or so-called police sources to present a version of events to the media in the immediate aftermath and then to claim publicly that they have cooperated with the IOPC investigation is deeply unhelpful and can be seen as nothing more than a deliberate and cynical attempt to manipulate and mould a narrative of events and untruths.'\n\nHe said the family, including the brothers' mother Shameem Akhtar, who had arrived at the airport on a flight from Pakistan in which she was allegedly racially abused by a passenger, were 'left devastated and traumatised by the incident'.\n\nHe alleged Ms Akhtar was left with a cut and bruising to her face after being struck by an officer, and claimed Fahir was called a 'dirty f****** c***' by a member of the arresting team.\n\nMs Akhtar, 56, appears tearful as she faces the media\n\nFootage of a police officer kicking Muhammed Fahir, 19, while he was arrested alongside his brother Amaad\n\nMr Anwar, a high-profile Scottish human rights lawyer, said: 'Despite the attempt by some to place disinformation in the media, and on social media, the young men sat next to me do not have a single conviction or indeed a speeding ticket.'\n\nHe added: 'Today is about setting the record straight and issuing a warning to Greater Manchester Police, that leaking or using so-called police sources to justify alleged criminality by their officers can only be seen as a deliberate attempt to interfere with the IOPC investigation.'\n\nHe said the family had been subject to abuse online since the incident, but appealed for members of the community to exercise calm and not to cause police resources to be depleted at a time when race-hate riots are going on across the country linked to the Southport stabbings.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aamer_Anwar", "type": "person",

the family of a man who was kicked and stamped on by police at an airport have made further allegations of mistreatment.\n\nMuhammad Fahir Amaaz was struck by a firearms officer at Manchester Airport after he and his brother Amaad Amaaz were arrested following a violent clash with police on 23 July.\n\nTheir solicitor Aamer Anwar has claimed Fahir Amaaz was then threatened by an officer, thrown to the ground and had his neck knelt upon in an area of the terminal without cameras.\n\nA spokesman for Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the force was \"fully cooperating\" with a police watchdog's independent investigation into the incident.\n\nThe now suspended Greater Manchester Police constable who kicked and stamped on Fahir Amaaz is facing a criminal investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct over the level of force used.\n\nFootage of the incident was shared widely online prompting protests in Rochdale and Manchester city centre.\n\nGMP had said their firearms officers were subject to a \"violent\" attack while trying to make an arrest at terminal two.\n\nA spokesman for the force said there was a risk their weapons could be taken from them.\n\nA further video later emerged showing the build up to the kicking incident involved a fight in which officers were punched to the ground.\n\nFour men were arrested for assault and affray following the incident.\n\nMr Anwar, speaking on behalf of the Rochdale family, said officers approached Fahir Amaaz without identifying themselves.\n\nIt was alleged they hit his head into the ticket machine by grabbing his neck.\n\nThe solicitor said Fahir Amaaz was thrown to the ground and knelt on by an officer, who they allege threatened to \"kill him\", after he was detained following the fight.\n\nMr Anwar claimed the officer's body-worn police camera had been turned off when this happened.\n\nMr Anwar also claimed GMP had not questioned a man who allegedly racially abused the men's mother, Shameem Akhtar, as she flew to Manchester from Doha.\n\nThis incident is alleged by the family to have caused an altercation between the man and the two brothers, which led police to be called.\n\nThe solicitor also alleges the disclosure of the second video to the Manchester Evening News showing the build-up to the kicking incident was a \"deliberate attempt to smear the family\".\n\nIt was a bid to \"portray an incomplete version of events in a bid to prejudice proceedings\", he claimed.\n\nThe GMP spokesman said police were actively \"pursing lines of enquiry into three incidents\", and had obtained \"all relevant CCTV footage\".\n\nHe repeated any appeal any witness or those with footage of the incidents to contact the police.\n\nChief Constable of GMP Stephen Watson spoke to BBC Radio Manchester about the incident before the press conference was held.\n\nHe said he was \"constrained\" by what he could say, but acknowledge an IOPC probe and a criminal investigation into a \"series of assaults\" were both ongoing.\n\n\"We live in a really complicated age, social media is really good at putting partial pictures into the public domain, and as a result people are quite swift to rush to judgement.\"\n\n\"We just need to be balanced, and wait for all the facts to emerge, because the reality is, the public still don't have the full facts.\n\n\"There's all sorts of imagery and all the rest of it that will be made available to the appropriate authorities at the appropriate time, but we don't do this in the social media space.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

He stays quiet and doesn't say a word.\"\n\nIt is understood that the officer suspended a fortnight ago is the same one referred to in the family's allegations on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe family claimed the incident began when Shameem Akhtar, their mother, was racially abused aboard a Qatar Airways flight that landed at Manchester Airport on July 23.\n\nHer two sons met her at the airport and saw the man who she claims was abusing her. Mr Anwar, the solicitor, said an \"altercation\" took place at a Starbucks cafe inside the airport terminal, but refused to give further details.\n\nAfter the altercation police came to the family as they were paying for parking prior to leaving.\n\nThe family claimed that police started the interaction by grabbing Mr Amaaz's wrist and neck before hitting his head into the ticket machine.\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nMrs Akhtar was also left bleeding during the police incident after being hit in the face with a Taser wielded by one of the officers, the family claimed.\n\nShe is also said to have tried to pull her son's head away from the officer who was kicking and stamping on it, fearing that the constable could have killed him.\n\nNo details were given at Tuesday's family press conference of the brain cyst discovered in Mr Amaaz's head and previously announced by the family's former solicitor in the aftermath of the incident.\n\nAkhmed Yakoob, who formerly represented the family, said he was \"stepping aside\" last week after claiming the media had tried to sabotage him.\n\nMr Anwar, their current solicitor, has courted controversy by previously comparing Israel and the US with the September 11 hijackers in comments he made more than a decade ago.\n\nGreater Manchester Police declined to comment and referred to previous statements it published about the incident.\n\nThose included claims that armed officers at the scene feared the brothers were trying to steal their weapons.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating the incident and has been contacted for comment.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And Mr Amaad himself has undergone an interview process to join the GMP.\"\n\nAt the press conference, photographs were distributed which showed bruising to the left side of Mrs Akhtar's face - said to have been sustained in what the family described as the \"pandemonium\" that broke out at the pay station.\n\nMrs Akhtar attempted to pull her son's head away after the apparent stamping and thought the officer \"could have killed her son at that point\", said Mr Anwar.\n\nMr Anwar went on: \"The male it is alleged as seen in the video then kneels down on Fahir placing his knee on his back whilst he is still limp and he then looks up straight at Mrs Akhtar.\n\n\"At this point, the male officer still has his Taser drawn, then using his right hand in which he has his Taser it is alleged he strikes Mrs Akhtar directly in the face using his Taser as a weapon. At this point Mrs Akhtar screamed and held her face as she was terrified that she would now be subjected to the same violence as she alleges her sons were.\"\n\nShe said Mrs Akhtar later touched her face and noticed she was bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye and that she was \"dazed, crying and disorientated\".\n\nMr Anwar said no officer attended to her injuries as she and her crying, \"distressed\", six-year-old grandson were left with luggage strewn everywhere.\n\nHe said she was finally helped by a passer-by and taken home.\n\nA police officer was suspended by GMP in the wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nMr Amaaz and Mr Amaad were among four men who were arrested on suspicion of affray and assault before they were later bailed.\n\nMr Anwar said he is seeking a further meeting with IOPC regional director Catherine Bates over lodging a formal complaint against GMP officers, and also a meeting with the mayor.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [],

morning.\n\nThe family said they have been left devastated and traumatised by the events at Manchester Airport and that they have faced horrific racist and Islamophobic abuse in the wake of the incident.\n\nThey also said there has been a campaign of disinformation in an attempt to justify the alleged police violence and that Greater Manchester Police (GMP) have failed to investigate further hate crimes against the family.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia among countries to issue UK travel advice amid far-right violence\n\nFootage from the incident last month went viral on social media as it

mother of the family had been subjected to racist abuse by another passenger when she was travelling by herself on a Qatar Airways flight.\n\nThe mother was allegedly called a \"p**i b***h\" and was concerned for her safety as the other passenger ranted at her on the airplane.\n\nThe two brothers saw the passenger later at the airport when their mum pointed them out and confronted them about the alleged racial abuse which was followed by an \"altercation\".\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nIt is claimed that the GMP officers approached the family shortly afterward where they \"immediately grabbed\" the brothers and the situation escalated despite the two men \"not resisting arrest\".\n\nThe statement said one brother was placed into a neck hold and punched in the head multiple times before being tasered as his mum shouted in Urdu \"they have killed my son\".\n\nThe family's lawyer Anwar has alleged that the police \"leaked\" information to discredit the family and to influence the investigation by an independent police watchdog.\n\nHe said: \"There has been a repeated use of the word context when the family have been given no opportunity to provide this.\n\n\"The family have been subjected to horrific racist and Islamophobic abuse on social media, and there has been a campaign of disinformation in an attempt to justify alleged police violence.\n\n\"As far as we are aware

More footage emerged days later which showed the immediate lead-up to the disturbance at the airport's Terminal 2 car park pay station area.\n\nMale and female officers tried to restrain Fahir Amaaz, 19, and Muhammad Amaad, 25, who were involved in a series of strikes and punches -- with two women officers hit to the ground -- before Amaaz was tasered.\n\nAkhtar, her sons, Amaaz and Amaad, appeared alongside their solicitor Aamer Anwar at a press conference in Manchester city centre to \"set the record straight [...] after a deliberate attempt to smear the family\".\n\nAnwar said the family from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, had been left \"devastated and traumatised\" by the incident and had also been subjected to \"horrific, racist and Islamophobic abuse on social media\".\n\nThe lawyer added: \"The family wish to put on record that if the two young men sat next to me, and seen on video [...] stand accused of criminality, their family fully support that they must face robust, due legal process.\n\n\"The young men sat next to me do not have a single criminal conviction, not even a speeding ticket. In fact, members of the family are serving police officers with Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and other members of the family in other areas of the country. And Amaad himself has undergone an interview process to join the GMP.\"\n\nAt the press conference, photographs were distributed which showed bruising to the left side of Akhtar's face -- said to have been sustained in what the family described as the \"pandemonium\" that broke out at the pay station. Akhtar attempted to pull her son's head away after the apparent stamping and thought the officer \"could have killed her son at that point\", said Anwar.\n\nHe added: \"The male, it is alleged, as seen in the video, then kneels down on Amaaz placing his knee on his back whilst he is still limp and he then looks up straight at Akhtar. At this point, the male officer still has his Taser drawn, then using his right hand in which he has his Taser it is alleged he strikes Akhtar directly in the face using his Taser as a weapon. At this point Akhtar screamed and held her face as she was terrified that she would now be subjected to the same violence as she alleges her sons were.\"\n\nHe said Akhtar later touched her face and noticed she was bleeding from her cheek underneath her left eye and that she was \"dazed, crying and disorientated\".\n\nAnwar said no officer attended to her injuries as she and her crying, \"distressed\", six-year-old grandson were left with luggage strewn everywhere. He said she was finally helped by a passer-by and taken home.\n\nA police officer was suspended by GMP in the wake of the incident and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) later said a police constable, understood to be the same officer, was under criminal investigation for assault.\n\nFollowing the release of the later footage, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, urged people to \"take a step back\" and allow the authorities to carry out their investigations.\n\nAmaaz and Amaad were among four men who were arrested on suspicion of affray and assault before they were later bailed.\n\nAnwar said he is seeking a further meeting with IOPC regional director Catherine Bates over lodging a formal complaint against GMP officers, and also a meeting with the mayor.\n\nThe solicitor added: \"The family also wish to state that they know more than many other families that the police play a crucial role in our society and police with the consent of the people and that it is precisely why when they get it so badly wrong that they must be held to account.\n\n\"Equally when they get it right the police should be praised and the family wish to place on record their thanks to the police who for days have had to face right-wing racist thugs causing violent disorder and spreading fear across England.\"\n\nBut Anwar added: \"In our democracy, we have the right to expect that those in uniform will not act as thugs and will act within the law and that any force used must be reasonable, legitimate and proportionate.\"\n\nOutlining what he said \"sparked\" the incident, Anwar said Akhtar was earlier subjected to a \"tirade of alleged racist abuse\" from a fellow passenger, a male Kuwaiti national, on a Qatar Airways flight as she returned from a holiday in Pakistan.\n\nHe said: \"She was feeling unwell on the plane and as a result used the empty seat next to her to be able to sit more comfortable. Shortly after making use of the seat, she could hear a male muttering in the row behind her. At first, she paid no attention but then the male went out of his way over the course of the next several hours to subject her to a tirade of alleged racist abuse.\n\n\"He repeatedly called her a \"b***h\" and referring to her as a \"P*** b***h\". Akhtar for several hours of the flight was scared the male was going to become physical and assault her. Despite her appeals to the cabin crew they did nothing to intervene.\n\n\"She appealed to the male to calm down but he refused to listen despite telling him she was unwell. He was towering over her and hurling abuse. It was a mixture of abuse in English and Arabic.\n\n\"The male's wife intervened and told him to stop and asked him to sit down; however, the male continued and his children were ridiculing Akhtar.\"\n\nShe claimed the male later used his hand luggage to repeatedly bump into her as she headed towards the baggage claim area.\n\nAkhtar saw her two sons and grandchild when she exited arrivals and \"broke down into tears\", said Anwar, and recounted her ordeal.\n\nShe later noticed the male passenger as they walked past Terminal 2's Starbucks cafe.\n\nAnwar said: \"Both her sons approached the male and questioned him regarding the abuse. The male was rude and proceeded to laugh in her sons' faces. An altercation then took place.\"\n\nThe family then headed towards the car park area.\n\nAnwar said he had previously raised concerns at GMP's \"failure\" to investigate an alleged hate crime against Akhtar.\n\nAnwar went on: \"GMP confirmed a few days ago that following investigation they believed there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The individual who was a Kuwaiti national will be allowed to return home today. Akhtar feels betrayed and once again let down by the failure of GMP to act.\"\n\nGMP has appealed for any witnesses to the altercation on Qatar Airways flight QR023, which arrived at 7:20pm, the second \"violent\" altercation at Starbucks at 8:22pm and the incident at the car park pay point area at 8:28pm.\n\nIn a statement, GMP said: \"Investigations into incidents that occurred at Manchester Airport on July 23 are ongoing.\n\n\"We are fully co-operating with the independent investigation reviewing police conduct, whilst actively pursuing lines of inquiry into three incidents.\n\n\"We have obtained all relevant CCTV footage and are continuing to appeal for witnesses.", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "GEO TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

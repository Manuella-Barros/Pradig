Israel swiftly dismisses Beijing declaration. There can't be a role for Hamas: US.\n\nBeijing /HONG KONG - Rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah have signed a declaration agreeing to form an interim \"national reconciliation government\" for the occupied West Bank and Gaza after the war with Israel, in a meeting brokered by China, China's foreign minister and Hamas officials said Tuesday.\n\nRepresentatives from the groups, along with 12 other Palestinian factions, pledged to work for unity after three days of talks in Beijing.\n\nIt is the latest of several reconciliation deals Hamas and Fatah have agreed on in their long fractured relationship, none of which have yet led to the end of the schism.\n\nIsrael has also ruled out a role for Hamas or Fatah in governing Gaza after the end of hostilities there.\n\nThe deep split began in 2007 when Hamas became the sole ruler in Gaza after violently ejecting Fatah from the territory. This came after Palestinian President and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas dissolved the Hamas-led unity government formed when Hamas won national elections the year before.\n\nSince then, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority has been left in charge of only parts of the West Bank. Hamas has lost control in Gaza since the war with Israel began on 7 October with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel, in which it killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of the Israeli offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nIn a statement posted on Telegram, Hamas spokesman Hossam Badran said the declaration was an \"additional positive step on the path to achieving Palestinian national unity\".\n\nHe said the groups were in agreement on \"Palestinian demands relating to ending the war... which are: a ceasefire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, relief and reconstruction.\"\n\nHe said \"the most important\" part of what was agreed was to form a Palestinian national consensus government \"that would manage the affairs of our people in Gaza and the West Bank, supervise reconstruction, and prepare the conditions for elections\".\n\nThe declaration is in effect an expression of intent as there are major obstacles to making such an agreement work. Fatah has yet to comment on it, though its representative Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its support of the Palestinian cause following the announcement.\n\nIsrael, which has vowed to destroy Hamas before it will end the war, swiftly dismissed the Beijing declaration. \"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,\" Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nThe announcement followed reconciliation talks hosted by China involving 14 Palestinian factions starting Sunday, according to China's Foreign Ministry, which come as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and as Beijing has sought to present itself as a potential peace broker in the conflict.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the agreement was \"dedicated to the great reconciliation and unity of all 14 factions.\" \"The core outcome is that the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people,\" Wang said, adding that \"an agreement has been reached on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government.\"\n\nFatah dominates both the PLO and the PA, the interim Palestinian government that was established in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after the 1993 agreement known as the Oslo Accords was signed. Hamas was not party to the accords and does not recognize Israel.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative, who was at the Beijing talks, said \"all the parties\" have agreed that they should join the PLO, and that the organization is the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians.\n\nThere is a long history of bitter enmity between Hamas and Fatah. The two sides have tried - and failed - multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure, with a 2017 agreement quickly folding in violence.\n\nThe PA held administrative control over Gaza until 2007, after Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and expelled it from the strip. Since then, Hamas has ruled Gaza and the PA governs parts of the West Bank.\n\nBarghouti said the latest attempt at reconciling the Palestinian factions \"went much further\" than previous efforts and included \"specific steps\" towards the formation of a consensus government. The war in Gaza, he told CNN, has prodded the factions to unite as a common front against Israel's occupation.\n\n\"There was a very clear feeling that what Israel is doing is really threatening everybody,\" he said. \"And so, in that sense, the feeling of unity (to) confront the Israeli side is very clear here.\"\n\nA new government would ensure the unity of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, ruling both territories after the war and effectively \"blocking Israeli efforts\" to maintain its occupation of Gaza, he said.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday in Beijing, Hamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook said they had reached an agreement to complete a \"course of reconciliation,\" while also using the platform in Beijing to defend the group's October 7 attack on Israel. \"We're at a historic junction. Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,\" Abu Marzook said, according to a translation provided by China's Foreign Ministry, adding that the October 7 operation had \"changed a lot, both in international and regional landscape.\"\n\nBeijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nChina's role\n\nTuesday's agreement follows an earlier round of talks between Hamas and Fatah hosted by Beijing in April.\n\nSince the start of the war in Gaza, China - which has looked to bolster its influence and ties in the Middle East in recent years - has presented itself as a leading voice for countries across the Global South decrying Israel's war in the enclave and calling for Palestinian statehood.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping in May called for an international peace conference during meetings with leaders from Arab nations and has also dispatched a special envoy to the Middle East to meet with diplomats and officials.\n\nThe US State Department said that while it had not reviewed the text of the Beijing agreement, it did not support Hamas having a role in the postwar governance of Gaza. \"When it comes to governance of Gaza at the end of the conflict, there can't be a role for a terrorist organization,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a press briefing, referring to Hamas specifically.\n\nMiller said he did not believe the deal would \"in any way have an impact on the ongoing discussions to reach a ceasefire.\" Miller also said the US wants to see the Palestinian Authority governing \"a unified Gaza and the West Bank\" after the war.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

The U.S. and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel -- a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\" The agreement offered only broad outlines for how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war. The unity efforts are motivated in part by Palestinians' desire to offer a scenario for postwar rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it vowed to destroy after the militants' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ' Fatah has been deeply reluctant to share power with its longtime rival. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and that it advocates for forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions. That government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, \"We made clear we want to see the Palestinian Authority\" with a governing role in Gaza, \"but no, we do not want to see a role for Hamas,\" which he said has \"blood on its hands.\"\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions including Hamas said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognize Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognized Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s. Those deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving the authority in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves. Many Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organization, including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority. Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement after the talks saying it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it demanded the withdrawal of the PLO's recognition of Israel.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage

The U.S. and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel -- a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\" The agreement offered only broad outlines for how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war. The unity efforts are motivated in part by Palestinians' desire to offer a scenario for postwar rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it vowed to destroy after the militants' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah has been deeply reluctant to share power with its longtime rival. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and that it advocates for forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions.

The groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded blame.\n\nThe long-feuding Palestinian factions have previously failed to heal their political disputes after Hamas fighters expelled Fatah from Gaza in a short war in 2007.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.",

The U.S. and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel -- a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\" The agreement offered only broad outlines for how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war. The unity efforts are in part motivated by Palestinians' desire to offer a potential vision for postwar rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it vowed to destroy after the militants' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah has been deeply reluctant to share power with its longtime rival. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and that it advocates for forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions. That government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions including Hamas said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognize Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognized Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s. Those deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving the authority in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves. Many Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organization, including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nSullivan: Hamas cease-fire response has both 'understandable' and 'out of step' proposals\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority. Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement after the talks saying it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it demanded the withdrawal of the PLO's recognition of Israel.\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

The Beijing Declaration has yet to be tested on the ground.The agreement displays China's growing influence in the Middle East. Last year, it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nPalestinian factions including rivals Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their divisions and form an interim national unity government during negotiations in China that ended on Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout.\n\nPrevious efforts by Egypt and other Arab countries to reconcile Hamas and Fatah have failed to end 17 years of power-sharing conflict that have weakened Palestinian political aspirations, and it remains to be seen whether this deal will survive the realities on the ground.\n\nNETANYAHU'S MEETING AT WHITE HOUSE MOVED AMID BIDEN'S COVID RECOVERY, HARRIS CAMPAIGNING\n\nThe meeting was held amid attempts by international mediators to reach a ceasefire deal for Gaza, with one of the sticking points being the \"day-after\" plan - how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war that began on Oct. 7 ends.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the most important point of the Beijing Declaration was to form a Palestinian national unity government to manage the affairs of Palestinians.\n\n\"This creates a formidable barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests in managing Palestinian affairs post-war,\" Badran said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy the Iran-backed Hamas group and opposes it having any role in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, (Fatah leader) Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\nBadran said the national unity government would manage the affairs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nCurrently, Hamas runs Gaza and Fatah forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. There has been no immediate comment from Fatah.\n\nDetails of the agreement did not set out a timeframe for forming a new government. In March, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, appointed a new government led by one of his close aides, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happen without U.S. approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\n\"What happened in China was nothing but a meeting, a celebratory event, but it is impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days,\" said Abouelhoul, managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram.\n\nISRAEL STRIKES IRAN-BACKED HOUTHIS AFTER TEHRAN PROXY ATTACKED JEWISH STATE: 'SIGNIFICANCE IS CLEAR'\n\nNonetheless, the agreement marks a diplomatic coup for Beijing and its growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during the closing ceremony, according to the readout.\n\n\"China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\"\n\nThe most \"prominent highlight\" was the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, Wang said, adding that the international community should support efforts to form an interim Palestinian government to control Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad are not members of the PLO, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, but they demand that any unity deal includes holding an election for the PLO parliament to secure their inclusion. The Islamist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded blame.\n\nThe long-feuding Palestinian factions have previously failed to heal their political disputes after Hamas fighters expelled Fatah from Gaza in a short war in 2007.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians",

It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nThe two groups signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" according to state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, swiftly rejected the agreement yesterday, stating that no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe agreement also underscores China's growing role in Middle East diplomacy, with success in the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"But to be sure, China is still the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" According to the joint statement, the two groups are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nThe deal does not appear to bridge the two group's diverging position on Israel. Hamas previously said it would accept a state based on 1967 borders, while also refusing to officially recognize Israel. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, abides by interim peace agreements with Israel signed in the early 1990s.\n\nThe agreement signed by the Palestinian factions promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in both 2011 and 2022.\n\n\"The understanding in China is based on widening the scope of the membership on the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) to include other factions who have not joined it\" including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian. Hamas members have never been part of PLO, the Palestinian government body responsible for international affairs. In a statement, Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, praised the agreement, describing it as a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nBut yesterday's deal doesn't have a hard timeline.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nRepeated attempts at mending the rift have failed, wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.", "source": {"uri": "macaudailytimes.com.mo", "dataType": "news", "title": "Macau Daily Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The US and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel -- a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\" The agreement offered only broad outlines for how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war. The unity efforts are motivated in part by Palestinians' desire to offer a scenario for postwar rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it vowed to destroy after the militants' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected US calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah has been deeply reluctant to share power with its longtime rival. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and that it advocates for forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions. That government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed.\"\n\nUS State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, \"We made clear we want to see the Palestinian Authority\" with a governing role in Gaza, \"but no, we do not want to see a role for Hamas,\" which he said has \"blood on its hands.\"\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas, and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions including Hamas said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognize Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognized Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s. Those deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving the authority in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves. Many Palestinians view the authority as corrupt and out of touch and as a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organization, including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority. Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step toward achieving Palestinian national unity.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

What does it mean and who are these Palestinian groups?", "body": "Palestinian factions and bitter foes Hamas and Fatah have signed a declaration in China vowing to form a unity government that would rule over the occupied West Bank and Gaza when the Israel-Hamas war ends\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian factions and bitter foes Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in China vowing to form a unity government to govern the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip following the end of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe agreement announced in Beijing on Tuesday, which also included 12 smaller Palestinian parties, could start the thawing of relations and potential reconciliation of the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics who have long been at odds over the governance of the Palestinian territories.\n\nIsrael has ruled out any initiative that would lead to Hamas or the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority governing Gaza, and the China deal offers only a broad outline on how Fatah and Hamas would work together.\n\nHere is a look at the relationship between the two and the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAn agreement between old Palestinian foes\n\nThe secular Fatah party and Hamas, a Sunni Islamist party, have been at loggerheads since the late 1980s.\n\nTensions between the two climaxed after the second Intifada, or uprising, that ended in 2005. Hamas narrowly won Palestinian legislative elections in 2006 and seized power in Gaza the following year in a violent takeover. During the fighting, Fatah members were arrested and some were killed.\n\nHamas has ruled Gaza since, though Israel's campaign since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks has driven it underground.\n\nThe Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority controls parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has spent the last decade clamping down on dissent, rounding up and arresting Hamas members -- many of whom are wanted by Israel -- and posing little resistance to Israeli raids.\n\nIt is widely viewed as corrupt and many Palestinians consider it a subcontractor of the Israeli occupation because of their unpopular security coordination. Since the latest war in Gaza began, Israel has increased its operations in the West Bank and imposed sanctions on the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed reconciliation agreements in Cairo, Egypt, in 2011, and 11 years later in Algiers, Algeria, but their provisions were never implemented.\n\nThe Beijing declaration calls for a Palestinian state based on borders that were in place before Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in a 1967 war. But it offers only the broadest outline as to how the two factions would work together and provides no timeframe for its implementation.\n\nThe deal also does not address the groups' diverging views on Israel; Hamas has long refused to officially recognize Israel, while the Palestinian Authority has recognized Israel since they signed peace deals in the early 1990s and it supports a two-state solution.\n\nTahani Mustafa, an analyst with the Crisis Group, an international think tank, doubts that the Beijing agreement will mark a turning point.\n\n\"A lot of this was just a PR stunt,\" Mustafa said, adding that given the current situation, both factions had little to lose by signing it.\n\nIsrael says no to \"Hamastan\" and \"Fatahstan\"\n\nIsrael denounced the deal hours after it was signed, and has repeatedly said Hamas will have no involvement in the running of Gaza after the war. The U.S. and other Western countries have previously refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nThe joint declaration comes at a sensitive time in the 10-month war; Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Who will run Gaza after the war remains one of the thorniest unresolved issues in the negotiations in Cairo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he doesn't want the Palestinian Authority to participate in the future running of Gaza either.\n\n\"I am not prepared to switch from Hamastan to Fatahstan,\" Netanyahu announced in April, accusing both group's of posing security threats to Israel.\n\nNetanyahu's government and Israel's parliament have rejected the creation of a Palestinian state. Israel has not presented a cohesive vision for running post-war Gaza, raising the possibility of prolonged Israeli military control over the territory.\n\nBeijing brokering peace in the Middle East\n\nPerhaps the most significant thing about the deal was the location and the broker: China.\n\nBeijing has sought to position itself as a mediator in the region, despite not being part of the formal peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The move is widely seen as part of Xi Jinping's efforts to increase Beijing's global stature and act as a counterweight to Western influence.\n\nThe declaration in Beijing comes a year after China brokered a deal to normalize ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran after years of severed relations.\n\n\"If the Palestinian factions (especially Hamas and Fatah) are able to put into practice the reconciliation stated in the Beijing Declaration, then China's diplomatic influence in the Middle East will surely be boosted,\" James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said in an email.\n\nFind more of AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news",

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed Tuesday an accord brokered by China seeking reconciliation between Hamas and other Palestinian factions to form a national unity government in Gaza.\n\n\"I think all steps toward unity are to be welcomed and encouraged,\" his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, adding that Guterres \"very much welcomes the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the Palestinian factions.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hamas announced it had signed the agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organizations -- including rivals Fatah -- to work together for \"national unity.\"\n\nHamas and Fatah are long-term rivals and fought a brief but bloody war in 2007 in which the former seized control of Gaza.\n\nFatah continues to dominate the Palestinian Authority, which has limited administrative control over urban areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael swiftly slammed the Beijing-brokered deal, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz insisting that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\" and accusing Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, a leader of Fatah, of embracing the group whose October 7 attacks triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nThe text of the deal outlines plans for \"a temporary national unity government by agreement of the Palestinian factions\" which would \"exercise its authority and powers over all Palestinian territories\" -- the Gaza Strip as well the West Bank, including Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the factions had agreed to set up an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to govern post-war Gaza.\n\nSpeaking at the UN, spokesperson Dujarric said unity among the Palestinian factions was crucial.\n\n\"Palestinian unity... is crucial for peace and security and for advancing the aspirations of the Palestinian people for self determination and for fully independent, democratic, contiguous, viable and sovereign Palestinian state,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com",

The talks were held as the future governance of Palestinian territories remains in question following the Israel's repeated vow to eradicate Hamas in response to the group's October 7 terrorist attack on its territory.\n\nThe PLO is a coalition of parties that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993, and formed a new government in the Palestinian Authority (PA).\n\nFatah dominates both the PLO and the PA, the interim Palestinian government that was established in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after the 1993 agreement known as the Oslo Accords was signed. Hamas was not party to the accords and does not recognize Israel.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative, who was at the Beijing talks, said \"all the parties\" have agreed that they should join the PLO, and that the organization is the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians.\n\nThere is a long history of bitter enmity between Hamas and Fatah. The two sides have tried - and failed - multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure, with a 2017 agreement quickly folding in violence.\n\nThe PA held administrative control over Gaza until 2007, after Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and expelled it from the strip. Since then, Hamas has ruled Gaza and the PA governs parts of the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently evicted the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007.\n\nBut the deal's lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Hamdallah's Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.\n\nA common front against occupation\n\nBarghouti said the latest attempt at reconciling the Palestinian factions \"went much further\" than previous efforts and included \"specific steps\" towards the formation of a consensus government.\n\nThe war in Gaza, he told CNN, has prodded the factions to unite as a common front against Israel's occupation.\n\n\"There was a very clear feeling that what Israel is doing is really threatening everybody,\" he said. \"And so, in that sense, the feeling of unity (to) confront the Israeli side is very clear here.\"\n\nA new government would ensure the unity of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, ruling both territories after the war and effectively \"blocking Israeli efforts\" to maintain its occupation of Gaza, he said.\n\nMost Palestinians would however be taking the news about reconciliation \"with the usual caution and pessimism,\" said Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank.\n\n\"The major issues that have proven to be obstacles to reconciliation in the past were not addressed,\" she told CNN. \"It's very unlikely anything substantial will come out of this especially as the biggest obstacle so far has been (Palestinian Authority president and Fatah leader) Mahmoud Abbas (and) his absolute reluctance to relinquish in any way his monopoly on power.\"\n\nHamas is not opposed to the PLO but has instead demanded fair representation within the organization, she said. \"Abbas has been reluctant to provide this, as it would mean Fatah losing its hegemony over the last Palestinian political institution it controls.\"\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday in Beijing, Hamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook said they had reached an agreement to complete a \"course of reconciliation,\" while also using the platform in Beijing to defend the group's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\n\"We're at a historic junction. Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,\" Abu Marzook said, according to a translation provided by China's Foreign Ministry, adding that the October 7 operation had \"changed a lot, both in international and regional landscape.\"\n\nBeijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nChina's role\n\nTuesday's agreement follows an earlier round of talks between Hamas and Fatah hosted by Beijing in April.\n\nSince the start of the war in Gaza, China - which has looked to bolster its influence and ties in the Middle East in recent years - has presented itself as a leading voice for countries across the Global South decrying Israel's war in the enclave and calling for Palestinian statehood.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping in May called for an international peace conference during meetings with leaders from Arab nations and has also dispatched a special envoy to the Middle East to meet with diplomats and officials.\n\nObservers have questioned the extent of Beijing's geopolitical clout in a region where the US has long been a dominant power, but China surprised many last March when it played a role brokering a rapprochement between longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nThose efforts have been broadly seen as part of Beijing's push to position itself as a geopolitical heavyweight with a different vision for the world from the United States.\n\nTuesday's agreement was also inked as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the US for a highly anticipated visit in which he will meet top US officials and address Congress.\n\nIsrael launched its military operations in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 attack that killed more than 1,100 people and saw roughly 250 others kidnapped. Around 39,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict, which that has triggered a mass humanitarian crisis and widespread destruction.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., recalls being attacked by an anti-Israel protestor while attending the Republican National Convention.\n\nPalestinian factions including rivals Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their divisions and form an interim national unity government during negotiations in China that ended on Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout.\n\nPrevious efforts by Egypt and other Arab countries to reconcile Hamas and Fatah have failed to end 17 years of power-sharing conflict that have weakened Palestinian political aspirations, and it remains to be seen whether this deal will survive the realities on the ground.\n\nNETANYAHU'S MEETING AT WHITE HOUSE MOVED AMID BIDEN'S COVID RECOVERY, HARRIS CAMPAIGNING\n\nThe meeting was held amid attempts by international mediators to reach a ceasefire deal for Gaza, with one of the sticking points being the \"day-after\" plan - how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war that began on Oct. 7 ends.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the most important point of the Beijing Declaration was to form a Palestinian national unity government to manage the affairs of Palestinians.\n\n\"This creates a formidable barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests in managing Palestinian affairs post-war,\" Badran said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy the Iran-backed Hamas group and opposes it having any role in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, (Fatah leader) Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. In reality, this won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\nBadran said the national unity government would manage the affairs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nCurrently, Hamas runs Gaza and Fatah forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. There has been no immediate comment from Fatah.\n\nDetails of the agreement did not set out a timeframe for forming a new government. In March, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, appointed a new government led by one of his close aides, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happen without U.S. approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\n\"What happened in China was nothing but a meeting, a celebratory event, but it is impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days,\" said Abouelhoul, managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram.\n\nISRAEL STRIKES IRAN-BACKED HOUTHIS AFTER TEHRAN PROXY ATTACKED JEWISH STATE: 'SIGNIFICANCE IS CLEAR'\n\nFEUDING FACTIONS\n\nNonetheless, the agreement marks a diplomatic coup for Beijing and its growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during the closing ceremony, according to the readout.\n\n\"China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\"\n\nThe most \"prominent highlight\" was the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, Wang said, adding that the international community should support efforts to form an interim Palestinian government to control Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad are not members of the PLO, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, but they demand that any unity deal includes holding an election for the PLO parliament to secure their inclusion. The Islamist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded blame.\n\nThe long-feuding Palestinian factions have previously failed to heal their political disputes after Hamas fighters expelled Fatah from Gaza in a short war in 2007.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "foxwilmington.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hamas narrowly won Palestinian legislative elections in 2006 and seized power in Gaza the following year in a violent takeover. During the fighting, Fatah members were arrested and some were killed.\n\nChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, center, hosts an event for Mahmoud al-Aloul, left, vice chairman of Fatah, and Mussa Abu Marzuk, a senior member of Hamas, to meet at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Tuesday, July 23, 2024. (Pedro Pardo/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nHamas has ruled Gaza since, though Israel\u00b4s campaign since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks has driven it underground.\n\nThe Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority controls parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has spent the last decade clamping down on dissent, rounding up and arresting Hamas members - many of whom are wanted by Israel - and posing little resistance to Israeli raids.\n\nIt is widely viewed as corrupt and many Palestinians consider it a subcontractor of the Israeli occupation because of their unpopular security coordination. Since the latest war in Gaza began, Israel has increased its operations in the West Bank and imposed sanctions on the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed reconciliation agreements in Cairo, Egypt, in 2011, and 11 years later in Algiers, Algeria, but their provisions were never implemented.\n\nThe Beijing declaration calls for a Palestinian state based on borders that were in place before Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in a 1967 war. But it offers only the broadest outline as to how the two factions would work together and provides no timeframe for its implementation.\n\nThe deal also does not address the groups' diverging views on Israel; Hamas has long refused to officially recognize Israel, while the Palestinian Authority has recognized Israel since they signed peace deals in the early 1990s and it supports a two-state solution.\n\nTahani Mustafa, an analyst with the Crisis Group, an international think tank, doubts that the Beijing agreement will mark a turning point.\n\n\"A lot of this was just a PR stunt,\" Mustafa said, adding that given the current situation, both factions had little to lose by signing it.\n\nIsrael denounced the deal hours after it was signed, and has repeatedly said Hamas will have no involvement in the running of Gaza after the war. The U.S. and other Western countries have previously refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nThe joint declaration comes at a sensitive time in the 10-month war; Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Who will run Gaza after the war remains one of the thorniest unresolved issues in the negotiations in Cairo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he doesn't want the Palestinian Authority to participate in the future running of Gaza either.\n\n\"I am not prepared to switch from Hamastan to Fatahstan,\" Netanyahu announced in April, accusing both group's of posing security threats to Israel.\n\nNetanyahu\u00b4s government and Israel\u00b4s parliament have rejected the creation of a Palestinian state. Israel has not presented a cohesive vision for running post-war Gaza, raising the possibility of prolonged Israeli military control over the territory.\n\nPerhaps the most significant thing about the deal was the location and the broker: China.\n\nBeijing has sought to position itself as a mediator in the region, despite not being part of the formal peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The move is widely seen as part of Xi Jinping's efforts to increase Beijing's global stature and act as a counterweight to Western influence.\n\nThe declaration in Beijing comes a year after China brokered a deal to normalize ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran after years of severed relations.\n\n\"If the Palestinian factions (especially Hamas and Fatah) are able to put into practice the reconciliation stated in the Beijing Declaration, then China\u00b4s diplomatic influence in the Middle East will surely be boosted,\" James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defense and

The agreement was signed by long-term rivals Hamas and Fatah, as well as 12 other Palestinian groups.\n\n\"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity,\" said senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk at a news conference in Beijing.\n\nBlocking Israeli control of Gaza\n\nMustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, one of the 14 factions to sign the accord, told Al Jazeera the agreement goes \"much further\" than any other reached in recent years.\n\nHe said its four main elements are the establishment of an interim national unity government, the formation of unified Palestinian leadership ahead of future elections, the free election of a new Palestinian National Council, and a general declaration of unity in the face of ongoing Israeli attacks.\n\nThe move towards a unity government is especially important, he said, because it \"blocks Israeli efforts to create some sort of collaborative structure against Palestinian interests\".\n\nReconciliation between Hamas and Fatah would be a key turning point in internal Palestinian relations. The two main Palestinian political parties in the Palestinian territory have been bitter rivals since conflict arose in 2006, after which Hamas seized control of Gaza.\n\n'No other way'\n\n\"We're at a historic junction,\" Abu Marzouk said, according to CNN. \"Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle.\"\n\nHamas, which led the October 7 attack on Israel, advocates for armed resistance against Israel's occupation.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control of the occupied West Bank. It favours peaceful negotiations in pursuit of a Palestinian state.\n\nSeveral past reconciliation bids between the two factions have failed. However, calls have grown for them to come together as the war has dragged on and Israel and its allies, including the United States, have discussed who could govern the enclave after the fighting ends.\n\nBarghouti said the war in Gaza was the \"main factor\" motivating the Palestinian sides to set aside their differences.\n\n\"There is no other way now but for Palestinians to be unified and struggle together against this terrible injustice,\" he said.\n\n\"The most important thing now is to not only sign the agreement, but to implement it.\"\n\n'Watching from afar'\n\nIsrael vehemently opposes any Hamas role in governing Gaza, and has suggested in the face of opposition even from Washington that it intends to maintain control of the enclave.\n\nIsrael was, therefore, quick to slam the announced deal.\n\nTargeting Fatah chief and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for cooperating with Hamas, Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz reasserted his government's stance that no one but Israel will control Gaza following the end of hostilities.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,\" Katz claimed on X. \"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\n'Internal matter'\n\nChina, which has sought to play a mediating role in the conflict, previously hosted Fatah and Hamas in April.\n\nDuring those talks, the pair \"expressed their political will to achieve reconciliation through dialogue and consultation\" and made progress on \"many specific issues\", Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian said at the time.\n\nThe latest round of talks featured Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh and Fatah's deputy head Mahmoud al-Aloul.\n\nFollowing the signing of what has been referred to as the \"Beijing Declaration\", China's Wang said: \"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community.\"\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has called for an \"international peace conference\" to end the war.__Al Jazeera", "source": {"uri": "voiceofvienna.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "voiceofvienna.org"},

REUTERS\n\nPalestinian rivals including Hamas and Fatah agreed to form a unity government at talks hosted by China, Beijing said on Tuesday, a deal meant to deliver a post-war Gaza administration but quickly rejected by Israel as it seeks to crush Hamas.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an \"interim national reconciliation government \" to govern post-war Gaza.\n\nAnalysts said the agreement would prove hard to seal, with complications including the deep enmity between Palestinian factions and Western opposition to Hamas having any role in governance. No timetable was declared for implementation.\n\nAnalysts believe hostility between the two feuding Palestinian camps will be difficult to overcome despite the more than 39,000 Palestinians already killed in the Gaza war.\n\n\"What happened in China isn't significant,\" Jehad Harb, an analyst of Palestinian affairs told The New York Times. \"There aren't any indications that Hamas and Fatah intend to end the split between them.\"\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout.\n\nThe meeting marked the latest attempt to heal the Palestinian national schism that has defied all attempts at mediation since 2007, when the Islamist group Hamas seized the Gaza Strip in a brief civil war with Fatah.\n\nThe meeting was held amid attempts by mediators to reach a ceasefire deal after nine months of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. One of the sticking points is the \"day-after\" plan, how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war, which began on October 7, ends.\n\nHamas welcomed the declaration, saying it created a \"barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests\".\n\nBut there was no immediate comment from the Fatah movement led by President Mahmoud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In March, Abbas appointed a new Palestinian Authority (PA) government led by one of his allies, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nIsrael signalled its objection to the Beijing announcement, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz saying on X that Abbas had embraced \"the murderers and rapists of Hamas\" instead of \"rejecting terrorism\".\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Katz said.\n\nShunned by the West as a terrorist group even before October 7, Hamas has previously said it might be willing to play no role in Gaza's post-war governance and has sought agreement with Fatah on a post-war, technocratic PA government.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has insisted his goal is to destroy the militant, Iran-backed Hamas and opposes it having any part in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\nNetanyahu's right-wing government, which rejects Palestinians' quest for an independent state, has also objected to a revamped PA returning to govern Gaza, an idea supported by the United States and its Arab allies.\n\nThe most prominent highlight in the deal was a plan to form an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza as well as of the West Bank, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the unity government would also oversee reconstruction and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs and managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happen without US approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\nDismissing the China meeting as \"a celebratory event\", he said it was \"impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days\".\n\nNonetheless, the agreement further demonstrates Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between long-standing regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\nSince then, China has been eyeing an enhanced presence in the Middle East with Wang saying it was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday welcomed the Beijing Declaration. .\n\n\"I think all steps towards unity are to be welcomed and encouraged,\" his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, adding that Guterres \"very much welcomes the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the Palestinian factions.\"", "source": {"uri": "thearabweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

\"very much welcomes the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the Palestinian factions.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hamas announced it had signed the agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organizations -- including rivals Fatah -- to work together for \"national unity.\"\n\nHamas and Fatah are long-term rivals and fought a brief but bloody war in 2007 in which the former seized control of Gaza.\n\nFatah continues to dominate the Palestinian Authority, which has limited administrative control over urban areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael swiftly slammed the Beijing-brokered deal, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz insisting that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\" and accusing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a leader of Fatah, of embracing the group resisting the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe text of the deal outlines plans for \"a temporary national unity government by agreement of the Palestinian factions\" which would \"exercise its authority and powers over all Palestinian territories\" -- the Gaza Strip as well the West Bank, including Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the factions had agreed to set up an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to govern post-war Gaza.\n\nSpeaking at the UN, spokesperson Dujarric said unity amongst the Palestinian factions was crucial.\n\n\"Palestinian unity... is crucial for peace and security and for advancing the aspirations of the Palestinian people for self determination and for fully independent, democratic, contiguous, viable and sovereign Palestinian state,\" he said.\n\nIsrael's war on the Gaza Strip has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nAn analysis

What does it mean and who are these Palestinian groups?", "body": "RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian factions and bitter foes Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in China vowing to form a unity government to govern the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip following the end of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe agreement announced in Beijing on Tuesday, which also included 12 smaller Palestinian parties, could start the thawing of relations and potential reconciliation of the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics who have long been at odds over the governance of the Palestinian territories.\n\nIsrael has ruled out any initiative that would lead to Hamas or the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority governing Gaza, and the China deal offers only a broad outline on how Fatah and Hamas would work together.\n\nHere is a look at the relationship between the two and the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAn agreement between old Palestinian foes\n\nThe secular Fatah party and Hamas, a Sunni Islamist party, have been at loggerheads since the late 1980s.\n\nTensions between the two climaxed after the second Intifada, or uprising, that ended in 2005. Hamas narrowly won Palestinian legislative elections in 2006 and seized power in Gaza the following year in a violent takeover. During the fighting, Fatah members were arrested and some were killed.\n\nHamas has ruled Gaza since, though Israel's campaign since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks has driven it underground.\n\nThe Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority controls parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has spent the last decade clamping down on dissent, rounding up and arresting Hamas members -- many of whom are wanted by Israel -- and posing little resistance to Israeli raids.\n\nIt is widely viewed as corrupt and many Palestinians consider it a subcontractor of the Israeli occupation because of their unpopular security coordination. Since the latest war in Gaza began, Israel has increased its operations in the West Bank and imposed sanctions on the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed reconciliation agreements in Cairo, Egypt, in 2011, and 11 years later in Algiers, Algeria, but their provisions were never implemented.\n\nThe Beijing declaration calls for a Palestinian state based on borders that were in place before Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in a 1967 war. But it offers only the broadest outline as to how the two factions would work together and provides no timeframe for its implementation.\n\nThe deal also does not address the groups' diverging views on Israel; Hamas has long refused to officially recognize Israel, while the Palestinian Authority has recognized Israel since they signed peace deals in the early 1990s and it supports a two-state solution.\n\nTahani Mustafa, an analyst with the Crisis Group, an international think tank, doubts that the Beijing agreement will mark a turning point.\n\n\"A lot of this was just a PR stunt,\" Mustafa said, adding that given the current situation, both factions had little to lose by signing it.\n\nIsrael says no to \"Hamastan\" and \"Fatahstan\"\n\nIsrael denounced the deal hours after it was signed, and has repeatedly said Hamas will have no involvement in the running of Gaza after the war. The U.S. and other Western countries have previously refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nThe joint declaration comes at a sensitive time in the 10-month war; Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Who will run Gaza after the war remains one of the thorniest unresolved issues in the negotiations in Cairo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he doesn't want the Palestinian Authority to participate in the future running of Gaza either.\n\n\"I am not prepared to switch from Hamastan to Fatahstan,\" Netanyahu announced in April, accusing both group's of posing security threats to Israel.\n\nNetanyahu's government and Israel's parliament have rejected the creation of a Palestinian state. Israel has not presented a cohesive vision for running post-war Gaza, raising the possibility of prolonged Israeli military control over the territory.\n\nBeijing brokering peace in the Middle East\n\nPerhaps the most significant thing about the deal was the location and the broker: China.\n\nBeijing has sought to position itself as a mediator in the region, despite not being part of the formal peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The move is widely seen as part of Xi Jinping's efforts to increase Beijing's global stature and act as a counterweight to Western influence.\n\nThe declaration in Beijing comes a year after China brokered a deal to normalize ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran after years of severed relations.\n\n\"If the Palestinian factions (especially Hamas and Fatah) are able to put into practice the reconciliation stated in the Beijing Declaration, then China's diplomatic influence in the Middle East will surely be boosted,\" James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said in an email.\n\n___\n\nFind more of AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com",

What Does It Mean and Who Are These Palestinian Groups?", "body": "RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian factions and bitter foes Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in China vowing to form a unity government to govern the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip following the end of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe agreement announced in Beijing on Tuesday, which also included 12 smaller Palestinian parties, could start the thawing of relations and potential reconciliation of the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics who have long been at odds over the governance of the Palestinian territories.\n\nIsrael has ruled out any initiative that would lead to Hamas or the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority governing Gaza, and the China deal offers only a broad outline on how Fatah and Hamas would work together.\n\nHere is a look at the relationship between the two and the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAn agreement between old Palestinian foes\n\nThe secular Fatah party and Hamas, a Sunni Islamist party, have been at loggerheads since the late 1980s.\n\nTensions between the two climaxed after the second Intifada, or uprising, that ended in 2005. Hamas narrowly won Palestinian legislative elections in 2006 and seized power in Gaza the following year in a violent takeover. During the fighting, Fatah members were arrested and some were killed.\n\nHamas has ruled Gaza since, though Israel's campaign since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks has driven it underground.\n\nThe Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority controls parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has spent the last decade clamping down on dissent, rounding up and arresting Hamas members -- many of whom are wanted by Israel -- and posing little resistance to Israeli raids.\n\nIt is widely viewed as corrupt and many Palestinians consider it a subcontractor of the Israeli occupation because of their unpopular security coordination. Since the latest war in Gaza began, Israel has increased its operations in the West Bank and imposed sanctions on the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed reconciliation agreements in Cairo, Egypt, in 2011, and 11 years later in Algiers, Algeria, but their provisions were never implemented.\n\nThe Beijing declaration calls for a Palestinian state based on borders that were in place before Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in a 1967 war. But it offers only the broadest outline as to how the two factions would work together and provides no timeframe for its implementation.\n\nThe deal also does not address the groups' diverging views on Israel; Hamas has long refused to officially recognize Israel, while the Palestinian Authority has recognized Israel since they signed peace deals in the early 1990s and it supports a two-state solution.\n\nTahani Mustafa, an analyst with the Crisis Group, an international think tank, doubts that the Beijing agreement will mark a turning point.\n\n\"A lot of this was just a PR stunt,\" Mustafa said, adding that given the current situation, both factions had little to lose by signing it.\n\nIsrael says no to \"Hamastan\" and \"Fatahstan\"\n\nIsrael denounced the deal hours after it was signed, and has repeatedly said Hamas will have no involvement in the running of Gaza after the war. The U.S. and other Western countries have previously refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nThe joint declaration comes at a sensitive time in the 10-month war; Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Who will run Gaza after the war remains one of the thorniest unresolved issues in the negotiations in Cairo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he doesn't want the Palestinian Authority to participate in the future running of Gaza either.\n\n\"I am not prepared to switch from Hamastan to Fatahstan,\" Netanyahu announced in April, accusing both group's of posing security threats to Israel.\n\nNetanyahu's government and Israel's parliament have rejected the creation of a Palestinian state. Israel has not presented a cohesive vision for running post-war Gaza, raising the possibility of prolonged Israeli military control over the territory.\n\nBeijing brokering peace in the Middle East\n\nPerhaps the most significant thing about the deal was the location and the broker: China.\n\nBeijing has sought to position itself as a mediator in the region, despite not being part of the formal peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The move is widely seen as part of Xi Jinping's efforts to increase Beijing's global stature and act as a counterweight to Western influence.\n\nThe declaration in Beijing comes a year after China brokered a deal to normalize ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran after years of severed relations.\n\n\"If the Palestinian factions (especially Hamas and Fatah) are able to put into practice the reconciliation stated in the Beijing Declaration, then China's diplomatic influence in the Middle East will surely be boosted,\" James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said in an email.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The U.S. and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel -- a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\" The agreement offered only broad outlines for how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas terrorists.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war. The unity efforts are motivated in part by Palestinians' desire to offer a scenario for postwar rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it vowed to destroy after the the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, \"We made clear we want to see the Palestinian Authority\" with a governing role in Gaza, \"but no, we do not want to see a role for Hamas,\" which he said has \"blood on its hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Central_Television", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China Central Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/19425250_web1_19425250-7c3d780bc1ab48e8b28b1bec3e6de814.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2229, "textEnd": 2235}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Regarding peace agreements with Israel, the factions disagree with the PLO as it exists now.\n\nAccording to a release, Badran said, \"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nThe rival groups Hamas and Fatah convened in Beijing in April to deliberate on efforts to reconcile and put an end to almost 17 years of disagreements. This was the first known visit by a Hamas delegation to China since the start of the Gaza War.\n\nOriginally scheduled for last month, the second round of negotiations was postponed while both sides exchanged accusations.\n\nAfter Hamas troops drove Fatah from Gaza in a brief conflict in 2007, the long-running Palestinian groups have historically been unable to resolve their political differences.\n\nIn recent months, Chinese officials have become more vocal in their support of the Palestinians in international fora, demanding a more extensive Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a set timeline for the implementation of a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "pakistankakhudahafiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PKKH.tv"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This government would also prepare for future general elections.\n\nOn Tuesday (July 23), over 12 Palestinian factions, including rivals Fatah and Hamas, united under Beijing's auspices and signed a declaration to create a temporary unity government. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has praised the agreement, called the 'Beijing Declaration', as a \"historic moment for Palestine's liberation\". However, experts doubt that this effort, facilitated by China, will overcome the deep-seated conflicts between these groups.\n\nThe talks that started, on Sunday (July 21), were the second time this year that representatives from Hamas and Fatah met in Beijing. China is carefully trying to increase its influence in the Middle East, especially during the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. Regional experts believe China is using these talks to strengthen its diplomatic reputation as it aims to compete more with the US globally.\n\nThe document suggests forming a unified Palestinian government to manage the Palestinian areas, which include Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. This government would also prepare for future general elections.\n\nChinese state media swiftly highlighted the announcement as a significant achievement. The Global Times claimed that China had once again empowered global peace and stability in a world full of turmoil. Similarly, state news agency Xinhua called the agreement an instance of China's efforts to nurture a global community with a common future.\n\nHamas, the Islamist militant group that ruled the Gaza Strip until the recent conflict, and Fatah, the secular political party that runs the Palestinian Authority in parts of Israeli-occupied West Bank, had a fierce civil war in 2006-2007. During this conflict, Hamas took control of Gaza, and the two groups have been strongly opposed to each other ever since.\n\nThe agreement was reached just weeks after tensions seemed to rise between the two groups. Fatah leader and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas blamed Hamas for the conflict, and said it was legally, morally and politically to blame. In response, senior Hamas officials accused Fatah of siding with Israel.\n\nKhaled Elgindy, director of the Middle East Institute's programme on Palestine and Israeli-Palestinian affairs, noted that many attempts to unite the two main Palestinian political groups had failed over the years. Even this time, experts are sceptical about the 'Beijing Declaration' succeeding, according to Foreign Policy media house.\n\nElgindy said he did not see much new there and added that there had been many agreements, starting with that in Cairo in 2011. He also mentioned the recent Moscow statement, referring to past mediation efforts. Russia has hosted several talks among Palestinian factions in Moscow, the latest being in February.\n\nElgindy pointed out that the 'Beijing Declaration' did not include a plan on how to put its promises into action. A senior Fatah official, speaking anonymously to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, mentioned that the agreement was mainly signed out of respect for their Chinese hosts.\n\nAssaf Orion, director of the Israel-China programme at the Institute for National Security Studies, told Foreign Policy that he saw this as China's quest for a cheap diplomatic reputation. He said it was mostly about appearances, allowing China to present itself as an important power broker in the Middle East, a role traditionally held by the US. Beijing has had long-standing ties with the Palestinians and was one of the first countries to recognize a Palestinian state in 1988.\n\nAhmed Aboudouh, an expert on China's growing influence in the Middle East at Chatham House -- a renowned British think tank -- said China's push for Palestinian unity sent a strong message to countries in the Global South and the Islamic world. These regions have reacted strongly against Israel's harsh military actions in Gaza.\n\nBy taking this stance, Beijing aims to position itself as an alternative to the Western-led order in an increasingly multi-polar world. The US has traditionally led diplomatic efforts between Israelis and Palestinians. It is also involved with Qatar and Egypt in trying to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. China's efforts at making a deal among the Palestinian factions show its strategy of focusing on smaller parts of major crises.\n\nAlthough few breakthroughs are expected from the recent talks in Beijing with the Palestinian factions, Elgindy said political reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah would be crucial for effective governance in Gaza after the war. With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu determined to eliminate Hamas following its attack on October 7, 2023, the US sees the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority as the best option to take control in Gaza after the conflict ends. However, Netanyahu has firmly rejected this idea.\n\nEven though the war has greatly weakened Hamas's military and governing abilities, US officials and experts doubt that the group and its ideology can be completely eliminated. This means that, without some sort of agreement between the two groups, Hamas could disrupt things in Gaza if the Palestinian Authority returns to govern the area. According to Elgindy, the Palestinian Authority could not return to Gaza and function without at least some cooperation from Hamas.\n\n(The author of this article is a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

The coalition, termed 'interim national reconciliation government', signed the Beijing Declaration, which was described by China as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends, according to AFP reports.\n\nAfter the meeting, Hamas representative Musa Abu Marzuk was quoted by AFP as saying, \"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it.\"\n\nFatah, which has majority in the Palestinian Authority that has administrative control over West Bank, was represented in the meeting by Mahmud alAloul.\n\nAn AFP report quoted him thanking China for its \"unending support\" for the Palestinian cause. \"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,\" he was quoted by AFP to have said.\n\nAs yesterd ay 's meeting wrapped up, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted the delegates of the meeting, said the Palestinian groups had committed to reconciliation.\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang told AFP after the factions signed the 'Beijing Declaration' in the Chinese capital. He added, \"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community.\"\n\nWhat's the Deal\n\nThe text of the deal outlines plans for \"a temporary national unity government by agreement of the Palestinian factions\" which would \"exercise its authority and powers over all Palestinian territories\" - the Gaza Strip as well as the West Bank, including Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.\n\nIsrael's Response\n\nA swift condemnation of the deal came from Israel, with its Foreign Minister Israel Katz being quoted by AFP as saying that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\".\n\nHe was also reported by AFP to have accused Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, whose Fatah faction signed the deal, of embracing the group whose October 7 attacks triggered the war.\n\nHe also rejected any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, saying \"Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar\".\n\nHamas' attacks on southern Israel on October 7th last year had resulted in the death of 1,197 people.\n\nOver 250 hostages were seized by Hamas, of which 116 are yet to be released.\n\nMilitary campaign\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has so far taken the lives of over 39,000 civilians, mostly women and children.\n\nUN Reaction\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the accord brokered by China.\n\n\"I think all steps towards unity are to be welcomed and encouraged,\" his spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said, adding that Guterres \"very much welcomes the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the Palestinian factions.\" Speaking at the UN, spokesperson Dujarric said unity amongst the Palestinian factions was crucial.\n\n\"Palestinian unity... is crucial for peace and security and for advancing the aspirations of the Palestinian people for self-determination and for fully independent, democratic, contiguous, viable and sovereign Palestinian state,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "newsofbahrain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DT News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki",

Both sides said the accord, which provided no guarantees, was only an initial step, and they promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in 2011 and 2022.\n\nIsrael swiftly denounced the pact. The US and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas, unless it expressly recognises Israel - a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity\". The agreement offered only broad outlines for how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed ceasefire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war. The unity efforts are in part motivated by Palestinians' desire to offer a potential vision for post-war rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it vowed to destroy after the militants' October 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected US calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive post-war vision of its own.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Central_Television", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China Central Television"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2024/07/24/2877775/8086273.jpg?itok=XyDbROC5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2426, "textEnd": 2435}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

When it comes to governance of Gaza at the end of the conflict, there can't be a role for a terrorist organisation.\"\n\nHe added the US would \"like to see the Palestinian Authority governing a unified Gaza and the West Bank, but no, we cannot support a role for Hamas\".\n\n14 Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Fatah, have agreed in the Chinese capital of Beijing to achieve \"a comprehensive national unity\" under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\n\nThe announcement was made in a joint statement at the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Beijing following China's invitation to intra-Palestinian talks.\n\nThe statement said the Palestinian groups \"agreed on achieving a comprehensive national unity that includes all Palestinian factions within the frame of PLO, and on the commitment to the establishment of the independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the UN resolutions and ensuring the right of return as based in resolution 194\".\n\nThe Palestinian groups also agreed on \"uniting national efforts\" to stop the Israeli genocide in Gaza and to resist attempts to expel Palestinians from their lands.\n\nThe Fatah Movement, Hamas Movement, Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and other Palestinian groups took part in the talks.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the deal as an agreement to rule the Gaza Strip together once the ongoing war ends.\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" he stated.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it

The clauses of the agreement outlined that all factions should work to end the siege imposed on the Palestinian people in the Gaza strip and the West Bank, and to guarantee unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people.\n\nAdditionally, Palestinian factions agreed to \"confront conspiracies of the Israeli occupation and its continuous violations against Al-Aqsa Mosque, and resist any harm to it and the city of Al-Quds and its sanctities,\" according to information obtained by Al Mayadeen [the Lebanese pan-Arabist satellite news television].\n\nFurthermore, the agreement called for guaranteeing the Palestinian right of return in accordance with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194.

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Hamas political bureau member, Mousa Abu Marzook, said on Tuesday after meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and emissaries from other Palestinian groups, namely Fatah, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).\n\nWang, for his part, said the Palestinian envoys had agreed to set up an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to govern post-war Gaza.\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" he said, following the signing of the \"Beijing Declaration\" by the factions in the Chinese capital.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\nChina, he added, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability\" in the West Asia region.\n\nBeijing, Wang said, called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nMeanwhile, Hamas said in a statement that the Palestinian factions welcomed the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that said Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful and should come to an end \"as rapidly as possible.\"\n\nIt called for the implementation of agreements struck with the help of Egypt, Algeria, China and Russia, which demand an end to divisions among Palestinian groups.\n\nHamas went on to highlight that the Palestinian factions reaffirmed their commitment to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with al-Quds as its capital in accordance with international resolutions, particularly 181 and 2334, and the Palestinian right of return.\n\nThe statement noted that Palestinian groups will work to reach a consensus on formation of a temporary national unity government, which will exercise sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, holy al-Quds, and the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Palestinian envoys also agreed to resist and thwart Israeli attempts aimed at displacement of Palestinians from their ancestral homes in the West Bank, al-Quds and the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe emissaries reached an agreement as well to strive for the removal of the Gaza blockade and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid into the coastal territory.\n\nThe announcement of the Palestinian 'national unity' deal comes more than nine months after Israel launched the war on Gaza following Palestinian resistance groups' surprise retaliatory operation into the occupied territories.\n\nSo far during the military onslaught, the regime has killed at least 39,006 Gazans, most of them women, children, and adolescents. Another 89,818 Palestinians have sustained injuries as well.\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and supportive of a so-called two-state solution to the decades-long

This agreement, described as a move toward \"national unity,\" was hailed by some as a pivotal moment in the fractured landscape of Palestinian politics. According to the Chinese foreign ministry, the reconciliation outlines a plan for the joint administration of Gaza once the Israel-Hamas war comes to an end.\n\nThe agreement was finalized after negotiations held in Beijing, which brought together 14 Palestinian factions that are often at odds with each other. China - looking to increase its geopolitical power by brokering deals - views the accord as a crucial step toward stabilizing the region and paving the way for coordinated governance in Gaza.\n\nThe roots of the current divide trace back to 2007, when Hamas and Fatah were engaged in a civil war. After Hamas won the elections in Gaza, a national-unity government failed, leading to Hamas's forceful takeover of the Strip from the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority. The two factions have been deeply divided for years, each striving to present itself as the legitimate leader of the Palestinian people.\n\nFor many Palestinians, the recent agreement signed in Beijing represents yet another instance of rhetoric without substantive or real action. Despite the hopeful language and diplomatic efforts, there remains a pervasive skepticism about the ability of the current Palestinian leadership to effectively navigate the complex and continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe historical context is telling. Over the years, multiple attempts have been made to bridge the divide between Hamas and Fatah, including significant efforts by Egypt and other Arab nations. These attempts, however, have consistently fallen short, resulting in nothing more than joint statements and agreements that failed to materialize into tangible progress. The 17 years of conflict between these two factions have not only undermined Palestinian political aspirations - they have also left the Palestinian people disillusioned and exhausted.\n\nThis recurring cycle of announcements and failed implementations has only deepened the despair among Gazans. The agreement, while diplomatically significant, needs to be backed by concrete actions to rebuild trust and foster a genuine path toward peace and stability. Until then, the people of Gaza remain skeptical, yearning for leadership that not only makes promises but also delivers on them.\n\nThe timing of this reconciliation effort is particularly problematic, as it comes too late, arriving amidst nine months of relentless war and widespread destruction. Gazans view this reconciliation as another set of lofty statements that fail to address their immediate needs. The focus should have been on reaching an agreement to end the war and mitigate suffering, rather than on reconciliation that only contemplates post-war scenarios. The question remains: How will the Palestinian factions, especially Hamas, which initiated the war, and Fatah, regarded as the legitimate representative of the Palestinians by many in the international community, respond to the urgent needs and concerns arising from the continuing war? The agreement's emphasis on post-war governance seems detached from the urgent realities faced by those living under siege.\n\nThis reconciliation agreement also included smaller Palestinian factions and highlighted the necessity of creating a unity Palestinian government that would focus on merging institutions in the West Bank and Gaza, rebuilding Gaza, and preparing for national elections. However, the statement noticeably lacks a clear timeline for these objectives, exacerbating public frustration. Many remain skeptical that Hamas and Fatah truly intend to work together.\n\nThe reaction to the Beijing agreement from Israel has been swift and firm. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz promptly rejected the deal, emphasizing that there is no prospect for joint rule between Fatah and Hamas in Gaza. Mr. Katz asserted that Hamas's rule in the Strip would be dismantled, reflecting Israel's strong opposition to any arrangement that includes power-sharing with many Palestinian factions.\n\nAs we watch this new development unfold, the question remains: Will this agreement mark the beginning of a new era of Palestinian unity and resilience, or will it be yet another missed opportunity in the long history of failed reconciliations? For now, the Palestinian people continue to hope for leadership that not only signs agreements, but also takes meaningful actions to achieve lasting peace and security.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/5WNYTEVWKNBD3KZB4AO26ABQVQ.jpeg?auth=d901649a21db0a67115f380c5e14b200958c8e5f9f1e6651cdc0c2e0cc272a49&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

It remains to be seen whether the deal reached in Beijing will survive the realities on the ground.\n\nThe two sides violently split when Hamas fighters drove Fatah forces out of Gaza in 2007 and seized control of the coastal enclave.\n\nVOA's State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cambodiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cambodian Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mao Zedong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza\u2013Israel_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza\u2013Israel conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peace treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1721765206.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "dateEnd": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 273, "textEnd": 286}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1284, "textEnd": 1293}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

PEDRO PARDO/Pool via REUTERS\n\nPalestinian rivals including Hamas and Fatah agreed to form a unity government at talks hosted by China, Beijing said on Tuesday, a deal meant to deliver a post-war Gaza administration but quickly rejected by Israel as it seeks to crush Hamas.\n\nAnalysts said the agreement would prove hard to implement, with complications including the deep enmity between Palestinian factions and Western opposition to Hamas having any role in governance. No timetable was declared for implementation.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout.\n\nThe meeting marked the latest attempt to heal the Palestinian national schism that has defied all attempts at mediation since 2007, when the Islamist group Hamas seized the Gaza Strip in a brief civil war with Fatah.\n\nThe meeting was held amid attempts by mediators to reach a ceasefire deal after nine months of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. One of the sticking points is the \"day-after\" plan - how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war, which began on Oct 7, ends.\n\nHamas welcomed the declaration, saying it created a \"barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests\".\n\nBut there was no immediate comment from the Fatah movement led by President Mahmoud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In March, Abbas appointed a new Palestinian Authority (PA) government led by one of his allies, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nIsrael signalled its objection, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz saying on X that Abbas had embraced \"the murderers and rapists of Hamas\" instead of \"rejecting terrorism\".\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Katz said.\n\nShunned by the West as a terrorist group even before Oct 7, Hamas has previously said it might be willing to play no role in Gaza's post-war governance and has sought agreement with Fatah on a post-war, technocratic PA government.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy the militant, Iran-backed Hamas and opposes it having any part in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\nNetanyahu's right-wing government, which rejects Palestinians' quest for an independent state, has also objected to a revamped PA returning to govern Gaza - an idea supported by the United States and its Arab allies.\n\nThe most prominent highlight in the deal was a plan to form an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza as well as of the West Bank, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the unity government would also oversee reconstruction and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs and managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happen without US approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\nDismissing the China meeting as \"a celebratory event\", he said it was \"impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days\".\n\nNonetheless, the agreement further demonstrates Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news",

The West led by U.S. did not accept the victory of Hamas in 2006 Gaza Elections. Israel went a step further and announced the blockade of the strip.\n\nSince then, Hamas and other groups of Palestinian Resistance Fighters engaged with Israeli Occupation Forces multiple times. Tension between them escalated at unprecedented level when the Resistance stormed the occupied territories under the Zionist control by sea, land and air on October 07, 2023.\n\nThe far right Zionist regime in Israel retaliated with a deadly war that has so far killed close to 39,000 Palestinians - more than 70% of them women and children.\n\nThe Israeli brutality has prompted International Court of Justice (ICJ) to order probe if the Israeli Occupation Forces are guilty of war crimes and genocide. The ICJ has also called for immediate ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nThe signing of Beijing Declaration comes days after the ICJ in another ruling termed illegal the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian lands. The Zionists however remain adamant and are ready neither to end the Gaza war nor the illegal occupation of Palestine.\n\nMeanwhile, talking about the Beijing Declaration, Mustafa Barghouti, Secretary General of the Palestinian National Initiative, one of the 14 factions to sign the accord, told Al Jazeera the agreement goes \"much further\" than any other reached in recent years.\n\nHe said its four main elements are the establishment of an interim national unity government, the formation of unified Palestinian leadership ahead of future elections, the free election of a new Palestinian National Council, and a general declaration of unity in the face of ongoing Israeli attacks.\n\nThe move towards a unity government is especially important, he said, because it \"blocks Israeli efforts to create some sort of collaborative structure against Palestinian interests\".", "source": {"uri": "ummid.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.ummid.com/"}, "authors": [],

Hamas narrowly won Palestinian legislative elections in 2006 and seized power in Gaza the following year in a violent takeover. During the fighting, Fatah members were arrested and some were killed.\n\nHamas has ruled Gaza since, though Israel's campaign since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks has driven it underground.\n\nThe Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority controls parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has spent the last decade clamping down on dissent, rounding up and arresting Hamas members -- many of whom are wanted by Israel -- and posing little resistance to Israeli raids.\n\nIt is widely viewed as corrupt and many Palestinians consider it a subcontractor of the Israeli occupation because of their unpopular security coordination. Since the latest war in Gaza began, Israel has increased its operations in the West Bank and imposed sanctions on the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed reconciliation agreements in Cairo, Egypt, in 2011, and 11 years later in Algiers, Algeria, but their provisions were never implemented.\n\nThe Beijing declaration calls for a Palestinian state based on borders that were in place before Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in a 1967 war. But it offers only the broadest outline as to how the two factions would work together and provides no timeframe for its implementation.\n\nThe deal also does not address the groups' diverging views on Israel; Hamas has long refused to officially recognize Israel, while the Palestinian Authority has recognized Israel since they signed peace deals in the early 1990s and it supports a two-state solution.\n\nTahani Mustafa, an analyst with the Crisis Group, an international think tank, doubts that the Beijing agreement will mark a turning point.\n\n\"A lot of this was just a PR stunt,\" Mustafa said, adding that given the current situation, both factions had little to lose by signing it.\n\nIsrael says no to \"Hamastan\" and \"Fatahstan\": Israel denounced the deal hours after it was signed, and has repeatedly said Hamas will have no involvement in the running of Gaza after the war. The U.S. and other Western countries have previously refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nThe joint declaration comes at a sensitive time in the 10-month war; Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Who will run Gaza after the war remains one of the thorniest unresolved issues in the negotiations in Cairo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he doesn't want the Palestinian Authority to participate in the future running of Gaza either.\n\n\"I am not prepared to switch from Hamastan to Fatahstan,\" Netanyahu announced in April, accusing both group's of posing security threats to Israel.\n\nNetanyahu's government and Israel's parliament have rejected the creation of a Palestinian state. Israel has not presented a cohesive vision for running post-war Gaza, raising the possibility of prolonged Israeli military control over the territory.\n\nBeijing brokering peace in the Middle East: Perhaps the most significant thing about the deal was the location and the broker: China.\n\nBeijing has sought to position itself as a mediator in the region, despite not being part of the formal peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The move is widely seen as part of Xi Jinping's efforts to increase Beijing's global stature and act as a counterweight to Western influence.\n\nThe declaration in Beijing comes a year after China brokered a deal to normalize ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran after years of severed relations.\n\n\"If the Palestinian factions (especially Hamas and Fatah) are able to put into practice the reconciliation stated in the Beijing Declaration, then China's diplomatic influence in the Middle East will surely be boosted,\" James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said in an email.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nAlso read Palestinians hail ICJ ruling, condemnation

39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nThe relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.\n\nAs Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said following the signing of the \"Beijing declaration\" by the factions in the Chinese capital.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\n'Peace and stability'\n\nChina, he added, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nBeijing, Wang said, called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nSeveral reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.\n\nChina hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@gulfnews.com", "name":

The Israeli army's total fatalities since the launch of the onslaught is nearly 700.\n\nIn addition to dealing serious blows to Israeli forces, the resistance movement has also emerged as a political heavyweight in the international arena.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hamas and Fatah signed a Chinese-brokered agreement in Beijing as they seek to settle their differences and maintain Palestinian control over Gaza amid Israel's sinister postwar plans for the territory.\n\nAccording to Chinese media, the two Palestinian factions signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity\".\n\nOfficials from Hamas and Fatah met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday following reconciliation talks that also involved 12 other Palestinian factions.\n\nWang said the agreement was \"dedicated to the great reconciliation and unity of all 14 factions\".\n\nThe top Chinese diplomat noted that \"an agreement has been reached on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government\".\n\nHamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook highlighted the role of unity among Palestinians.\n\nThe singing of the deal, however, infuriated Israel.\n\nIsrael's postwar plots\n\nAccording to a document that was leaked weeks after October 7, the Israeli Intelligence Ministry had called on the regime's army to evacuate the civilian population to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.\n\nNetanyahu and his far-right ministers supported the mass expulsion of the Palestinians.\n\nThe Israeli regime is opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza after the war ends. Tel Aviv has also rejected calls from the administration of US President Joe Biden for the Palestinian Authority (PA) to run Gaza.\n\nPA remains unpopular\n\nFatah dominates both the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA). It is the interim Palestinian government established in the West Bank after the signing of the 1993 agreement known as the Oslo Accords.\n\nThe PA held administrative control over Gaza until 2007. But Hamas has ruled Gaza since then, a year after winning the 2006 legislative elections.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been bitter rivals since the latter won the 2006 elections.\n\nPalestinians view the PA as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nThe Palestinian public also believe that the PA, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, is unable to provide security in the face of regular Israeli incursions into the occupied West Bank.\n\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in December last year, more than 60% of Palestinians want the PA to be dissolved. The opinion poll also revealed that nearly 90% of respondents want President Abbas to step down.\n\nRising support for resistance\n\nHowever, support for Hamas has been growing since it conducted a surprise military operation in southern Israel on October 7 which was followed by the regime's genocidal war on the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe deal signed in China can pave the way for unifying Palestinians and foiling Israeli plots.\n\nHamas' growing political clout is rooted in the stiff resistance put up by its fighters in Gaza. In fact, the resilience of Palestinians has humiliated Israel and deepened its international isolation.\n\nNo to talks with Israel\n\nThe Palestinian Authority should realize that Israel only uses negotiations as a smokescreen to continue its land grab policy and prolong the occupation of Palestinian lands.\n\nFatah and Hamas can strengthen their unity if the Palestinian Authority throws its weight behind resistance movement against Israeli occupation and atrocities not only in the West Bank but also in Gaza.\n\nThe ball is now in the court of the Palestinian Authority. The PA should come to its senses and wake up to the fact that the Israeli occupation and brutalities will only end through resistance and unity among Palestinians. It should also understand that negotiations with Israel are a futile endeavor that will only embolden the apartheid regime to continue its atrocious crimes.\n\nChina's mediation skills\n\nBesides, the Hamas-Fatah agreement highlights the role of China as an international mediator and the erosion of the United States' international clout.\n\nSince the start of the Gaza war, China has called for a ceasefire and decried Israel's brutal war which has claimed the lives of more than 39,000 Palestinians. Beijing has also demanded that an independent Palestinian state be established.\n\nThis is while the US has provided unwavering support for Israel's war of genocide on Gaza and blocked efforts over the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nIn April, the United States blocked a widely-backed Security Council resolution that would have allowed the State of Palestine to be admitted as a full United Nations member.\n\nThe US was the only country that vetoed the resolution. Britain and Switzerland abstained while 12 countries in the 15-member body voted in favor which put the spotlight on Washington's growing international isolation.\n\nChina also stunned the world as it mediated a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia in March 2023.\n\nThe Chinese-brokered deal saw Tehran and Riyadh reestablish diplomatic relations after seven years.\n\nChina's mediation in brokering deals between Palestinian factions as well as Iran and Saudi Arabia indicates that Beijing has played a constructive role in the region.\n\nThis is while Washington's policies have fanned the flames of conflicts.\n\nChina is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The Asian country should use its leverage in the council and play a more crucial role in mediating\n\nconflicts and easing tensions in various regions.\n\nUndoubtedly, China is able to enhance global stability as a trusted and respected player on the international stage.\n\nFirst Published by Tehran times", "source": {"uri": "en.mehrnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mehr News Agency"},

This agreement is a significant development, particularly for China, which has been actively involved in the region.\n\nFourteen Palestinian parties, including Fatah and Hamas, signed a statement of \"national unity\" in Beijing on Tuesday. The agreement aims to maintain Palestinian control over Gaza when the war is over. The groups pledge to work together to unite Palestinian institutions in the West Bank and Gaza, and say they are preparing national elections, although concrete plans remain for the time being.\n\nPart of the new agreement is that Hamas will become part of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). This is a coalition of Palestinian parties that signed the Oslo Accords with Israel in 1993. These agreements gave rise to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which became responsible for their implementation. The PA has since governed parts of the West Bank. Fatah dominates both the PLO and the PA.\n\nReconciliation between Islamist Hamas and the secular Fatah would be a turning point. The two largest political parties have been bitter rivals since 2007. Hamas defeated President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah party in the parliamentary elections. When he did not recognize the result, all party members were violently deported from the Gaza Strip, and since then Hamas alone has ruled there. The other way around, also tell Hamas members about torture to which the PA exposed them.\n\nAnd even though both groups accept the 1967 borders - East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank - for the Palestinian state, they are far apart in terms of cooperation with Israel. Hamas does not recognize Israel and has never agreed to lay down its arms, says Gershon Baskin, an Israeli columnist and researcher who has negotiated with Hamas for years. Fatah is a cooperative. \"In the eyes of Hamas, Fatah, and with it, the PA and the PLO, consists of traitors because they work with Israel in terms of security.\"\n\nThe question is therefore whether the unit agreement made a difference. Multiple attempts to reconcile the two sides and unite the two Palestinian territories under one rule failed miserably. In 2017, such an agreement almost immediately collapsed when Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza and a bomb exploded near his convoy. Hamdallah's Fatah party blamed Hamas immediately.\n\nWhether the Palestinian parties are at a \"historic crossroads,\" as Hamas deputy delegate Abu Marzouk said on Tuesday, is the question. The proof is in the pudding, according to the Palestinians. \"First see if it is implemented,\" Baskin said.\n\nThe fourteen parties hope to be able to keep the Palestinian power after the war, because Hamas will not succeed on its own. It is still unclear what role Hamas would play in the planned unity government. Neither Israel nor the United States would approve a post-war plan in which Hamas holds power in Gaza.\n\nBeijing has long said it wanted stability and peace in the Middle East, and criticizes the U.S. for not taking both sides of the conflict into account. Now China has shown that it can negotiate and can actually be one of the players responsible for ending the war in Gaza.\n\nChina has invested a lot in the area over the past decade and wants to safeguard its economic interests. For the same reasons, China led talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran a year ago and approached the Houthis.\n\nBut to actually reach a ceasefire in Gaza, China will have to involve Israel. Aven's not going to accept that, given all the help it gives to Israel. And China cannot and will not replace U.S. military aid in the region by far.\n\nOfficials from the United States, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) also had a meeting on board in Gaza after the war last Thursday, reports the American news site Axios. They would have met in secret in Abu Dhabi.", "source": {"uri": "micetimes.asia", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mice Times of Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The U.S. and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel -- a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\" The agreement offered only broad outlines for how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war. The unity efforts are motivated in part by Palestinians' desire to offer a scenario for postwar rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it vowed to destroy after the militants' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah has been deeply reluctant to share power with its longtime rival. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and that it advocates for forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions. That government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions including Hamas said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognize Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognized Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s. Those deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving the authority in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves. Many Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organization, including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority. Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement after the talks saying it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it demanded the withdrawal of the PLO's recognition of Israel.\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

We are committed to national unity, and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nPEACE PLAYER? (From left) Mahmoud al-Aloul, vice chairman of Fatah's Central Committee; China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi; and Mussa Abu Marzuk, Hamas senior member, converse during an event at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in the Chinese capital Beijing on July 23, 2024. AFP PHOTO\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas' attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, an Agence France-Presse (AFP) tally based on Israeli figures show.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, data from the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules Gaza, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers, including key Israeli backer United States, have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.\n\nNeither Israel nor the US would sanction any postwar plan that includes Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organization by Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Reconciliation government'\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China.\n\nAs Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation.\"\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of postwar Gaza,\" Wang said after the factions signed the \"Beijing declaration\" in the Chinese capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\nFatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its \"unending support\" for the Palestinian cause.\n\n\"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,\" he said.\n\nNotably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, said Wang.\n\nEgypt, which neighbors Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict.\n\nAlgeria is a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council and has drafted resolutions on the war.\n\nAnd while Western powers have sought to isolate Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, China has maintained its strategic partnership with Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Peace and stability'\n\nChina, Wang said, is keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East.\"\n\nHe also called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire,\" as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from Gaza after deadly clashes that followed the former's resounding victory in a 2006 election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nSeveral reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas' October attacks and nine-month Gaza war, with violence also soaring in the West Bank, where Fatah is based.\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nChina has positioned itself as a more neutral actor on the Israel-Palestinian conflict than the US, advocating for a two-state solution while also maintaining good ties with Israel.\n\nAnd it has sought to play a greater role in the Middle East in recent years, facilitating last year's historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "source": {"uri":

The Israeli army's total fatalities since the launch of the onslaught is nearly 700.\n\nIn addition to dealing serious blows to Israeli forces, the resistance movement has also emerged as a political heavyweight in the international arena.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hamas and Fatah signed a Chinese-brokered agreement in Beijing as they seek to settle their differences and maintain Palestinian control over Gaza amid Israel's sinister postwar plans for the territory.\n\nAccording to Chinese media, the two Palestinian factions signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity\".\n\nOfficials from Hamas and Fatah met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday following reconciliation talks that also involved 12 other Palestinian factions.\n\nWang said the agreement was \"dedicated to the great reconciliation and unity of all 14 factions\".\n\nThe top Chinese diplomat noted that \"an agreement has been reached on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government\".\n\nHamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook highlighted the role of unity among Palestinians.\n\nThe singing of the deal, however, infuriated Israel.\n\nIsrael's postwar plots\n\nAccording to a document that was leaked weeks after October 7, the Israeli Intelligence Ministry had called on the regime's army to evacuate the civilian population to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.\n\nNetanyahu and his far-right ministers supported the mass expulsion of the Palestinians.\n\nThe Israeli regime is opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza after the war ends. Tel Aviv has also rejected calls from the administration of US President Joe Biden for the Palestinian Authority (PA) to run Gaza.\n\nPA remains unpopular\n\nFatah dominates both the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA). It is the interim Palestinian government established in the West Bank after the signing of the 1993 agreement known as the Oslo Accords.\n\nThe PA held administrative control over Gaza until 2007. But Hamas has ruled Gaza since then, a year after winning the 2006 legislative elections.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been bitter rivals since the latter won the 2006 elections.\n\nPalestinians view the PA as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nThe Palestinian public also believe that the PA, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, is unable to provide security in the face of regular Israeli incursions into the occupied West Bank.\n\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in December last year, more than 60% of Palestinians want the PA to be dissolved.

No timetable was declared for implementation.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout.\n\nThe meeting marked the latest attempt to heal the Palestinian national schism that has defied all attempts at mediation since 2007, when the Islamist group Hamas seized the Gaza Strip in a brief civil war with Fatah.\n\nThe meeting was held amid attempts by mediators to reach a ceasefire deal after nine months of war between Israel and Hamas inGaza. One of the sticking points is the \"day-after\" plan - how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war, which began on Oct. 7, ends.\n\nHamas welcomed the declaration, saying it created a \"barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests\".\n\nBut there was no immediate comment from the Fatah movement led by President Mahmoud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In March, Abbas appointed a new Palestinian Authority (PA) government led by one of his allies, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nIsrael signalled its objection, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz saying on X that Abbas had embraced \"the murderers and rapists of Hamas\" instead of \"rejecting terrorism\".\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Katz said.\n\nShunned by the West as a terrorist group even before Oct. 7, Hamas has previously said it might be willing to play no role in Gaza's post-war governance and has sought agreement with Fatah on a post-war, technocratic PA government.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy the militant, Iran-backed Hamas and opposes it having any part in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\nNetanyahu's right-wing government, which rejects Palestinians' quest for an independent state, has also objected to a revamped PA returning to govern Gaza - an idea supported by the United States and its Arab allies.\n\nThe most prominent highlight in the deal was a plan to form an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza as well as of the West Bank, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the unity government would also oversee reconstruction and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs and managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happen without U.S. approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\nDismissing the China meeting as \"a celebratory event\", he said it was\"impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days\".\n\nNonetheless, the agreement further demonstrates Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors":

The US and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it recognises Israel - a hurdle that has wrecked past efforts.\n\n\"There is an opportunity - but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masri, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages into its tenth month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed ceasefire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nIt follows talks led by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.\n\n\"The core outcome is that the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people,\" Mr Wang said.\n\nThe PLO is an internationally recognised coalition of parties that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993 and holds a permanent observer seat at the United Nations. Fatah dominates both the PLO and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHamas is not currently a part of the PLO and it was unclear what role it would play under the new agreement. Hamas and Fatah have a long history of animosity since Hamas fighters removed their Fatah counterparts from the Gaza Strip.\n\nHamas representative Mousa Abu Marzouk used the platform in Beijing to speak about the deadly 7 October terrorist attack on Israel and said their actions \"changed a lot, both in international and regional landscape\".\n\n\"Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,\" Mr Abu Marzouk said, according to a translated transcript by the Chinese foreign ministry.\n\nMr Wang added that the \"most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government\" for the governance of post-war Gaza.\n\nHe said China was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nChina, which has denounced the Benjamin Netanyahu government for its attacks on the Gaza Strip, ostensibly aimed at eradicating Hamas, has sought to present itself as a peacemaker as it seeks to become the leading voice of countries in the global South.\n\nChina has called for Palestinian statehood and has refrained from explicitly condemning Hamas for the attack.\n\nIn May, president Xi Jinping lamented \"tremendous sufferings\" in Gaza and said Israel's war in the region \"should not continue indefinitely\" and \"justice should not be absent forever\". His remarks came during a gathering of Arab leaders at the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese government has also backed the Palestinian cause by providing emergency humanitarian assistance during the crisis and for the post-war rebuilding in Gaza.\n\nIt comes as the Israeli prime minister told the families of hostages held in Gaza that a deal to secure their loved ones' release could be nearing.\n\n\"The conditions are undoubtedly ripening. This is a good sign,\" Mr Netanyahu told the families on Monday in Washington, where was expected to meet US president Joe Biden later this week after making an address to Congress.\n\nUS secretary of

Wang Yi, China's foreign minister, hailed the agreement as \"dedicated to the great reconciliation and unity of all 14 factions,\" claiming that \"an agreement has been reached on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government.\"\n\nThe exact role in a national unity government of Hamas -- the Iranian-backed terrorist organization that ousted Fatah from Gaza during a brutal civil war in 2007 -- remains unclear. Wang declared that the \"core outcome is that the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people.\" Neither Hamas nor PIJ is a constituent group of the PLO. According to the Israeli news outlet Globes, \"the subject of a Palestinian unity government has been mentioned only by Chinese reports, and not by any senior representatives of Fatah or Hamas.\" Fatah was represented by Mahmoud al-Aloul, deputy to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, while the Hamas delegation was led by Mousa Abu Marzouk, a veteran Hamas leader who was listed as a \"Specially Designated Terrorist\" by the U.S Treasury Department in 1995. The factions gathered in Beijing have all been involved in terrorist attacks targeting Israel, with PIJ issuing a statement following the talks disputing that an agreement had been reached and insisting that it would not be party to a formula that recognized Israel \"explicitly or implicitly,\" the pro-Iranian Lebanese outlet Al-Mayadeen reported. Separately, Al-Ain media in the UAE reported that the talks in China face hurdles because they do not offer a timetable for a new interim Palestinian government to be formed with Hamas and Fatah as likely participants.\n\n\"Hamas has sought to leverage the October 7 attack on Israel to increase its power in the West Bank, using its war against Israel as a battering ram to achieve power in Ramallah and replacing the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority. China is helping to pave the way through the talks in Beijing. Hamas hopes that countries such as China, Turkey, Russia, and Iran will help in the achievement of its goal of achieving its dream of taking over Palestinian institutions, presenting Israel with more terror threats from multiple fronts.\" -- Seth J. Frantzman, FDD Adjunct Fellow\n\n\"This week's Beijing-brokered reconciliation talks, while noteworthy, appear to be more about style than substance. In hosting Hamas representatives in Beijing, China runs the risk of being perceived as legitimizing the terrorist group at a time when it is fighting for its survival. Such a risky diplomatic gambit could have unforeseen repercussions on China's credibility, potentially undermining its efforts to be seen as a responsible global stakeholder.\" -- Craig Singleton, FDD Senior Fellow and Senior Director of FDD's China Program\n\nThe meeting in Beijing follows Russia's hosting of unity talks between Fatah and Hamas in March, which failed to result in an agreement. The talks in Beijing, if successful, would end 17 years of division between Hamas-run Gaza and the Palestinian Authority-run West Bank. In the wake of its October 7 massacre in southern Israel, Hamas has seen its popularity increase among Palestinians.", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"}, "authors":

This lays the foundation for unity and stability within Palestine, Ding told the Global Times.\n\nIn recent years, the international community has become pessimistic about any resolution to the Palestinian issue. \"External countries were unenthusiastic, so were Arab countries, and even within Palestine, there was little hope,\" said Ding. \"It highlighted China's tremendous political courage and diplomatic efforts in getting them to sit together this time for a chat.\"\n\nZhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the Beijing Declaration is pointing a direction and offering guidelines, rather than an executive manual.\n\nExperts suggested that the timing of such unity reflects that intra-Palestinian factions have decided to adopt a more practical attitude about internal rifts and the establishment of an independent Palestine state.\n\nDespite wide recognition from the international community on this major reconciliation progress, some Western media and politicians have not given up on speaking ill of the development.\n\nReuters on Tuesday cited analysts saying the agreement would \"prove hard to implement,\" with complications including the deep enmity between Palestinian factions and Western opposition to Hamas having any role in governance.\n\nResponding to such \"concerns,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the latest development has \"brought hope and a future to the Palestinian people.\" Only by continuously consolidating consensus and putting it into practice can the reconciliation process become more concrete, and internal unity stronger.\n\n\"Peace will not be accomplished overnight, but as long as the effort is in the right direction, we must keep at it and never lose faith,\" Mao noted. China will continue to support the Palestinian people in restoring their legitimate national rights and support the people of countries in the Middle East in controlling their own destiny, the spokesperson added.\n\nAccording to the AP, Israel said it rejects Hamas' involvement in the governance of Gaza after the war.\n\nHamas previously said it might be willing to play no role in Gaza's post-war governance and has sought agreement with Fatah on a post-war, technocratic Palestinian Authority government, media reported.\n\nZhu said rejection of Hamas in a post-war government may be more of an excuse to oppose the reconciliation itself.\n\nIsrael has also rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own, the AP reported.\n\nAs the U.S. is having a strategic contraction in the Middle East and its response to the nine-month Gaza conflict has disappointed and angered many Muslims, China's mediation seems \"ever more precious,\" Zhu said. \"The U.S., which does not have the ability to offer such a negotiation platform, does not have the right to point fingers at China,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ecns.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China News \u4e2d\u56fd\u65b0\u95fb\u7f51"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The agreement came through in Beijing after three days of negotiations moderated by China.\n\nIt's yet another attempt at resolving a years-long rivalry between the two groups that has cast a shadow on options to rule Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn light of these dark times, \"there needs to be unity,\" said Issam Bakr, from the West Bank, in a video shared with CBC News. Bakr is a member of the political bureau of the socalist Palestinian People's Party.\n\nThe declaration comes at a tense time, as the war in Gaza stretches into its 10th month and Israel and Hamas weigh a U.S.-Egypt backed ceasefire proposal that would see the war end and release the remaining hostages held by Hamas.\n\nThe two groups issued a joint statement announcing the deal, but provided no details on its implementation, or when the government would be formed. Similar declarations have previously failed, leading to doubts about the legitimacy of the move. In the announcement, both sides said this was only an \"initial step.\"\n\n\"There is an opportunity, but it's not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs, told The Associated Press.\n\nBakr hopes the decision will translate to real changes on the ground.\n\n\"I hope the announcement creates a state of geopolitical unity between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and ends the split through legitimate and serious steps.\"\n\nHamas was elected in Gaza in 2006. Fatah had been the ruling party before then; today, it controls parts of the occupied West Bank through the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe two groups have been at odds since that election, as Hamas believes in armed resistance against Israel, while Fatah believes in peaceful negotiation.\n\nHamas within Gaza is currently led by Yahya Sinwar, who's thought to be the mastermind behind the attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Fatah, meanwhile, is led by Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian state.\n\nFatah was co-founded in the 1950s by then-leader Yasser Arafat. Formally known as the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, the party began seeking a two-state solution with Israel in the 1980s and has since encouraged diplomatic ways to deal with the conflict.\n\nRamzi Rabah, member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), called the announcement a \"positive move.\" The PLO is a political group that aims to represent Palestinians worldwide. Formed in 1964, it looks to centralize Palestinian groups that operated as separate movements at the time.\n\n\"The national decision in China came to agreements that created an advanced step on the path to restoring unity [between political groups],\" Rabah said.\n\nIsrael and the U.S. both denounced the pact. The United States has refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas, unless the group also recognizes Israel. This has been a thorn in previous attempts to unite Palestinian groups, in addition to infighting among them.\n\nIn a post on X, Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the agreement \"won't happen.\"\n\nHe criticized Abbas for \"embracing the murders and rapists of Hamas\" and \"revealing his true face.\" He said the agreement would fall through \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed.\"\n\n\"Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" he said.\n\nIsrael opposes any role in governing for Hamas, which it vowed to destroy after the group led the Oct. 7 attacks that left 1,200 dead and over 200 hostages taken into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's responding ground and air offensive has left 39,000 dead, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nIsrael has also rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the war ends.\n\nHamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling the Gaza Strip and advocates for forming a government that would be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions. Afterwards, that government would prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank with the intention of forming a unified government to lead both parts of the Palestinian territories.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible ceasefire,\" Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson, told The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_People's_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Abbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yasser Arafat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7272803.1721765800!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/china-palestinians.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2003, "textEnd": 2009, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Sadly, not far", "body": "LONDON/BEIJING - More than a dozen Palestinian factions, including bitter rivals Fatah and Hamas, signed a joint declaration in Beijing on July 23, vowing to form an interim unity government that will govern all the occupied Palestinian lands once the fighting in Gaza stops.\n\nThe deal has been hailed by Beijing as a decisive step in ending the war in Gaza.\n\nForeign Minister Wang Yi described the agreement, dubbed the Beijing Declaration, as a \"historic moment for the cause of Palestine's liberation\", while state news agency Xinhua presented the deal as a \"vivid manifestation of China's concrete actions to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind\".\n\nThere is no question that brokering the Palestinian agreement will boost China's international standing.\n\nHowever, there are serious doubts about the deal's practical implications for the fighting in Gaza or the broader power balance in the Middle East.\n\nAlthough Chinese officials present the agreement they brokered as a great diplomatic breakthrough, the truth is that every few years, representatives of Hamas and Fatah - the leading proponents of the Palestinian cause - meet, sign a reconciliation agreement, and then promptly return to fighting each other.\n\nUntil recently, everything pointed to more confrontation. Hamas in Gaza continued to fight alone against Israel, while the secular Fatah of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas hunted down its Islamist Hamas rivals in the West Bank.\n\nStill, the Chinese intervention was perfectly timed.\n\nFatah's control over the West Bank is increasingly tenuous, as the Israeli government defies both world public opinion and the advisory rulings of the International Court of Justice and continues to expand illegal Jewish settlements.\n\nAnd although it has not been defeated, Hamas is struggling to retain control in Gaza.\n\nThe agreement brokered by China aims to compensate for the weakness of the two Palestinian bodies. It also emphasises the role of the Fatah-dominated Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the umbrella body for all the Palestinian factions, as the sole representative of the Palestinian nation.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration, therefore, addresses a key question plaguing international efforts to stop the bloodshed in Gaza: Who will govern Gaza after a ceasefire is in place?\n\nSadly, the deal changes nothing.\n\nMany Fatah leaders, including people close to President Abbas, suspect that Hamas - which evicted Fatah from Gaza in 2007 by slaughtering many Fatah officials - will never relinquish its control of Gaza and only wants Fatah's involvement as a political cover for Hamas' continued rule.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_eyal@straitstimes.com", "name": "Jonathan Eyal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tan_dawn_wei@straitstimes.com", "name": "Tan Dawn Wei", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_State_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the State of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Abbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/07/25/11492246.jpg?VersionId=BGF_jCLrnfg3HhnKHTyQAGeuL95o4b3G", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 139, "textEnd": 146}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The country announced Tuesday that it had successfully mediated between Hamas and Fatah, two Palestinian groups, on a \"national reconciliation\" deal for post-war Gaza.\n\nThis quickly angered Israel. In its latest update on Wednesday (24/7/2024), Tel Aviv quickly condemned Beijing's deal.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz insisted that \"the Hamas government will be destroyed.\" He also accused Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas, whose Fatah faction signed the deal, of supporting the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that sparked the war.\n\n\"Abbas supports the murderers and murderers of Hamas,\" he said, published AFP.\n\n\"Abbas will only monitor Gaza from afar,\" he charged, once again rejecting the role of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.\n\nIn fact, Hamas' involvement in the post-war government of Gaza is unacceptable to Israel and the United States. Both consider it a terrorist group.\n\n\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently in the United States to address a joint session of Congress, has also vowed to continue the war in Gaza until Hamas is eliminated. Even though the war has been going on since October 2023 and has claimed the lives of nearly 39,000 civilians.\n\nChina hosted talks between senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk and Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and 12 other Palestinian factions. Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas's political bureau, described China's involvement as a way to counter American influence.\n\n\"The United States is biased,\" he said.\n\n\"The United States opposes the internal Palestinian national consensus as well as its partners in the (Israeli) occupation in its crimes against our people,\" he added.\n\nThe text of the Beijing agreement outlines plans to form a national unity government based on the agreement of the Palestinian factions that will exercise authority and power over the entire Palestinian territory. This includes the Gaza Strip as well as the West Bank, including the territories annexed by Israel. East Jerusalem.\n\nPlease note that Hamas and Fatah are rivals. The two were involved in a short and bloody war in 2007, when the Hamas group took control of Gaza.\n\nFatah dominates the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited administrative control over urban areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinian presidency, in a statement, welcomed China's support for an immediate ceasefire. Including Xi Jinping's aid flow to Gaza as well as its support for other Palestinian diplomatic efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli attacks continued. On the ground, Israel ordered civilians to evacuate parts of Khan Yunis, an area that has been declared a humanitarian security zone.\n\nTheir warplanes pounded the city on Monday. Gaza's health ministry said 73 people were killed and more than 200 wounded in the territory in the latest Israeli attacks.\n\nThe Israeli military was reluctant to provide information to journalists. But in a statement, the agency said its warplanes and tanks had attacked and eliminated terrorists in the area.\n\n\"Gaza is finished, Gaza is dead, Gaza is gone. There is nothing left, nothing,\" said Hassan Qudayh, a resident forced to flee.\n\nThe war has also destroyed the health system in Gaza. Hospitals are under enormous pressure.\n\n\"There is no place to accommodate more patients... There is a shortage of medical supplies, so we cannot save our patients,\" said the director of Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, Mohammed Zaqout.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType":

No timetable was declared for implementation.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout.\n\nThe meeting marked the latest attempt to heal the Palestinian national schism that has defied all attempts at mediation since 2007, when the Islamist group Hamas seized the Gaza Strip in a brief civil war with Fatah.\n\nThe meeting was held amid attempts by mediators to reach a ceasefire deal after nine months of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. One of the sticking points is the \"day-after\" plan - how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war, which began on Oct. 7, ends.\n\nHamas welcomed the declaration, saying it created a \"barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests\".\n\nBut there was no immediate comment from the Fatah movement led by President Mahmoud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In March, Abbas appointed a new Palestinian Authority (PA) government led by one of his allies, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nIsrael signalled its objection, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz saying on X that Abbas had embraced \"the murderers and rapists of Hamas\" instead of \"rejecting terrorism\".\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Katz said.\n\nShunned by the West as a terrorist group even before Oct. 7, Hamas has previously said it might be willing to play no role in Gaza's post-war governance and has sought agreement with Fatah on a post-war, technocratic PA government.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy the militant, Iran-backed Hamas and opposes it having any part in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\nNetanyahu's right-wing government, which rejects Palestinians' quest for an independent state, has also objected to a revamped PA returning to govern Gaza - an idea supported by the United States and its Arab allies.\n\nThe most prominent highlight in the deal was a plan to form an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza as well as of the West Bank, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the unity government would also oversee reconstruction and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs and managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happen without U.S. approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\nDismissing the China meeting as \"a celebratory event\", he said it was \"impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days\".\n\nNonetheless, the agreement further demonstrates Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news",

AP\n\nChina's Tuesday announcement of a unity government agreement between Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah has attracted global attention, with West Asia watchers doubting its actual outcome in the long run. The deal is meant to deliver a post-war Gaza administration but quickly rejected by Israel as it seeks to crush Hamas.\n\nThe deal, sealed at a dialogue in Beijing from July 21-23, aims to establish a post-war administration for Gaza. However, this ambitious diplomatic effort, dubbed the Beijing Declaration, faces immediate and formidable opposition from Israel, Western powers, and internal Palestinian divisions.\n\nThis follows China's 12-point plan for establishing peace in Europe, ending the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. China's peace plan, though backed by Russia, has not received much attention from the West, which is involved in the war with the Nato security group monitoring the situation and member nations supplying ammunition and funds to Ukraine as it fights the Russian forces after the February 2022 invasion.\n\nIn 2023, China brokered a deal between arch-rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, showing its intent to bid itself as a leading global power and an efficient mediator.\n\nCan the Beijing Declaration be really a new hope for unity in Palestine?\n\nSigned by representatives from 14 Palestinian groups, the Beijing Declaration represents China's latest attempt to mediate the long-standing rift between rival factions. The agreement proposes to form a national reconciliation government to govern both Gaza and the West Bank post-war.\n\nThis initiative follows numerous failed attempts to bridge the divide that has persisted since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 after a violent conflict with Fatah.\n\nHamas has welcomed the declaration, viewing it as a shield against external influences that conflict with Palestinian interests. Senior Hamas official Hussam Badran stated that the unity government would oversee Gaza's reconstruction and pave the way for elections. Yet, the absence of a specific timeline for implementation raises questions about the agreement's viability.\n\nChallenges and Scepticism\n\nAnalysts remain sceptical about the practical implementation of the Beijing Declaration. The deep-seated enmity between Hamas and Fatah is a significant hurdle.\n\nAdditionally, Western opposition to Hamas's participation in governance complicates the situation further. Commentators cited in media reports have said previous agreements had failed to materialise without U.S. approval. He dismissed the Beijing talks as a \"celebratory event\" unlikely to resolve the profound divisions in just three days.\n\nIsrael's response has been of unequivocal rejection. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz dismissed the agreement, accusing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of aligning with Hamas, which he labelled as terrorists. Following the October 7 attack on Israelis, the relations between the two has worsened as the consequent and ongoing war has killed thousands in Gaza, governed officially by Hamas.\n\nKatz asserted that Hamas would be defeated and that Israel's security would remain under its control. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed this stance, vowing to dismantle Hamas and opposing its involvement in Gaza's post-war governance.\n\nHow international community views China's growing influence\n\nThe international community's response has been mixed. The United States and its Arab allies have expressed support for a technocratic Palestinian Authority (PA) government to administer Gaza, excluding Hamas.\n\nConversely, China has been amplifying its advocacy for Palestinian causes in recent months. This mediation effort follows Beijing's successful brokering of a peace deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran last year, highlighting China's growing diplomatic influence in West Asia.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has emphasised that the agreement's most significant aspect was the formation of an interim national reconciliation government. This national unity government would not only manage Gaza's reconstruction but also prepare conditions for future elections. However, the road ahead is fraught with obstacles, given the historical and political complexities.\n\nDoes history make us wise?\n\nThe Palestinian national schism traces back to the early 2000s, with attempts at reconciliation thwarted by ideological differences and external pressures. The current conflict between Israel and Hamas, which erupted on October 7, has exacerbated the situation.\n\nMediators have been striving to secure a ceasefire, with the contentious issue of Gaza's governance post-conflict being a significant sticking point. Some reports have trashed the China-brokered peace deal as a rehash of several previous statements of reconciliation between the two principal rivals.\n\nIn one case, Algeria hosted 14 Palestinian factions as recently as 2022, getting them to sign an agreement. But none of those efforts has yielded any concrete movement in the Hamas-Fatah rift to date.\n\nHowever, in what came as a surprise move, Hamas has shown willingness to forgo a direct role in Gaza's post-war governance in China-mediated talks. It signals a potential shift in its strategy.\n\nBut Israel's determination to prevent any Hamas involvement poses a substantial barrier. Netanyahu's government, which firmly opposes Palestinian statehood, has consistently rejected the idea of a revitalised PA taking over Gaza.\n\nSo, what's in store for the Beijing Declaration?\n\nThe future of the Beijing Declaration remains uncertain. Implementing the agreement will require dealing with the intricate landscape of Palestinian politics and securing broader international acceptance amid a competition among several global powers to keep its hold on the region. The United States, Israel, and other key players' stance on excluding Hamas will be a critical factor to determine what future holds for the Beijing Declaration.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com",

PEDRO PARDO/Pool via REUTERS\n\nBy Laurie Chen and Nidal al-Mughrabi\n\nBEIJING/CAIRO (Reuters) - Palestinian rivals including Hamas and Fatah agreed to form a unity government at talks hosted by China, Beijing said on Tuesday, a deal meant to deliver a post-war Gaza administration but quickly rejected by Israel as it seeks to crush Hamas.\n\nAnalysts said the agreement would prove hard to implement, with complications including the deep enmity between Palestinian factions and Western opposition to Hamas having any role in governance. No timetable was declared for implementation.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout.\n\nThe meeting marked the latest attempt to heal the Palestinian national schism that has defied all attempts at mediation since 2007, when the Islamist group Hamas seized the Gaza Strip in a brief civil war with Fatah.\n\nThe meeting was held amid attempts by mediators to reach a ceasefire deal after nine months of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. One of the sticking points is the \"day-after\" plan - how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war, which began on Oct. 7, ends.\n\nHamas welcomed the declaration, saying it created a \"barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests\".\n\nBut there was no immediate comment from the Fatah movement led by President Mahmoud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In March, Abbas appointed a new Palestinian Authority (PA) government led by one of his allies, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nIsrael signalled its objection, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz saying on X that Abbas had embraced \"the murderers and rapists of Hamas\" instead of \"rejecting terrorism\".\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Katz said.\n\nShunned by the West as a terrorist group even before Oct. 7, Hamas has previously said it might be willing to play no role in Gaza's post-war governance and has sought agreement with Fatah on a post-war, technocratic PA government.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy the militant, Iran-backed Hamas and opposes it having any part in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\nNetanyahu's right-wing government, which rejects Palestinians' quest for an independent state, has also objected to a revamped PA returning to govern Gaza - an idea supported by the United States and its Arab allies.\n\nThe most prominent highlight in the deal was a plan to form an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza as well as of the West Bank, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the unity government would also oversee reconstruction and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs and managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happen without U.S. approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\nDismissing the China meeting as \"a celebratory event\", he said it was \"impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days\".\n\nNonetheless, the agreement further demonstrates Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.\n\n(Reporting by Liz Lee, Ethan Wang and Beijing newsroom,

Not too long ago, there was the Moscow statement,\" he added, speaking of previous mediation efforts. Russia has hosted a number of talks among Palestinian factions in Moscow, most recently this February.\n\nCrucially, the Beijing Declaration lacks any description of an implementation mechanism to turn its pledges into a reality, Elgindy said. An unnamed senior Fatah official told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that the deal had largely been signed out of respect for their Chinese hosts.\n\nRegional experts said China was likely using the talks to bolster its diplomatic credentials as it increasingly seeks to rival the United States on the world stage.\n\n\"I think this is a quest for a cheap diplomatic reputation, optics mostly, enabling China to portray itself as a significant power broker in the Middle East, which used to be the realm of the U.S.,\" said Assaf Orion, the director of the Israel-China program at the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank.\n\nBeijing has long-standing ties to the Palestinians, and in 1988, China became one of the first countries in the world to recognize a Palestinian state. In June 2023, China signed a strategic partnership agreement with the PA in Beijing, where Abbas met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nChina's diplomatic push for Palestinian unity also sends a powerful message to countries in the global south and across the Islamic world, where there has been a strong backlash against Israel's punishing military campaign in Gaza, said Ahmed Aboudouh, an expert on China's rising influence in the Middle East at Chatham House, as Beijing seeks to position itself as an alternative to the Western-led order in an increasingly multipolar world.\n\nBut no one in Israel is seriously considering China as a mediator, Orion said.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz condemned the agreement in a statement on X. \"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas,\" he said. \"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar.\" Washington has historically provided the backbone for diplomatic efforts between the Israelis and Palestinians and is party to the ongoing efforts with Qatar and Egypt to broker a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas and secure the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza.\n\nChina's attempt to secure a deal among the Palestinian factions, on the other hand, speaks to Beijing's approach to high-stakes crises, in which it narrows in on a subsection of the crisis. \"China plays a very crucial role in small initiatives to hand it over to the United Nations and to sideline the United States,\" Aboudouh said.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was also in Beijing on Tuesday to discuss paths to end the war with Russia, in his first visit to China since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.\n\nWhile few breakthroughs are expected as a result of the recent talks in Beijing involving the Palestinian factions, political rapprochement between Hamas and Fatah will be critical for effective governance in Gaza after the war, Elgindy said. With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set on eradicating Hamas after its attack on Oct. 7, 2023, the United States has viewed the Fatah-dominated PA as the best candidate to fill the power vacuum in the strip after the fighting ends -- a proposal that Netanyahu has adamantly rejected.\n\nBut although the war has significantly diminished Hamas's military and governing capabilities, U.S. officials and experts are skeptical that the group and its ideology can be fully eradicated. That raises the possibility that, without some kind of detente agreed between the two groups, Hamas could continue to play spoiler in Gaza, should the PA return to govern the strip.\n\n\"There's no way for the PA to return to Gaza and be able to function without Hamas's acquiescence at a minimum,\" Elgindy said. \"Even if they're not in government, they have the ability to disrupt.\"", "source":

It also recognizes the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the \"sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe PLO was founded in 1964 as an umbrella organization advancing the goal of Palestinian statehood. Fatah has long stayed at the helm of both the PLO and the Palestinian Authority, which now administers part of the West Bank.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO. The Iran-backed terrorist group has a record of refusing to share power, including in 2007, when Hamas routed Fatah and seized control of Gaza after winning a majority of seats in the previous year's elections.\n\nIsrael criticized Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas for seeking to co-govern Gaza with Hamas, which ignited the current war on Oct. 7, 2023, with an unprecedented invasion of southern Israel.\n\nSince last October's terrorist attack, Israel has stood by its goal to uproot Hamas from Gaza and has resisted the suggestion that Hamas be given any role in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\nReacting to Beijing's endorsement of a Palestinian government that includes Hamas, Mr. Katz dismissed such an idea as unrealistic, saying that when the war ends, there will be no Hamas left to make a joint government with.\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar,\" he wrote. \"Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nThe declaration comes as Israel and Hamas continue to negotiate a deal that would see the end of fighting in Gaza, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and the safe return of all the remaining Israeli hostages.\n\nDuring the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas terrorists launched a spree of killing and kidnapping of Israeli civilians, leaving some 1,200 people dead and 251 taken as hostages.\n\nLast year, Iranian and Saudi Arabian officials met in Beijing and signed a deal to resume diplomatic relations between the two Gulf countries. The Saudi-Iranian deal is seen as the CCP's attempt to achieve parity with the U.S.-facilitated Abraham Accords, which normalized ties between Israel and four Arab states.\n\nAs part of its global influence operation, the CCP has sought to forge closer ties with terrorist groups such as Hamas and the Taliban.\n\nIn the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the almost immediate takeover of the country by the Taliban in 2021, China was one of the few countries to have maintained a diplomatic mission in Kabul. In February, the CCP formally recognized a Taliban envoy as the Afghan ambassador to Beijing, the first in the world to do so since the terrorist group seized power.", "source": {"uri":

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who facilitated the meeting with senior representatives from Hamas, Fatah, and 12 other Palestinian groups, confirmed that the agreement involves the establishment of a \"transitional government of national reconciliation\" to manage Gaza post-war.\n\nHamas spokesman Mousa Abu Marzouk emphasized the commitment to national unity after the signing, stating, \"Today we signed an agreement on national unity and we declare that national unity is the way to end this journey. We are dedicated to it and call for it.\"\n\nHamas, established in the 1980s, became a significant opposition to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), with Fatah being the leading faction within the PLO. The primary distinction between Hamas and Fatah lies in their approach to Israel: Hamas seeks the destruction of Israel, while Fatah aims to establish a Palestinian state without altering Israel's status.\n\nTensions between Hamas and Fatah intensified in 2006 when Hamas secured a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council elections, which had previously been dominated by Fatah. This resulted in a brief military conflict and a failed attempt at shared governance. By 2007, Hamas had taken control of the Gaza Strip, while Fatah retained authority over the West Bank.\n\nThis new agreement between the Palestinian factions and other organizations comes more than nine months after the onset of the war between Israel and Hamas. The conflict began with a surprise attack by Hamas on southern Israel, which resulted in approximately 1,200 deaths, primarily civilians, and around 250 hostages, with more than 110 still believed to be in Gaza. According to Hamas-controlled health authorities, nearly 40,000 people have died in the subsequent Israeli military response.", "source": {"uri": "novinite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Novinite.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Legislative_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Legislative Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2024-07/photo_verybig_227312.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

It called for the establishment of a unified government across Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem to bolster efforts to end the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, expel Israeli occupation from Palestinian territories and rebuild in the wake of the longest and deadliest flare-up of Israeli-Palestinian violence to date.\n\nThe move marks the latest attempt to mend the rift that first erupted when Hamas seized control of Gaza amid clashes with Fatah in 2007, a year after the Islamist group came out ahead in the last elections to be held by the West Bank-based and Fatah-led Palestinian National Authority (PA) and two years after Israel fully withdrew from decades of military rule over Gaza.\n\nPrevious efforts toward reconciliation have unraveled but the latest bid comes with the backing of China, which has demonstrated a greater focus on Middle East diplomacy with its successful brokering of a landmark agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia in March 2023.\n\nShen Shiwei, journalist and nonresident research fellow at Zhejiang Normal University's Institute of African Studies, called it \"a milestone for Palestinian and regional peace\" that contrasted from the approach of the United States, which has traditionally led peace efforts in the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\"From a historical perspective, the U.S. has definitely been a major influence in terms of bringing peace,\" Shen told Newsweek. \"But why have they failed again and again? One major reason is that some politicians on Capitol Hill don't want to make any impartial policies towards the region, which is why we have seen widespread campaigns against the U.S. and some Western countries' ignorance of the rights of Palestinian people.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the Chinese Embassy to the U.S., the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the U.S. State Department for comment.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz swiftly denounced the deal as well as PA President Mahmoud Abbas for endorsing it at a time when Netanyahu has vowed to deliver a decisive defeat to Hamas and expand Israel's control over Gaza.\n\n\"Hamas and Fatah signed an agreement in China for joint control of Gaza after the war,\" Katz wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nThe text of the joint Palestinian declaration reached in Beijing called for the formation of a \"temporary national consensus government\" that \"will exercise its powers and jurisdiction over all Palestinian territories in a way that confirms the unity of the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, provided that the government begins unifying all Palestinian institutions in the territory of the state.\"\n\nOther aspects of the agreement called for \"unifying national efforts to confront the Zionist aggression and stop the war of genocide carried out by the occupying state and herds of settlers with the support and participation of the United States of America,\" noting that this effort takes place \"under the umbrella and auspices of the United Nations and with broad international and regional participation as an alternative to unilateral and biased American sponsorship.\"\n\nFollowing the meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that \"the core outcome is the affirmation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people; the biggest highlight is the agreement on establishing an interim government of national reconciliation focusing on the post-conflict reconstruction of Gaza; and the strongest call is for truly establishing an independent State of Palestine in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions,\" according to a readout issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\nWhile Netanyahu has yet to release a comprehensive plan outlining the future of Gaza in the event of Hamas' defeat, a spokesperson for his office has previously told Newsweek that such a vision includes \"a demilitarized territory and a de-radicalized society, potentially run-by local civil administrators who have no link to terrorism.\"\n\nThe plan would also, \"for the foreseeable future,\" see Israel \"maintain some security responsibility over the Gaza Strip to make sure that we don't see a resurgence of terrorism,\" the spokesperson said at the time.\n\nThe White House, however, has called for a return to PA rule over Gaza and, as of May, has sought to implement a three-phase road map for ceasefire, the exchange of prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the reconstruction of Gaza. The deal was initially welcomed by Hamas but conflicting narratives over its contents have emerged in recent months, and talks taking place in Cairo have yet to achieve a breakthrough.\n\nResponding to questions regarding the agreement at a press briefing Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he had not yet reviewed the text of declaration but asserted that it was the Biden administration's position that \"Hamas is a terrorist organization\" and, therefore, \"there can't be a role\" for the group in post-conflict Gaza.\n\nThough Hamas did acknowledge the PLO, the coalition of largely secular and left-wing Palestinian factions that is led by Fatah and does not include Hamas, as \"the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\" as part of the agreement, Miller argued that Hamas had yet to truly \"accept the principles\" of the PLO as Hamas \"has not renounced terrorism, it has not renounced the use of violence to achieve its political aims, it has not renounced the destruction of the State of Israel.\"\n\nBut citing Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Miller said that China did have the potential to play a \"constructive role\" in the Middle East, and that the Biden administration has \"encouraged\" China to \"use their influence with countries in the region, especially countries with whom they have a relationship with,\" particularly Iran.\n\nUltimately, Miller argued that the declaration was unlikely to influence the ongoing negotiations in Egypt toward the U.S.-backed plan.\n\n\"We don't think anything related to this declaration should in any way have an impact on the ongoing discussions to reach a ceasefire,\" Miller said. \"We think it's an agreement is in sight. It's achievable. It doesn't mean we'll get there, but we have made progress in the talks.\"\n\nBut in the absence of palpable movement under the U.S.-led initiative, Shen saw an opportunity for China to step in, as well as the potential pitfalls in doing so given past failures following summits held in Algeria, Egypt, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen over the years.\n\n\"How can China navigate this sensitive issue? One reason is that China has upheld the principle of 'Palestinians governing Palestine' in pushing peace efforts in recent years,\" Shen said. \"The other important one is to listen to the demands and concerns of relevant parties, which is essential for an impartial reconciliation since regional affairs are very complicated and sensitive.\"\n\n\"In the past months, China has sent veteran envoys to the region for shuttle diplomacy to have more in-depth talks with parties of concern based on mutual respect,\" he added. \"That's why Fatah and Hamas held talks on promoting intra-Palestinian reconciliation in Beijing at the end of April. And that has paved a solid foundation for the latest reconciliation achievements.\"\n\nShen pointed out that China enlisted a broad coalition of stakeholders to attend the meeting as well, including top diplomats and senior representatives from Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Qatar, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Syria.\n\nBeijing, which oversees the world's largest diplomatic network, also brings its own heavy geopolitical and economic weight to the negotiating table. China has a long history of backing Palestinian factions in their fight for statehood dating back to the early days of the Cold War, but this stance shifted toward the end of the century and the People's Republic began establishing more robust relations with Israel after establishing formal diplomatic ties in 1992.\n\nThe two nations announced their \"innovative comprehensive partnership\" in 2017, but ties between China and Israel have once again hit serious snags with Beijing's inroads to Hamas and growing ties with Iran, whose allied Axis of Resistance coalition has unleashed daily attacks against Israel since the beginning of the war in Gaza in October.\n\nThe latest step, formally called the \"Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity,\" envisions its own three-step process toward resolving the conflict. The first calls for an immediate ceasefire along with an accelerated flow of humanitarian in Gaza, the second paves the way for the establishment of joint Palestinian governance in Gaza and the third marks a path for full Palestinian membership in the United Nations.\n\nShen called it \"a major step forward,\" though he acknowledged \"it's definitely not an easy job to achieve a long-lasting peace.\" Such an endeavor, he noted, still requires \"a lot of work.\"\n\nKhaled Elgindy, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and former PA negotiator, argued that \"China, of course, is trying to position itself as a major political player in the region, especially as the intra-Palestinian files is not something Washington can or would take on.\"\n\nBut he also expressed some skepticism toward the hopes for progress outlined in the document.\n\n\"Sadly, I don't think there is much new in this latest declaration from Beijing,\" Elgindy told Newsweek. \"Given the unprecedented, even existential, threats Palestinians are facing in both Gaza and the West Bank, there is an urgent need for a unitary and coherent political leadership.\"\n\n\"Both Hamas and Fateh understand this and need to project progress on the domestic reconciliation front, but what came out of Beijing is mostly a reiteration of previous principles,\" he added. \"There is general agreement (and has been for some time) on the need for a national consensus government, restructuring the PLO, Gaza reconstruction, etc., but there is no agreement on the details or on the exact steps for implementation.\"\n\nThe problem is partially rooted in the uncertainty that the future of 88-year-old Abbas and PA leadership face amid a historic legitimacy crisis exacerbated by the front-line role of Hamas and other factions in the war in Gaza, growing Israeli military and settler activity across the West Bank and frequent accusations of corruption. Polls continue to show that Hamas overwhelmingly outranks Fatah in terms of popularity.\n\nIn addition to Hamas and Fatah, other groups in attendance at the Beijing meeting included the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Palestinian People's Party, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, Palestinian National Initiative, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command, the Palestinian Democratic Union, the Palestinian Liberation Front, the Arab Liberation Front, the Palestinian Arab Front and Al-Saiqa.\n\nWith the Hamas-led war effort drawing increasing support among Palestinians despite condemnation from Israel and the U.S., a shift could see Abbas further isolated.\n\n\"Abbas in particular is not in a hurry to move ahead with reconciliation, both because he does not want to share power with Hamas and because doing so would likely invite direct retaliation from Israel and probably Congress as well,\" Elgindy said. \"The sad reality is that, as long Abbas is alive, I doubt we will see any real progress on the reconciliation front.\"",

The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.\n\nRecently, the Chinese government hosted representatives of 14 Palestinian factions, including senior Hamas and Fatah officials in Beijing. They pledged to end their divisions and strengthen Palestinian unity by signing the Beijing Declaration. From the perspective of international peace and regional security, the Chinese government is trying to bridge the differences between rival Palestinian factions that have long competed for power in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nFor the past 17 years, the United Nations and countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Switzerland and China have been trying to bridge the sharp, tangled divide between the two Palestinian political and strategic factions, Hamas and Fatah. While those attempts resulted in agreements and public statements from both sides, reconciliation has seemed elusive since violence broke out between the two rival factions in 2007, culminating in Hamas's bloody takeover of the Gaza Strip. As Israel and Hamas make progress on a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, discussions about the future of the \"enclave\" have become more urgent.\n\nAt the meeting in China, all Palestinian factions agreed to achieve comprehensive Palestinian national unity, including all Palestinian forces and factions within the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and are committed to establishing an independent Palestinian state in accordance with United Nations resolutions. They are also committed to ensuring that Palestine is protected in accordance with Resolution 194 of the United Nations General Assembly which includes the right of people to return to Palestine.\n\nParticipants also agreed that the Palestinian people have the right to resist the occupation and end it in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations. They decided to issue a decree by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in accordance with Palestine's Basic Law to form an interim national unity government based on the consensus of all Palestinian factions.", "source": {"uri": "news.cgtn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.cgtn.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score":

Fatah governs in the West Bank and previous attempts to end the faction fighting have proved elusive.\n\nThe Chinese-facilitated new accord known as the Beijing Declaration involved 14 different Palestinian groups, and a joint statement from Fatah and Hamas announcing the deal, as a prelude to a new unified government, reportedly provides no timetable or details on implementation.\n\nCall for more dialogue\n\n\"The Secretary-General encourages all factions to overcome their differences through dialogue and urges them to follow up on the commitments that were made in Beijing and the Declaration they signed on to\", said Mr. Dujarric.\n\n\"We've seen this before, we've talked about it before, and I think all steps towards unity are to be welcomed and encouraged. Palestinian unity, as we've said many a time, is crucial for peace and security and for advancing the aspirations of the Palestinian people for self-determination and for a fully independent, democratic, contiguous, viable and sovereign Palestinian State\", he added.\n\nMr. Guterres expressed his appreciation for the diplomatic efforts being made by China \"as well as efforts of other countries involved in facilitating the process.\"\n\nTwo States\n\nThe UN is committed to working towards a comprehensive two-State solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict with secure, recognized borders on the basis of pre-1967 lines which would have Jerusalem as the capital of both States, in line with UN resolutions and international law.\n\nThe United States and other Western nations have refused to recognize any Palestinian Government that includes Hamas representatives without express recognition of the State of Israel.

The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.\n\nThe complex and multifaceted nature of Palestinian politics has deep historical roots, which have led to the current proliferation of factions.\n\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), founded in Jerusalem in May 1964, is widely recognized as the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people. This recognition was solidified in October 1974 during the seventh Arab Summit. Fatah, the largest and most influential party within the PLO, was officially established in 1965.\n\nInitially advocating for armed struggle to liberate Palestinian territories, Fatah, under Yasser Arafat's leadership until his death in 2004, gradually adopted a more moderate and pragmatic stance, advocating for the recognition of Israel and seeking a peaceful resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on the land-for-peace formula. Mahmoud Abbas succeeded Arafat as the chairman of the PLO Executive Committee.\n\nIn contrast, Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, emerged in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip in the 1980s and was formally established in 1987. Hamas has consistently rejected the existence of Israel and has pursued the establishment of a Palestinian state on all territories occupied by Israel through armed struggle. Despite the Oslo Accords signed in 1993 between Israel and the PLO, which initiated the process of Palestinian self-governance in Gaza and the West Bank, Hamas has never recognized these accords. In January 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections and took power. By 2007, Hamas had expelled Fatah forces from Gaza, resulting in a divided Palestinian polity with Hamas controlling Gaza and Fatah governing the West Bank.\n\nThe recent reconciliation talks in Beijing included 12 other factions, most of which were established in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite their differing political views and activities, often conducted outside Palestinian territories, the majority of these groups recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe signing of the Beijing Declaration by these factions is a significant development with potential implications for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the broader Middle East peace process. Firstly, the international community's acknowledgment of the declaration underscores the Palestinian people's urgent desire to establish an independent state. This unified stance can help galvanize international support for Palestinian statehood, potentially leading to Palestine's formal membership in the United Nations and enhancing its global standing.\n\nSecondly, the Beijing Declaration addresses the urgent need to halt the Gaza conflict through a three-step road map, emphasizing increased humanitarian aid to Palestine and promoting negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. This approach aims to create the necessary conditions for Gaza's post-conflict reconstruction.\n\nMoreover, the declaration sends a clear message to Israel and its closest ally, the United States, highlighting China's peace efforts and the broad international support, including from Arab states, the UN and the EU, for the Palestinian cause. It urges the U.S. and Israel to take effective measures to alleviate the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and accelerate negotiations with Palestinian representatives to secure the release of hostages - a goal shared by both nations.\n\nIn the context of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the U.S., the declaration will pile pressure on Israel's military operation in Gaza. While the U.S. and other Western countries might cast doubt on the feasibility of the consensus reached by the Palestinian factions, Arab countries should greet it with a positive attitude.\n\nIn the event of a ceasefire in Gaza, the international community should swiftly initiate a more inclusive and representative new round of Middle East peace negotiations. The Beijing Declaration could thus play a crucial role in facilitating future peace efforts in the region.", "source": {"uri": "news.cgtn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.cgtn.com"},

signing of a declaration in Beijing by representatives of Palestinian factions has been broadly hailed as an \"exceptional success\" in China's diplomatic efforts to create conditions for ending the protracted conflict in the Gaza Strip and promoting regional peace.\n\nThe declaration on ending division and strengthening unity was signed on Tuesday after three days of reconciliation talks among 14 Palestinian factions, including rivals Hamas and Fatah.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \"very much welcomes\" the signing of the declaration by Palestinian factions, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in New York on Tuesday.\n\n\"The secretary-general encourages all factions to overcome their differences through dialogue and urges them to follow up on the commitments that were made in Beijing and the declaration they signed on to,\" Dujarric said.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas \"voiced profound appreciation of China's historical positions in support of the rights of the Palestinian people\", according to Palestine's WAFA News Agency.\n\nSven Koopmans, the European Union's special representative for the Middle East peace process, said that China has \"an important role in reconciliation based on the twostate solution and a halt to violence\".\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim wrote on social media platform X that the declaration signed in Beijing \"represents a promising step toward achieving Palestinian solidarity, so crucial for realizing the rights of the Palestinian people\".\n\nHe commended \"the government of the People's Republic of China for facilitating talks \"among Hamas, Fatah and 12 other Palestinian factions.\n\nAnwar said that international backing is essential for creating conditions for lasting peace in Gaza, and urged nations that have not yet voiced their support to recognize an independent State of Palestine and encourage such unity efforts.\n\n\"Malaysia stands ready to promote actively all measures toward that end,\" he added.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif wrote on X that he applauded China \"for securing this important diplomatic success\".\n\nThe world \"must stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people and urge Israel to end its brazen violence\", which has destroyed Gaza and killed around 40,000 innocent Palestinians in the past 10 months, Sharif said.\n\n\"Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and reiterates its call for a two-state solution that creates an independent State of Palestine with pre-1967 borders,\" he added.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry of Turkiye welcomed in a statement the gathering of Palestinian factions in Beijing and \"their acceptance of a declaration aimed at achieving national unity\", according to Turkiye's Anadolu Agency.\n\nWhile welcoming the declaration, the Sultanate of Oman said this \"highly needed goal\" should be achieved by adhering to \"relevant resolutions of international legitimacy\", according to the Oman News Agency.\n\nDina Yulianti Sulaeman, director of the Indonesia Center for Middle East Studies, told China Daily that the success of 14 Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, in reaching an agreement \"is due to China's impartial efforts\", which \"provide space for the Palestinian people to formulate what is best for them\".",

It also recognizes the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the \"sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe PLO was founded in 1964 as an umbrella organization advancing the goal of Palestinian statehood. Fatah has long stayed at the helm of both the PLO and the Palestinian Authority, which now administers part of the West Bank.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO. The Iran-backed terrorist group has a record of refusing to share power, including in 2007, when Hamas routed Fatah and seized control of Gaza after winning a majority of seats in the previous year's elections.\n\nIsrael criticized Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas for seeking to co-govern Gaza with Hamas, which ignited the current war on Oct. 7, 2023, with an unprecedented invasion of southern Israel.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on July 23.\n\nSince last October's terrorist attack, Israel has stood by its goal to uproot Hamas from Gaza and has resisted the suggestion that Hamas be given any role in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\nReacting to Beijing's endorsement of a Palestinian government that includes Hamas, Mr. Katz dismissed such an idea as unrealistic, saying that when the war ends, there will be no Hamas left to make a joint government with.\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar,\" he wrote. \"Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nThe declaration comes as Israel and Hamas continue to negotiate a deal that would see the end of fighting in Gaza, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and the safe return of all the remaining Israeli hostages.\n\nDuring the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas terrorists launched a spree of killing and kidnapping of Israeli civilians, leaving some 1,200 people dead and 251 taken as hostages.\n\nIt is believed that 120 hostages are still held in Gaza, including the bodies of more than 40 people confirmed dead by the Israeli military.\n\nThe declaration also marks another attempt by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to expand its diplomatic reach into the Middle East, positioning itself as an alternative to the United States in mediating conflicts.\n\nLast year, Iranian and Saudi Arabian officials met in Beijing and signed a deal to resume diplomatic relations between the two Gulf countries. The Saudi-Iranian deal is seen as the CCP's attempt to achieve parity with the U.S.-facilitated Abraham Accords, which normalized ties between Israel and four Arab states.\n\nAs part of its global influence operation, the CCP has sought to forge closer ties with terrorist groups such as Hamas and the Taliban.\n\nIn the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the almost immediate takeover of the country by the Taliban in 2021, China was one of the few countries to have maintained a diplomatic mission in Kabul. In February, the CCP formally recognized a Taliban envoy as the Afghan ambassador to Beijing, the first in the world to do so since the terrorist group seized power.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com",

The most prominent highlight was to agree to form a temporary national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza. The strongest appeal was to achieve a truly independent Palestinian state in accordance with relevant UN resolutions,\" Wang said.\n\nThe two major rivals, Fatah and Hamas, also signed the deal in an attempt to seal the divide that has existed since 2006. Hamas, which rules Gaza, and Fatah, which rules the West Bank, have been caught in a violent struggle to fully represent the Palestinian movement globally.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has rejected the reconciliation effort, saying the country's security \"will remain solely in Israel's hands\".\n\nAlso read: In a first, International Court of Justice calls Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory unlawful\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz said on X: \"Hamas and Fatah signed an agreement in China for joint control of Gaza after the war. Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nAbbas is the president of the State of Palestine and chairman of the PLO.\n\nChina's three-step plan\n\nAs a part of its mediation efforts, Beijing proposed a \"three-step approach\" to solve the \"current conflict dilemma\" in Palestine.\n\n\"The first step is to promote a comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible and ensure smooth access for humanitarian aid and relief... The second step is to uphold the principle of 'Palestinians governing Palestine' and work together to promote post-war governance in Gaza... The third step is to promote Palestine to become a full member of the United Nations and start implementing the 'two-state solution',\" explained Wang.\n\nApart from representatives from the 14 factions and China, there were other delegations from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Russia and Turkey.\n\nThis is the second effort by Beijing to bring together Palestinian factions after a summit in April failed to achieve a final consensus. The two rivals have in the past attempted to reunite, but have not been able to.\n\nIn the past few years, China has taken an active role as a mediator in West Asia. In March 2023, Beijing brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which led to the normalisation of relations between the two countries after ties were frozen in 2016. Riyadh and Tehran had found themselves on the opposing sides of the civil wars in Syria and Yemen.\n\nFatah-Hamas rivalry\n\nFatah is the most important faction of the PLO, which has been recognised as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people since 1974. Hamas, in comparison, has been designated a terrorist outfit by the US, the UK, the European Union (EU) and Israel.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won a majority in the legislative elections to the Palestinian National Authority -- a body formed in 1993 as a result of the Oslo Accords -- with 74 seats out of 132 seats. Fatah won only 45 seats.\n\nThe President of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, is from Fatah, and in 2006 he appointed Ismail Haniyeh, the current leader of Hamas, prime minister. However, the partnership quickly unravelled, with Hamas expelling Fatah officials from the Gaza strip in 2007. Haniyeh was dismissed by Abbas, leading to the fissure that has existed till date.\n\nFatah retained control of the West Bank, while Hamas remained in control of Gaza.\n\nThe current conflict was triggered by Hamas' attack on Israel last October, which killed about 1150 Israelis, while another 250 were taken as hostages. Israel retaliated with an offensive that has killed over 39,000 Palestinians and turned most of Gaza into rubble.\n\nAbout 120 hostages, alive or dead, remain with Hamas. Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that Tel Aviv and Hamas were close to finalising a ceasefire.\n\n(Edited by Tikli Basu)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news",

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Hamas envoy Musa Abu Marzuk said after Tuesday's signing ceremony.\n\nThe idea of a post-war government of technocrats for Gaza has been floated since the first months of the conflict triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attacks on Israel on October 7 last year.\n\n\"Informal meetings between Fatah and Hamas are taking place all the time,\" said Joost Hiltermann, Middle East director for the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe latest negotiations in China accomplished \"little to nothing\", he told AFP.\n\nTahini Mustafa, a senior Palestinian analyst for the ICG, said the deal should be seen in the context of recent moves by some European governments to recognise the State of Palestine.\n\n\"There is now a rising global momentum around Palestinian self-determination that the Palestinians themselves are not able to capitalise on because they're so divided amongst themselves,\" he said.\n\n- What are the obstacles? -\n\nHiltermann said determined Israeli opposition to any future role for Hamas was the most serious of an array of obstacles to the deal.\n\n\"An ideal deal would see Hamas enter the Palestine Liberation Organization in exchange for allowing the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza and oversee humanitarian aid and reconstruction,\" he said.\n\nThe PLO is an alliance of largely secular Palestinian factions historically regarded by the international community as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n\n\"Of course, there are many obstacles in the way of such a scenario, Israel being the main one,\" Hiltermann told AFP.\n\nHamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures, and Foreign Minister Israel Katz again pledged Tuesday that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\".\n\nGaza political analyst Mkhaimar Abusada criticised the \"vagueness\" of the accord's wording.\n\n\"For a Palestinian in Gaza... the agreement in Beijing is just another piece of paper,\" he said.\n\n\"There's the idea of reforming the PLO but there's no mention of how Hamas can be integrated into it.\"\n\nSome analysts questioned the genuineness of the rival factions' desire to work together, amid Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza that has killed at least 39,090 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\n\"The statement issued was not for the Palestinians; it was solely to please the Chinese friends,\" said analyst Jehad Harb.\n\n- What's in it for China? -\n\nHiltermann said China's dependence on imports of oil and gas from the region meant \"it has a stake in stability in the Middle East\".\n\nIt had a track record of fence-mending in the region, after brokering a surprise reconciliation deal between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia in March last year.\n\nQuentin Couvreur, a Chinese foreign policy researcher at Sciences Pos in Paris, said Beijing's main goal was to promote a political solution that cast Washington's dogged military support for Israel in an unfavourable light.\n\n\"The idea is to pose as a respectable, responsible superpower, and to denigrate the US,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a lot of rhetoric, it's a show of diplomacy ... but in the middle and long term, I'm more sceptical over whether it will solve the Israel-Palestine conflict.\"", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But the outlines of the agreement would see a Palestinian unity government being formed to oversee Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem with elections to be held as soon as possible.\n\nAlthough this implies acceptance of a two-state solution, both the United States and Israel have both rejected any role for Hamas.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz posted on X, formerly Twitter, \u201cthis won\u2019t happen because Hamas\u2019s rule will be crushed\u201d.\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman Mathew Miller said the Palestinian Authority should be the one \u201cgoverning a unified Gaza and West Bank\u201d.\n\nThe US is continuing to push for a ceasefire agreement that would see Hamas freeing all remaining hostages seized last October, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expected to visit the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe deal signed in Beijing is the latest attempt to bring rival Palestinian factions together, but none have been able to stick.\n\nA 2017 reconciliation deal signed by Hamas and Fatah in Cairo in 2017 under pressure from Arab states would have led to the creation of a unity government in Gaza, but it collapsed over a disagreement about who would control the borders.\n\nTo make matters worse, the following year the then Palestinian Authority prime minister Rami Hamdallah blamed Hamas for an assassination attempt against him during a visit to Gaza.\n\nNews portal Middle East Monitor reported that the Beijing agreement incorporated other previous deals, including the 2011 National Accord Agreement signed in Cairo and the 2022 Algeria Declaration, to be implemented \u201cwith the help of Egypt, Algeria, China and Russia\u201d.\n\nMa said previous failures were largely due to underrepresentation and the lack of a monitoring system to oversee implementation.\n\n\u201cOnly countries such as China and Russia can take care of the Palestinian cause in the framework of the United Nations and counteract the unfair US position against Palestine,\u201d he added.\n\nChina has been trying to promote its image as a peace broker after negotiating a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore diplomatic relations last year.\n\nBut Clemens Chay, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Middle East Institute, said that while the Iranians and Saudis had both given clear signals they were willing to engage with each other, \u201cthere are inherent differences, which are difficult to overcome\u201d among the rival Palestinian factions.\n\nThese include disagreements over whether to commit to non-violent means of securing statehood and how a post-war Palestinian state would be governed.\n\n\u201cI would say that Beijing managed to achieve a kind of lowest denominator from all factors and perhaps also dangling some carrots,\u201d Chay said.\n\n\u201cIn other words, some concessions for the parties involved. It\u2019s more symbolic than substantial.\u201d\n\nLooking forward, Chay said it would take a great deal of political capital on Beijing\u2019s part to hold the Palestinian factions to their word

Now, 14 Palestinian factions are gathering in Beijing with the greater good of their nation in mind.\n\n\"This is an important historical moment in the Palestinian liberation cause. China commends the reconciliation efforts made by all the factions, and congratulates them on the success of the Beijing dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration,\" Wang said.\n\nAt a daily news briefing on Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the declaration commends China's sincere effort to support the rights of the Palestinians, end division and bring about a unified position among the Palestinian factions. The declaration stresses the need to hold, under the auspices of the UN, an international conference with a full mandate and broad-based participation from the region and beyond.\n\nAccording to the declaration, parties believe that the Beijing talks demonstrated a positive and constructive spirit, and agree to realize national unity among all factions under the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, Mao said.\n\nThe declaration reaffirms commitment to establishing an independent State of Palestine with Jerusalem as the capital city based on relevant UN resolutions and ensuring the integrity of Palestinian territory including the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza. Parties are ready to, in line with the consensus of Palestinian factions and the existing basic law of Palestine, establish an interim national reconciliation government, carry out reconstruction in Gaza and prepare and hold a general election as soon as possible in accordance with the adopted election laws, according to Mao.\n\nParties stressed the need to take practical steps to form a new Palestinian national council in line with the adopted election laws. Parties unanimously agreed to activate the provisional Unified Leadership framework which will function institutionally, and jointly carry out political decision-making. Parties agreed to set up a collective mechanism to fully implement the provisions of the declaration and create a timetable for the implementation process, Mao added.\n\nPLO the sole legitimate representative of Palestinian people\n\nThe core outcome of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions held in Beijing is to specify that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people, Wang said.\n\nWang noted that the most important consensus reached at this dialogue is to achieve grand reconciliation and unity among the 14 factions, and the core outcome is to make clear that the PLO is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people.\n\nThe most significant highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government focused on the post-war governance of Gaza, and the strongest call is for the creation of a truly independent Palestinian state in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions, Wang said.\n\n\"The key to the Palestinian reconciliation process is to bolster confidence, keep to the right direction, and make incremental progress,\" Wang added.\n\nReconciliation is the internal affair of Palestinian factions, and cannot happen without international support. On the path toward reconciliation, China shares the same direction and destination with Arab and Islamic countries, Wang said.\n\nTang Zhichao, a scholar at the Institute of West-Asian and African Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said China has always tried to promote peace and stability in bilateral ties. Last year, China brokered a historic reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran. After the latest Israeli-Palestinian conflict erupted last October, China has been calling for a ceasefire, speeding up humanitarian aid, and a lasting, just solution to the Palestinian question.\n\n\"China's stabilizing efforts have not only helped ease tensions within the region, but also catalyzed a wave of reconciliations among Arab states and within the broader region,\" Tang added.\n\nZhu Weilie, a Middle East expert with the Shanghai International Studies University, said this is the first time that all 14 Palestinian factions gathered in Beijing and held talks for reconciliation. The signing of the Beijing Declaration is a vivid manifestation of China's concrete actions to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nThree-step initiative to solving Palestinian question\n\nWang said that the conflict in Gaza continues to drag on, and its spillover impact is spreading. \"To help get out of the current conflict and predicament, China proposes a three-step initiative.\"\n\nThe first step is to promote a comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible and ensure humanitarian assistance and relief access. The international community should further unite on the issue of ceasefire.\n\nThe second step is to uphold the principle of \"Palestinians governing Palestine\" and work together to promote post-war governance in Gaza. Gaza is an inseparable and integral part of Palestine, and restarting post-conflict reconstruction as soon as possible is an urgent priority.\n\nThe third step is to promote Palestine to become a full member of the United Nations and begin to implement the two-State solution. It is important to support the convening of a broad-based, more authoritative, and more effective international peace conference to work out a timetable and road map for the two-State solution.\n\nWang said ceasefire and humanitarian rescue are pressing priorities, \"Palestinians governing Palestine\" is the basic principle of post-conflict reconstruction in Gaza, and the two-State solution is the fundamental way out for the future. \"The international community should support the parties in taking the three steps in real earnest.\"\n\nHead of the Fatah delegation Mahmoud al-Aloul and head of the Hamas delegation Musa Abu Marzouk delivered remarks on behalf of the Palestinian factions. They noted that China holds an important place in the heart of Palestinian people, and expressed sincere appreciation for President Xi and China's unchanging, firm support and selfless assistance to Palestine over a long period of time.\n\nThey spoke highly of China's acting as a responsible major country and upholding justice for Palestine in international fora. They expressed deep appreciation for China's strong support for intra-Palestinian dialogue and reconciliation. They stated their readiness to implement the consensus, strengthen unity among factions, advance the reconciliation process, and work for an early solution to the question of Palestine.", "source":

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Hamas envoy Mousa Abou Marzouk said after Tuesday's signing ceremony.\n\nThe idea of a post-war government of technocrats for Gaza has been floated since the first months of the conflict triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attacks on Israel on October 7 last year.\n\n\"Informal meetings between Fatah and Hamas are taking place all the time,\" said Joost Hiltermann, Middle East director for the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe latest negotiations in China accomplished \"little to nothing\", he told AFP.\n\nTahani Mustafa, a senior Palestinian analyst for the ICG, said the deal should be seen in the context of recent moves by some European governments to recognize the State of Palestine.\n\n\"There is now a rising global momentum around Palestinian self-determination that the Palestinians themselves are not able to capitalize on because they're so divided amongst themselves,\" she said.\n\n- What are the obstacles? -\n\nHiltermann said determined Israeli opposition to any future role for Hamas was the most serious of an array of obstacles to the deal.\n\n\"An ideal deal would see Hamas enter the Palestine Liberation Organization in exchange for allowing the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza and oversee humanitarian aid and reconstruction,\" he said.\n\nThe PLO is an alliance of largely secular Palestinian factions historically regarded by the international community as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n\n\"Of course, there are many obstacles in the way of such a scenario, Israel being the main one,\" Hiltermann told AFP.\n\nHamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures, and Foreign Minister Israel Katz again pledged Tuesday that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\".\n\nGaza political analyst Mkhaimar Abusada criticized the \"vagueness\" of the accord's wording.\n\n\"For a Palestinian in Gaza... the agreement in Beijing is just another piece of paper,\" he said.\n\n\"There's the idea of reforming the PLO but there's no mention of how Hamas can be integrated into it.\"\n\nSome analysts questioned the genuineness of the rival factions' desire to work together, amid Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza that has killed at least 39,090 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\n\"The statement issued was not for the Palestinians; it was solely to please the Chinese friends,\" said analyst Jehad Harb.\n\n- What's in it for China? -\n\nHiltermann said China's dependence on imports of oil and gas from the region meant \"it has a stake in stability in the Middle East\".\n\nIt had a track record of fence-mending in the region, after brokering a surprise reconciliation deal between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia in March last year.\n\nQuentin Couvreur, a Chinese foreign policy researcher at Sciences Pos in Paris, said Beijing's main goal was to promote a political solution that cast Washington's dogged military support for Israel in an unfavorable light.\n\n\"The idea is to pose as a respectable, responsible superpower, and to denigrate the U.S.,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a lot of rhetoric, it's a show of diplomacy ... but in the middle and long term, I'm more skeptical over whether it will solve the Israel-Palestine conflict.\"", "source": {"uri": "naharnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naharnet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,' Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into a war with Israel who killed more than 39,000 Palestinians.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China.\n\nAs Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to 'reconciliation'.\n\n'The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,' Wang said after the factions signed the 'Beijing declaration' in the Chinese capital.\n\n'Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,' Wang said.\n\nFatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its 'unending support' for the Palestinian cause.\n\n'To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,' he said.\n\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.\n\nEgypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict.\n\nAlgeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and has drafted resolutions on the war.\n\nChina, Wang said, was keen to 'play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East'.\n\nHe also called for a 'comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire', as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nChina has positioned itself as a more neutral actor on the Israel-Palestinian conflict than its rival the United States, advocating for a two-state solution while also maintaining good ties with Israel.\n\nIn Gaza, an Israeli operation in the main southern city of Khan Yunis killed 70 people and wounded more than 200, after Israel warned its forces would 'forcefully operate' in the area.\n\nThousands of Palestinians fled southern areas of the territory following the Israeli army's temporary evacuation order for parts of Khan Yunis, including the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone.\n\nThe latest incident comes days after the health ministry said that 92 people were killed in a strike on Al-Mawasi, when Israel said that it was targeting a Hamas commander.\n\nGaza's civil defence agency said that at least 12 people were killed on Monday in Gaza City, with four others killed in the Jabalia refugee camp.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli troops killed five Palestinians, including two women, in a pre-dawn raid on a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday.\n\nThe deaths came when Israeli forces raided the Tulkarem camp in the northern West Bank, the head of its popular committee, Faisal Salamah, told AFP. An activist at the camp confirmed the outcry.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said it had treated a 30-year-old man for bullet wounds to the abdomen, thigh and hand, and three women for shrapnel wounds, one of them to the eye.\n\nPalestinian official news agency Wafa said more than 25 military vehicles, including bulldozers, stormed the camp, scooping up rubble to block off its narrow alleys.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure to reach a truce and hostage-release deal, arrived in Washington on Monday to address the US Congress.\n\nNetanyahu on Thursday will meet US President Joe Biden, who has pushed him to agree to a ceasefire, more than nine months into the Gaza war.\n\n'Due to the Israeli occupation's attacks and massacres in Khan Yunis governorate from the early hours of this morning until now, 70 people have been martyred and more than 200 wounded,' the Gaza health ministry said.\n\nFacing yet another displacement, Palestinians filled the dusty streets of Khan Yunis with cars, motorbikes, donkey-drawn carts, and on foot, carrying what belongings they could.\n\nBiden on Monday vowed to continue working to find a solution during his final months in office, a day after announcing his withdrawal from the US presidential race.\n\n'I'll be working very closely with the Israelis and with the Palestinians' to end the war, achieve peace in the Middle East and return the hostages, he said in a public call into his campaign headquarters.\n\nWashington fears a voter backlash over the mounting civilian war toll in Gaza, while protests by anti-government demonstrators and families of hostages in Israel are pressuring Netanyahu at home.\n\nAn Israeli delegation will travel to Doha on Thursday to discuss new demands for a Gaza truce and hostage-prisoner exchange, a source with knowledge of the talks said.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States have been working to secure a deal between Israel and Hamas.", "source":

[Photo/Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\n\nAt China's invitation, senior representatives of 14 Palestinian factions held reconciliation talks in Beijing from July 21 to 23.\n\nWang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and foreign minister, on Tuesday attended in Beijing the closing ceremony of the reconciliation talks of Palestinian factions and witnessed the signing of the Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity by 14 Palestinian factions.\n\nHistorical moment in Palestinian liberation cause\n\nIn his remarks, Wang noted that since entering the new era, Chinese President Xi Jinping has put forward proposals and propositions on addressing the Palestinian question, contributing Chinese wisdom and solution for addressing the question. Now, 14 Palestinian factions are gathering in Beijing with the greater good of their nation in mind.\n\n\"This is an important historical moment in the Palestinian liberation cause. China commends the reconciliation efforts made by all the factions, and congratulates them on the success of the Beijing dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration,\" Wang said.\n\nAt a daily news briefing on Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the declaration commends China's sincere effort to support the rights of the Palestinians, end division and bring about a unified position among the Palestinian factions. The declaration stresses the need to hold, under the auspices of the UN, an international conference with a full mandate and broad-based participation from the region and beyond.\n\nAccording to the declaration, parties believe that the Beijing talks demonstrated a positive and constructive spirit, and agree to realize national unity among all factions under the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, Mao said.\n\nThe declaration reaffirms commitment to establishing an independent State of Palestine with Jerusalem as the capital city based on relevant UN resolutions and ensuring the integrity of Palestinian territory including the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza. Parties are ready to, in line with the consensus of Palestinian factions and the existing basic law of Palestine, establish an interim national reconciliation government, carry out reconstruction in Gaza and prepare and hold a general election as soon as possible in accordance with the adopted election laws, according to Mao.\n\nParties stressed the need to take practical steps to form a new Palestinian national council in line with the adopted election laws. Parties unanimously agreed to activate the provisional Unified Leadership framework which will function institutionally, and jointly carry out political decision-making. Parties agreed to set up a collective mechanism to fully implement the provisions of the declaration and create a timetable for the implementation process, Mao added.\n\nPLO the sole legitimate representative of Palestinian people\n\nThe core outcome of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions held in Beijing is to specify that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people, Wang said.\n\nWang noted that the most important consensus reached at this dialogue is to achieve grand reconciliation and unity among the 14 factions, and the core outcome is to make clear that the PLO is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people.\n\nThe most significant highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government focused on the post-war governance of Gaza, and the strongest call is for the creation of a truly independent Palestinian state in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions, Wang said.\n\n\"The key to the Palestinian reconciliation process is to bolster confidence, keep to the right direction, and make incremental progress,\" Wang added.\n\nReconciliation is the internal affair of Palestinian factions, and cannot happen without international support. On the path toward reconciliation, China shares the same direction and destination with Arab and Islamic countries, Wang said.\n\nTang Zhichao, a scholar at the Institute of West-Asian and African Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said China has always tried to promote peace and stability in bilateral ties. Last year, China brokered a historic reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran. After the latest Israeli-Palestinian conflict erupted last October, China has been calling for a ceasefire, speeding up humanitarian aid, and a lasting, just solution to the Palestinian question.\n\n\"China's stabilizing efforts have not only helped ease tensions within the region, but also catalyzed a wave of reconciliations among Arab states and within the broader region,\" Tang added.\n\nZhu Weilie, a Middle East expert with the Shanghai International Studies University, said this is the first time that all 14 Palestinian factions gathered in Beijing and held talks for reconciliation. The signing of the Beijing Declaration is a vivid manifestation of China's concrete actions to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nAt China's invitation, senior representatives of 14 Palestinian factions holds reconciliation talks in Beijing from July 21 to 23. [Photo/Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\n\nThree-step initiative to solving Palestinian question\n\nWang said that the conflict in Gaza continues to drag on, and its spillover impact is spreading. \"To help get out of the current conflict and predicament, China proposes a three-step initiative.\"\n\nThe first step is to promote a comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible and ensure humanitarian assistance and relief access. The international community should further unite on the issue of ceasefire.\n\nThe second step is to uphold the principle of \"Palestinians governing Palestine\" and work together to promote post-war governance in Gaza. Gaza is an inseparable and integral part of Palestine, and restarting post-conflict reconstruction as soon as possible is an urgent priority.\n\nThe third step is to promote Palestine to become a full member of the United Nations and begin to implement the two-State solution. It is important to support the convening of a broad-based, more authoritative, and more effective international peace conference to work out a timetable and road map for the two-State solution.\n\nWang said ceasefire and humanitarian rescue are pressing priorities, \"Palestinians governing Palestine\" is the basic principle of post-conflict reconstruction in Gaza, and the two-State solution is the fundamental way out for the future. \"The international community should support the parties in taking the three steps in real earnest.\"\n\nHead of the Fatah delegation Mahmoud al-Aloul and head of the Hamas delegation Musa Abu Marzouk delivered remarks on behalf of the Palestinian factions. They noted that China holds an important place in the heart of Palestinian people, and expressed sincere appreciation for President Xi and China's unchanging, firm support and selfless assistance to Palestine over a long period of time.\n\nThey spoke highly of China's acting as a responsible major country and upholding justice for Palestine in international fora. They expressed deep appreciation for China's strong support for intra-Palestinian dialogue and reconciliation. They stated their readiness to implement the consensus, strengthen unity among factions, advance the reconciliation process, and work for an early solution to the question of Palestine.\n\nDiplomatic envoys to China or their representatives from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Russia and T\u00fcrkiye as well as representatives from 14 main Palestinian factions attended the closing ceremony.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi

Over a dozen Palestinian factions including Hamas and Fatah have agreed to end their differences to sign a unity deal in Beijing, Chinese state media said on Tuesday as Beijing continues its push to play a global peacemaker.\n\nGathering rival Palestinian factions to sign a deal comes over a year after Beijing brokered an unexpected deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Representatives of 14 Palestinian factions, including Fatah and Hamas, on Tuesday jointly pledged to end their divisions and strengthen Palestinian unity by signing the Beijing Declaration,\" state-run China Central Television (CCTV) said in a brief statement.\n\nThe representatives agreed to form an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to administer Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war ends.\n\nThe unity deal, called the 'Beijing Declaration' was signed at the closing ceremony of what Chinese state media termed as \"reconciliation dialogue\" held in Beijing between from July 21 and 23, the CCTV report said.\n\nThe announcement of the deal between bitter rivals Hamas and Fatah was made on a day when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in Washington in the backdrop of - other than US' own domestic political tumult- the nine-month long Israel-Hamas conflict with the Palestinian toll nearing 40000.

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Hamas envoy Musa Abu Marzuk said after Tuesday's signing ceremony.\n\nThe idea of a post-war government of technocrats for Gaza has been floated since the first months of the conflict triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attacks on Israel on October 7 last year.\n\n\"Informal meetings between Fatah and Hamas are taking place all the time,\" said Joost Hiltermann, Middle East director for the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe latest negotiations in China accomplished \"little to nothing\", he told AFP.\n\nTahini Mustafa, a senior Palestinian analyst for the ICG, said the deal should be seen in the context of recent moves by some European governments to recognise the State of Palestine.\n\n\"There is now a rising global momentum around Palestinian self-determination that the Palestinians themselves are not able to capitalise on because they're so divided amongst themselves,\" he said.\n\n- What are the obstacles? -\n\nHiltermann said determined Israeli opposition to any future role for Hamas was the most serious of an array of obstacles to the deal.\n\n\"An ideal deal would see Hamas enter the Palestine Liberation Organization in exchange for allowing the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza and oversee humanitarian aid and reconstruction,\" he said.\n\nThe PLO is an alliance of largely secular Palestinian factions historically regarded by the international community as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n\n\"Of course, there are many obstacles in the way of such a scenario, Israel being the main one,\" Hiltermann told AFP.\n\nHamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures, and Foreign Minister Israel Katz again pledged Tuesday that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\".\n\nGaza political analyst Mkhaimar Abusada criticised the \"vagueness\" of the accord's wording.\n\n\"For a Palestinian in Gaza... the agreement in Beijing is just another piece of paper,\" he said.\n\n\"There's the idea of reforming the PLO but there's no mention of how Hamas can be integrated into it.\"\n\nSome analysts questioned the genuineness of the rival factions' desire to work together, amid Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza that has killed at least 39,090 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\n\"The statement issued was not for the Palestinians; it was solely to please the Chinese friends,\" said

track record of fence-mending in the region, after brokering a surprise reconciliation deal between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia in March last year.\n\nQuentin Couvreur, a Chinese foreign policy researcher at Sciences Pos in Paris, said Beijing's main goal was to promote a political solution that cast Washington's dogged military support for Israel in an unfavourable light.\n\n\"The idea is to pose as a respectable, responsible superpower, and to denigrate the US,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a lot of rhetoric, it's a show of diplomacy ... but in the middle and long term, I'm more

Smaller Palestinian groups also signed the statement.\n\nFor China, the agreement represents an opportunity to promote an image of Beijing as a peace broker and an important player in the Middle East.\n\nMousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, declared that \"historic moments\" were underway. Mahmoud al-Aloul, the deputy leader of Fatah, showered praise on China for standing beside the Palestinian people. Both men posed for photos with Wang Yi, China's foreign minister, in an ornate hall in Beijing.\n\nYet for many Palestinians, without concrete steps to make the unity plan a reality, the gathering in the Chinese capital was little more than a performance -- and one they had seen before.\n\n\"What happened in China isn't significant,\" said Jehad Harb, an analyst of Palestinian affairs. \"There aren't any indications that Hamas and Fatah intend to end the split between them.\"\n\nHamas and Fatah have been deeply divided for years, each trying to present itself as the legitimate leader of the Palestinian people and wary that the other will undermine its power. Multiple past attempts to broker unity between the rival parties have resulted in joint statements and agreements, but all those efforts have failed.\n\nFatah dominates the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited authority over parts of the West Bank. Hamas, after winning Palestinian legislative elections, seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in a brief civil war in 2007, and ruled there until the war with Israel began last autumn.\n\n\"These statements aren't worth the ink needed to write them,\" said Abd Al-Rahman Basem al-Masri, 25, a resident of Deir al Balah in central Gaza. \"We've seen these things before, and we've lost hope in them.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has worked for years to deepen the division between Hamas and Fatah, seeing it as necessary to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nIsrael's foreign minister, Israel Katz, denounced Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, for agreeing to the accord, which he said would amount to nothing.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,\" Katz said in a statement. \"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nThe meeting in Beijing came as Netanyahu said during a visit to Washington that conditions for a cease-fire deal with Hamas were \"ripening.\"\n\nHe told the families of hostages in a meeting Monday that Israel was \"placing very, very heavy pressure on Hamas,\" leading the armed group to compromise on its position, according to a statement from the prime minister's office.\n\nThe families of the remaining 120 living and dead hostages in Gaza have increasingly criticized Netanyahu as not doing enough to bring home their loved ones.\n\nNetanyahu's visit, which comes at a time when Washington is intensely focused on developments in the presidential campaign, has been criticized by many Israelis, who say he is leaving the country as it battles foes on multiple fronts.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, a candidate for president, will meet with Netanyahu this week, her staff said Monday, but she will miss the prime minister's speech in Congress on Wednesday because of a previously planned event in Indianapolis.\n\nTypically, the vice president, as the president of the Senate, sits on the House rostrum beside the House speaker during joint meetings to receive a foreign leader, appearing just behind the visiting dignitary in a tacit show of support and welcome. Harris declined to preside during Netanyahu's speech, which an aide to the vice president said should not be construed as a change in her commitment to Israel's security.\n\nHer meeting with Netanyahu, which has not yet been scheduled, will be the vice president's first foreign-policy moment since President Joe Biden stepped aside from the presidential election in November and Harris moved swiftly to secure her place at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nWhite House national security officials have long stressed that Biden and Harris are in complete agreement about the situation in the Middle East and the fighting in Israel. But Harris has emerged as one of the leading voices for Palestinians in closed-door meetings at the White House.\n\nThe humanitarian straits for residents of Gaza remain perilous as Israel's military continues to hunt down Hamas militants. The military said Tuesday it was pushing ahead with operations against Hamas in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, using tanks and fighter jets to strike what it said were weapons storage facilities and observation posts. That fighting came a day after aid workers reported that dozens of people had been killed and hundreds of others wounded in the area.\n\nThe military invaded Khan Younis in December, and by spring it said that it had dismantled Hamas' command and control structure in the city. That its troops have returned there -- just as they have returned repeatedly to Gaza City after routing Hamas there -- shows that despite heavy losses, Hamas had not been fully defeated and still had some ability to regroup.\n\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday that a projectile fired by Hamas toward Israel from the area of Maghazi in central Gaza \"fell and hit a school in the area of Nuseirat,\" a town in the same part of the enclave. The military did not say whether there were casualties, and it was not immediately possible to confirm the claim.\n\nThe situation was particularly dire at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis on Tuesday. The Gaza Health Ministry said 73 people had been killed by Israel's bombardment of the area Monday, including 24 children. More than 270 others were injured, some severely, the ministry said. The figures could not be confirmed independently, and they do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\n\nJavid Abdelmoneim, the medical team leader of Doctors Without Borders at the hospital, said in an impassioned video posted Tuesday on social media that staff members were at a breaking point because of the overwhelming medical needs, not least patients with burns. Stocks of blood were at critically low levels, he said, adding that he feared the hospital would be forced to close entirely.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Reuters \"\n\nChina has done it again. After brokering a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran - of course the process was more complicated because Oman and the United Arab Emirates played a decisive role - in 2023, Beijing has brought together Hamas and Fatah and 12 other Palestinian organisations to agree to form a national unity government. The agreement was finalised in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi oversaw the signing of the agreement by Hamas' Mousa Abu Marzouk and Mahmoud al-Aloul, vice chairman of the Central Committee of Fatah. This is seen as a way to pre-empt Israel's attempt to control Gaza in a post-war situation. Abu Marzouk said, \"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity.\"\n\nHamas and Fatah have been at loggerheads for 18 years now, ever since Hamas gained control of Gaza, and Fatah remained in control of the West Bank. National elections were not held in Palestine for these 18 years. One of the components of the agreement is that there will be elections and it will be fought on a national unity platform.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative (PNI), explained the four elements of the agreement. First, the establishment of an interim national unity government, second, formation of a unified Palestinian leadership before the elections, the free elections of a new Palestinian National Council, and a general declaration of unity in the face of Israeli attacks. These are indeed the crucial elements which are necessary to hold two territories of Palestine together and also the two parties governing in each of the territories. Unity between the two wings is a necessary prelude to deal with an aggressive Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in negotiating the ceasefire, in settling the issue of hostages and the restoration of passages of transition between the two Palestinian territories and Israel. A large number of Palestinians work in Israel. It might seem bizarre but that is the kind of interdependence that binds the two irreconcilable rivals.\n\nWill this Beijing agreement succeed is a question that cannot be avoided because there was a similar agreement between Hamas and Fatah, mediated by Saudi Arabian King Abudllah Bin Abdul Aziz at Makkah in 2007. Interestingly there were four elements in the Makkah agreement too. The four were: first, end to internecine strife which resulted in the shedding of the blood of Palestinians; second, the formation of a national unity government through a constitutional system; third, to activate and reform the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), which is the umbrella organisation of all Palestinian factions and Fatah was the largest among them; fourth, effective partnership based on laws passed by the Palestinian National Council, and the affirmation of political pluralism. Unfortunately, in the years that followed the Makkah agreement, Fatah and Hamas each asserted their own power in the West Bank and in Gaza respectively.\n\nIt is quite evident that the divisions among the Palestinian factions, including Fatah and Hamas, are one of the major reasons that Israel has been sidestepping the issue of final negotiations as stipulated in the Oslo Accords. It is the final negotiations that are expected to bring a closure to the festering issue of the Palestine-Israel issue. But the internal feuds between the Fatah and Hamas were exploited by Israel.\n\nIt will need a united Palestine to negotiate hard with an intransigent Israel. Palestinian unity is a precondition of talks between Palestine and Israel. So, whatever their differences, and however sharp they may be, it is necessary for Fatah and Hamas to stand together, to push Israel into accepting the territorially defined state of Palestine.",

Fatah governs in the West Bank and previous attempts to end the faction fighting have proved elusive.\n\nThe Chinese-facilitated new accord known as the Beijing Declaration involved 14 different Palestinian groups, and a joint statement from Fatah and Hamas announcing the deal, as a prelude to a new unified government, reportedly provides no timetable or details on implementation.\n\n\"The Secretary-General encourages all factions to overcome their differences through dialogue and urges them to follow up on the commitments that were made in Beijing and the Declaration they signed on to\", said Mr. Dujarric.\n\n\"We've seen this before, we've talked about it before, and I think all steps towards unity are to be welcomed and encouraged.

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Hamas envoy Musa Abu Marzuk said after Tuesday's signing ceremony.\n\nThe idea of a post-war government of technocrats for Gaza has been floated since the first months of the conflict triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attacks on Israel on October 7 last year.\n\n\"Informal meetings between Fatah and Hamas are taking place all the time,\" said Joost Hiltermann, Middle East director for the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe latest negotiations in China accomplished \"little to nothing\", he told AFP.\n\nTahini Mustafa, a senior Palestinian analyst for the ICG, said the deal should be seen in the context of recent moves by some European governments to recognise the State of Palestine.\n\n\"There is now a rising global momentum around Palestinian self-determination that the Palestinians themselves are not able to capitalise on because they're so divided amongst themselves,\" he said.\n\n- What are the obstacles? -\n\nHiltermann said determined Israeli opposition to any future role for Hamas was the most serious of an array of obstacles to the deal.\n\n\"An ideal deal would see Hamas enter the Palestine Liberation Organization in exchange for allowing the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza and oversee humanitarian aid and reconstruction,\" he said.\n\nThe PLO is an alliance of largely secular Palestinian factions historically regarded by the international community as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n\nMore from this section 'Everything is ruined.'

deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures, and Foreign Minister Israel Katz again pledged Tuesday that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\".\n\nGaza political analyst Mkhaimar Abusada criticised the \"vagueness\" of the accord's wording.\n\n\"For a Palestinian in Gaza... the agreement in Beijing is just another piece of paper,\" he said.\n\n\"There's the idea of reforming the PLO but there's no mention of how Hamas can be integrated into it.\"\n\nSome analysts questioned the genuineness of the rival factions' desire to work together, amid Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza that has killed at least 39,090 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\n\"The statement issued was not for the Palestinians; it was solely to please the Chinese friends,\" said analyst Jehad Harb.\n\n- What's in it for China? -\n\nHiltermann said China's dependence on imports of oil and gas from the region meant \"it has a stake in stability in the Middle East\".\n\nIt had a track record of fence-mending in the region, after brokering a surprise reconciliation deal between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia in March last year.\n\nQuentin Couvreur, a Chinese foreign policy researcher at Sciences Pos in Paris, said Beijing's main goal was to promote a political solution that cast Washington's dogged military support for Israel in an unfavourable light.\n\n\"The idea is to pose as a respectable, responsible superpower, and to denigrate the US,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a lot of rhetoric, it's a show of diplomacy ... but in the middle and long term, I'm more sceptical over whether it will solve the Israel-Palestine conflict.\"\n\ncrb-he-lba/jd/kir/dv", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "louis_baudoin_laarman@reformer.com", "name": "Louis

After brokering a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran - of course the process was more complicated because Oman and the United Arab Emirates played a decisive role - in 2023, Beijing has brought together Hamas and Fatah and 12 other Palestinian organisations to agree to form a national unity government. The agreement was finalised in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi oversaw the signing of the agreement by Hamas' Mousa Abu Marzouk and Mahmoud al-Aloul, vice chairman of the Central Committee of Fatah. This is seen as a way to pre-empt Israel's attempt to control Gaza in a post-war situation. Abu Marzouk said, \"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity.\"\n\nHamas and Fatah have been at loggerheads for 18 years now, ever since Hamas gained control of Gaza, and Fatah remained in control of the West Bank. National elections were not held in Palestine for these 18 years. One of the components of the agreement is that there will be elections and it will be fought on a national unity platform.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative (PNI), explained the four elements of the agreement. First, the establishment of an interim national unity government, second, formation of a unified Palestinian leadership before the elections, the free elections of a new Palestinian National Council, and a general declaration of unity in the face of Israeli attacks.\n\nThese are indeed the crucial elements which are necessary to hold two territories of Palestine together and also the two parties governing in each of the territories. Unity between the two wings is a necessary prelude to deal with an aggressive Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in negotiating the ceasefire, in settling the issue of hostages and the restoration of passages of transition between the two Palestinian territories and Israel. A large number of Palestinians work in Israel. It might seem bizarre but that is the kind of interdependence that binds the two irreconcilable rivals.\n\nWill this Beijing agreement succeed is a question that cannot be avoided because there was a similar agreement between Hamas and Fatah, mediated by Saudi Arabian King Abudllah Bin Abdul Aziz at Makkah in 2007. Interestingly there were four elements in the Makkah agreement too. The four were: first, end to internecine strife which resulted in the shedding of the blood of Palestinians; second, the formation of a national unity government through a constitutional system; third, to activate and reform the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), which is the umbrella organisation of all Palestinian factions and Fatah was the largest among them; fourth, effective partnership based on laws passed by the Palestinian National Council, and the affirmation of political pluralism. Unfortunately, in the years that followed the Makkah agreement, Fatah and Hamas each asserted their own power in the West Bank and in Gaza respectively.\n\nIt is quite evident that the divisions among the Palestinian factions, including Fatah and Hamas, are one of the major reasons that Israel has been sidestepping the issue of final negotiations as stipulated in the Oslo Accords. It is the final negotiations that are expected to bring a closure to the festering issue of the Palestine-Israel issue. But the internal feuds between the Fatah and Hamas were exploited by Israel. It will need a united Palestine to negotiate hard with an intransigent Israel. Palestinian unity is a precondition of talks between Palestine and Israel. So, whatever their differences, and however sharp they may be, it is necessary for Fatah and Hamas to stand together, to push Israel into accepting the territorially defined state of Palestine.",

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Hamas envoy Musa Abu Marzuk said after Tuesday's signing ceremony.\n\nThe idea of a post-war government of technocrats for Gaza has been floated since the first months of the conflict triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attacks on Israel on October 7 last year.\n\n\"Informal meetings between Fatah and Hamas are taking place all the time,\" said Joost Hiltermann, Middle East director for the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe latest negotiations in China accomplished \"little to nothing\", he told AFP.\n\nTahini Mustafa, a senior Palestinian analyst for the ICG, said the deal should be seen in the context of recent moves by some European governments to recognise the State of Palestine.\n\n\"There is now a rising global momentum around Palestinian self-determination that the Palestinians themselves are not able to capitalise on because they're so divided amongst themselves,\" he said.\n\n- What are the obstacles? -\n\nHiltermann said determined Israeli opposition to any future role for Hamas was the most serious of an array of obstacles to the deal.\n\n\"An ideal deal would see Hamas enter the Palestine Liberation Organization in exchange for allowing the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza and oversee humanitarian aid and reconstruction,\" he said.\n\nThe PLO is an alliance of largely secular Palestinian factions historically regarded by the international community as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n\n\"Of course, there are many obstacles in the way of such a scenario, Israel being the main one,\" Hiltermann told AFP.\n\nHamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures, and Foreign Minister Israel Katz again pledged Tuesday that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\".\n\nGaza political analyst Mkhaimar Abusada criticised the \"vagueness\" of the accord's wording.\n\n\"For a Palestinian in Gaza... the agreement in Beijing is just another piece of paper,\" he said.\n\n\"There's the idea of reforming the PLO but there's no mention of how Hamas can be integrated into it.\"\n\nSome analysts questioned the genuineness of the rival factions' desire to work together, amid Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza that has killed at least 39,090 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\n\"The statement issued was not for the Palestinians; it was solely to please the Chinese friends,\" said analyst Jehad Harb.\n\n- What's in it for China? -\n\nHiltermann said China's dependence on imports of oil and gas from the region meant \"it has a stake in stability in the Middle East\".\n\nIt had a track record of fence-mending in the region, after brokering a surprise reconciliation deal between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia in March last year.\n\nQuentin Couvreur, a Chinese foreign policy researcher at Sciences Pos in Paris, said Beijing's main goal was to promote a political solution that cast Washington's dogged military support for Israel in an unfavourable light.\n\n\"The idea is to pose as a respectable, responsible superpower, and to denigrate the US,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a lot of rhetoric, it's a show of diplomacy ... but in the middle and long term, I'm more sceptical over whether it will solve the Israel-Palestine conflict.\"\n\ncrb-he-lba/jd/kir/dv\n\nMore from this section\n\nOptimal Blue Launches New Generative AI Assistant Capabilities\n\nPromoting

But it offers little about how such a government would be formed, or when. Smaller Palestinian groups also signed the statement.\n\nFor China, the agreement represents an opportunity to promote an image of Beijing as a peace broker and an important player in the Middle East.\n\nMousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, declared that \"historic moments\" were underway. Mahmoud al-Aloul, the deputy leader of Fatah, showered praise on China for standing beside the Palestinian people. Both men posed for photos with Wang Yi, China's foreign minister, in an ornate hall in Beijing.\n\nYet, for many Palestinians, without concrete steps to make the unity plan a reality, the gathering in the Chinese capital was little more than a performance -- and one they had seen before.\n\n\"What happened in China isn't significant,\" said Jehad Harb, an analyst of Palestinian affairs. \"There aren't any indications that Hamas and Fatah intend to end the split between them.\"\n\nHamas and Fatah have been deeply divided for years, each trying to present itself as the legitimate leader of the Palestinian people and wary that the other will undermine its power. Multiple past attempts to broker unity between the rival parties have resulted in joint statements and agreements, but all those efforts have failed.\n\nFatah dominates the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited authority over parts of the West Bank. Hamas, after winning Palestinian legislative elections, seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in a brief civil war in 2007, and ruled there until the war with Israel began last autumn.\n\n\"These statements aren't worth the ink needed to write them,\" said Abd Al-Rahman Basem al-Masri, 25, a resident of Deir al Balah in central Gaza. \"We've seen these things before, and we've lost hope in them.\"\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has worked for years to deepen the division between Hamas and Fatah, seeing it as necessary to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nIsrael's foreign minister, Israel Katz, denounced Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, for agreeing to the accord, which he said would amount to nothing.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,\" Mr. Katz said in a statement. \"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nThe meeting in Beijing came as Mr. Netanyahu said during a visit to Washington that conditions for a cease-fire deal with Hamas were \"ripening.\"\n\nHe told the families of hostages in a meeting on Monday that Israel was \"placing very, very heavy pressure on Hamas,\" leading the armed group to compromise on its position, according to a statement from the prime minister's office.\n\nThe families of the remaining 120 living and dead hostages in Gaza have increasingly criticized Mr. Netanyahu as not doing enough to bring home their loved ones.\n\nMr. Netanyahu's visit, which comes at a time when Washington is intensely focused on developments in the presidential campaign, has been criticized by many Israelis, who say he is leaving the country as it battles foes on multiple fronts.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, a candidate for president, will meet with Mr. Netanyahu this week, her staff said on Monday, but she will miss the prime minister's speech in Congress on Wednesday because of a previously planned event Indianapolis.\n\nTypically, the vice president, as the president of the Senate, sits on the House rostrum beside the House speaker during joint meetings to receive a foreign leader, appearing just behind the visiting dignitary in a tacit show of support and welcome. Ms. Harris declined to preside during Mr. Netanyahu's speech, which an aide to the vice president said should not be construed as a change in her commitment to Israel's security.\n\nHer meeting with Mr. Netanyahu, which has not yet been scheduled, will be the vice president's first foreign-policy moment since President Biden stepped aside from the presidential election in November and Ms. Harris moved swiftly to secure her place at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nWhite House national security officials have long stressed that Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris are in complete agreement about the situation in the Middle East and the fighting in Israel. But Ms. Harris has emerged as one of the leading voices for Palestinians in closed-door meetings at the White House.\n\nThe humanitarian straits of Gazans remain perilous as Israel's military continues to hunt down Hamas militants. The military said on Tuesday it was pushing ahead with operations against Hamas in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, using tanks and fighter jets to strike what it said were weapons storage facilities and observation posts. That fighting came a day after aid workers reported that dozens of people had been killed and hundreds of others wounded in the area.\n\nThe military invaded Khan Younis in December, and by spring it said that it had dismantled Hamas's command and control structure in the city. That its troops have returned there -- just as they have returned repeatedly to Gaza City after routing Hamas there -- shows that despite heavy losses, Hamas had not been fully defeated and still had some ability to regroup.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Tuesday that a projectile fired by Hamas toward Israel from the area of Maghazi in central Gaza \"fell and hit a school in the area of Nuseirat,\" a town in the same part of the enclave. The military did not say whether there were casualties, and it was not immediately possible to confirm the claim.\n\nThe situation was particularly dire at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis on Tuesday. The Gazan Health Ministry said that 73 people had been killed by Israel's bombardment of the area on Monday, including 24 children. More than 270 others were injured, some severely, the ministry said. The figures could not be confirmed independently, and they do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\n\nJavid Abdelmoneim, the medical team leader of Doctors Without Borders at the hospital, said in an impassioned video posted on social media on Tuesday that staff members were at a breaking point because of the overwhelming medical needs, not least patients with burns. Stocks of blood were at critically low levels, he said, adding that he feared the hospital would be forced to close entirely.\n\nZixu Wang contributed reporting from Hong Kong, Michael D.

Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN chief, said Guterres \"very much welcomes the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the Palestinian factions\".\n\nTerming the deal as \"an important step toward furthering Palestinian unity,\" Dujarric said the secretary-general \"encourages all factions to overcome their differences through dialogue and urges them to follow up on the commitments that were made in Beijing and the declaration they signed on to\".\n\n\"We've seen this before, we've talked about it before, and I think all steps toward unity are to be welcomed and encouraged,\" he said.\n\nGuterres also expressed his appreciation for the diplomatic efforts being made by China as well as efforts of other countries involved in facilitating the process, Dujarric said.\n\nOn his X account, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said he commended the Chinese government for facilitating talks between Fatah, Hamas and 12 other Palestinian political factions.\n\n\"It is my sincere hope that this declaration of unity will translate into tangible results on the ground and withstand future challenges,\" said Anwar, adding that all relevant parties \"must work toward ending the barbaric attacks on the Palestinians by Israeli forces\".\n\nIn addition, he said: \"I urge Governments around the world that have not yet recognized the State of Palestine to immediately recognize it, in addition to supporting this declaration of unity.\"\n\nPakistan's Prime Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif said on his X account that he applauded the People's Republic of China \"for securing this diplomatic success\".\n\nToday's agreement ignites hope that lasting peace can be achieved, he said.\n\n\"The world must stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people and urge Israel to end its brazen violence that has destroyed Gaza and killed around 40,000 innocent Palestinians during the last ten months,\" said Sharif as he affirmed Pakistan's unwavering support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nSven Koopmans, the European Union Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process, at learning about the Beijing Declaration, said on his X account: China has an important role in reconciliation based on the two-State solution and a halt to violence. Glad to work jointly for ME (Middle East) peace.\"\n\nThe Foreign Ministry of Turkey said in a statement: \"We welcome the gathering of Palestinian political factions in Beijing at the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and their acceptance of a declaration aimed at achieving national unity.\"\n\nTurkey expects the longstanding efforts aimed at achieving political unity in Palestine to yield positive results \"as soon as possible,\" according to Anadolu Agency.\n\nThe Sultanate of Oman also welcomed the meeting of Palestinian factions in China and the ensuing signing of the Beijing Declaration.\n\nIn a statement issued by Oman's Foreign Ministry, Oman stressed the significance of Palestinians joining ranks and called for empowering Palestinians \"by all political and diplomatic means towards the prime goal of ending the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories\", according to a report by the Oman News Agency.\n\nOman emphasized that this \"highly needed goal\" should be achieved in a manner that \"is consistent with the Palestinian people's aspirations for freedom and peace, as well as the realization of relevant resolutions of international legitimacy\".\n\nMany excited Gaza residents have expressed hopes that the declaration will end their years-long suffering. But Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, Israel Katz, slammed the agreement in his X account post.\n\nJasim Husain, a Gulf analyst and former member of Bahrain's parliament, told China Daily that the latest development is an \"exceptional success for Chinese diplomacy for facilitating an agreement between so many Palestinian factions\".\n\n\"China doing the unimaginable and doing so in critical times during the war in Gaza and arranging for the day when the hostilities are over. The challenge now lies in securing international support for the deal and ensuring that Israel would not rock the boat,\" said Husain.\n\n\"Once again, the olive branch for peace in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region comes from China,\" he added.\n\nEbrahim Hashem, an Asia Global fellow at the Asia Global Institute of the University of Hong Kong, called China's latest move \"another major diplomatic breakthrough for China in the Middle East\", following Beijing's mediation of the Saudi-Iran reconciliation in March last year.\n\n\"China's position on Palestine represents the international consensus that only a two-state solution can end the central issue of the region,\" said Hashem, who is also a former adviser to the chairman of Abu Dhabi Executive Office and former head of the strategy division of Abu Dhabi National Oil.\n\nHashem told China Daily that by bringing the Palestinian groups together and signing a declaration, China has demonstrated that there is \"a better and more positive way to address the question of Palestine\".\n\nHussein Maklad, professor of international relations at Damascus University in Syria, told China Daily that the Palestinian conciliation in China is \"a very important achievement\" for Palestinian people who \"suffer from genocide committed by Israel with full support of the United States and impunity\".\n\n\"The American administrations have done almost everything possible to divide the Palestinians. Dividing the Palestinians in fact entrenches the status quo, makes it impossible to change the situation where Israel is making negotiations impossible by expanding settlements and so on,\" said Maklad.\n\nHe recalled Fatah and Hamas having agreed to unite in the past, but only to have those agreements collapse due to their conflicting strategies and \"pressures from countries like the US and some European countries\" that are aligned with Israel's policies.\n\nHe believes the US and Israel \"don't want the Palestinians to get their act together\" as it helps Israel \"maintain indefinite control over the occupied territories and expanding settlements\".\n\n\"I think it is time for Palestinians to unite against Israeli brutality and reach to the minimal consensus terms which would probably be a return to or very close to the pre-1967 frontiers,\" said Maklad.\n\n\"There should also be a resolution of the refugee issue stemming from the 1948 War of Independence when thousands of Palestinians fled. That would demonstrate some acceptance by Israel of Israeli responsibility, \"he added.\n\nDina Yulianti Sulaeman, director of the Indonesia Center for Middle East Studies, told China Daily, that the success of 14 Palestinian factions, especially Hamas and Fatah, in joining an agreement \"is due to China's impartial efforts\", which \"provide space for the Palestinian people to formulate what is best for them\".\n\n\"The result would be much different if the mediator were the US, which from the start was clear that it would always side with Israel. The signing of the declaration shows that sincere Chinese-style diplomacy has a greater chance of helping the Palestinian cause, which has been going on for 76 years,\" said Sulaeman.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration proposes hosting an international conference with broad participation and full authority. It also calls for achieving comprehensive national unity, which would include all Palestinian factions within the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nCalling the Palestinian issue the core issue of the Middle East, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China has no selfish interests in the issue and remains a staunch advocate of justice and fairness.\n\n\"China has a lot of political capital, credibility and goodwill in the region. China's position on core regional issues is aligned with that of the Arabs and the global majority,\" said Hashem from the UAE.\n\n\"China's diplomatic breakthroughs are proving that the Middle East is experiencing the birth of a new regional order, in which no one single country or bloc of countries will have monopoly and that a new framework will have to be used to deal with the regional affairs,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "global.chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "global.chinadaily.com.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Fatah governs in the West Bank and previous attempts to end the faction fighting have proved elusive.)\n\nThe new accord known as the Beijing Declaration involved 14 different Palestinian groups, and a joint statement from Fatah and Hamas announcing the deal, as a prelude to a new unified government, reportedly provides no timetable or details on implementation.\n\n\"The Secretary-General encourages all factions to overcome their differences through dialogue and urges them to follow up on the commitments that were made in Beijing and the Declaration they signed on to\", Dujarric said.\n\n\"We've seen this before, we've talked about it before, and I think all steps towards unity are to be welcomed and encouraged. Palestinian unity, as we've said many a time, is crucial for peace and security and for advancing the aspirations of the Palestinian people for self-determination and for a fully independent, democratic, contiguous, viable and sovereign Palestinian State\", he added.\n\nGuterres expressed his appreciation for the diplomatic efforts being made by China \"as well as efforts of other countries involved in facilitating the process.\"\n\nThe UN is committed to working towards a comprehensive two-State solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict with secure, recognized borders on the basis of pre-1967 lines which would have Jerusalem as the capital of both States, in line with UN resolutions and international law, the spokesperson said.\n\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas as its central war aim in Gaza and has up to now, indicated that it will not relinquish control of the enclave or allow the current Palestinian Authority to become the governing power there.", "source":

Now, 14 Palestinian factions are gathering in Beijing with the greater good of their nation in mind.\n\n\"This is an important historical moment in the Palestinian liberation cause. China commends the reconciliation efforts made by all the factions, and congratulates them on the success of the Beijing dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration,\" Wang said.\n\nAt a daily news briefing on Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the declaration commends China's sincere effort to support the rights of the Palestinians, end division and bring about a unified position among the Palestinian factions. The declaration stresses the need to hold, under the auspices of the UN, an international conference with a full mandate and broad-based participation from the region and beyond.\n\nAccording to the declaration, parties believe that the Beijing talks demonstrated a positive and constructive spirit, and agree to realize national unity among all factions under the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, Mao said.\n\nThe declaration reaffirms commitment to establishing an independent State of Palestine with Jerusalem as the capital city based on relevant UN resolutions and ensuring the integrity of Palestinian territory including the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza. Parties are ready to, in line with the consensus of Palestinian factions and the existing basic law of Palestine, establish an interim national reconciliation government, carry out reconstruction in Gaza and prepare and hold a general election as soon as possible in accordance with the adopted election laws, according to Mao.\n\nParties stressed the need to take practical steps to form a new Palestinian national council in line with the adopted election laws. Parties unanimously agreed to activate the provisional Unified Leadership framework which will function institutionally, and jointly carry out political decision-making. Parties agreed to set up a collective mechanism to fully implement the provisions of the declaration and create a timetable for the implementation process, Mao added.\n\nPLO THE SOLE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE\n\nThe core outcome of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions held in Beijing is to specify that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people, Wang said.\n\nWang noted that the most important consensus reached at this dialogue is to achieve grand reconciliation and unity among the 14 factions, and the core outcome is to make clear that the PLO is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people.\n\nThe most significant highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government focused on the post-war governance of Gaza, and the strongest call is for the creation of a truly independent Palestinian state in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions, Wang said.\n\n\"The key to the Palestinian reconciliation process is to bolster confidence, keep to the right direction, and make incremental progress,\" Wang added.\n\nReconciliation is the internal affair of Palestinian factions, and cannot happen without international support. On the path toward reconciliation, China shares the same direction and destination with Arab and Islamic countries, Wang said.\n\nTang Zhichao, a scholar at the Institute of West-Asian and African Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said China has always tried to promote peace and stability in bilateral ties. Last year, China brokered a historic reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran. After the latest Israeli-Palestinian conflict erupted last October, China has been calling for a ceasefire, speeding up humanitarian aid, and a lasting, just solution to the Palestinian question.\n\n\"China's stabilizing efforts have not only helped ease tensions within the region, but also catalyzed a wave of reconciliations among Arab states and within the broader region,\" Tang added.\n\nZhu Weilie, a Middle East expert with the Shanghai International Studies University, said this is the first time that all 14 Palestinian factions gathered in Beijing and held talks for reconciliation. The signing of the Beijing Declaration is a vivid manifestation of China's concrete actions to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nTHREE-STEP INITIATIVE TO SOLVING PALESTINIAN QUESTION\n\nWang said that the conflict in Gaza continues to drag on, and its spillover impact is spreading. \"To help get out of the current conflict and predicament, China proposes a three-step initiative.\"\n\nThe first step is to promote a comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible and ensure humanitarian assistance and relief access. The international community should further unite on the issue of ceasefire.\n\nThe second step is to uphold the principle of \"Palestinians governing Palestine\" and work together to promote post-war governance in Gaza. Gaza is an inseparable and integral part of Palestine, and restarting post-conflict reconstruction as soon as possible is an urgent priority.\n\nThe third step is to promote Palestine to become a full member of the United Nations and begin to implement the two-State solution. It is important to support the convening of a broad-based, more authoritative, and more effective international peace conference to work out a timetable and road map for the two-State solution.\n\nWang said ceasefire and humanitarian rescue are pressing priorities, \"Palestinians governing Palestine\" is the basic principle of post-conflict reconstruction in Gaza, and the two-State solution is the fundamental way out for the future. \"The international community should support the parties in taking the three steps in real earnest.\"\n\nHead of the Fatah delegation Mahmoud al-Aloul and head of the Hamas delegation Musa Abu Marzouk delivered remarks on behalf of the Palestinian factions. They noted that China holds an important place in the heart of Palestinian people, and expressed sincere appreciation for President Xi and China's unchanging, firm support and selfless assistance to Palestine over a long period of time.\n\nThey spoke highly of China's acting as a responsible major country and upholding justice for Palestine in international fora. They expressed deep appreciation for China's strong support for intra-Palestinian dialogue and reconciliation. They stated their readiness to implement the consensus, strengthen unity among factions, advance the reconciliation process, and work for an early solution to the question of Palestine.\n\nDiplomatic envoys to China or their representatives from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Russia and T\u00fcrkiye as well as representatives from 14 main Palestinian factions attended the closing ceremony. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians",

Credit: Chinese Foreign Ministry\n\nChina firmly supports the just cause of the Palestinian people in restoring their legitimate national rights, supports all Palestinian factions in achieving reconciliation through dialogue and consultation, and supports Palestine in realizing solidarity, unity and independent statehood at the earliest possible date. China has been and will continue to make relentless effort to this end. Mao Ning, China's Foreign Ministry Spokesman\n\nChina has brought together 14 disparate Palestinian groups and helped them form a unity government that will rule Gaza when the Israeli onslaught ends.\n\nOn Tuesday, leaders of the main Palestinian factions -- including Hamas and Fatah -- signed the Beijing Declaration which establishes an interim national reconciliation government\" to rule post-war Gaza. The groundbreaking agreement represents the first step towards rapprochement between traditional rivals who have put their differences behind them in the interests of the beleaguered Palestinian people.\n\nIn order to capitalize on the progress they've made in Beijing, Palestinian leaders need to call a broad and fully authorized international conference under the auspices of the UN, with regional and international participation.\" By doing this, they will draw more attention to their decades-long struggle for self-determination, which is already gaining momentum due to Israel's genocidal rampage in Gaza. With the establishment of a de facto national unity government, the Palestinians will also be in a position to request international peacekeepers to protect their legal (1967) borders, which Israel fails to recognize, and which are the source of the ongoing dispute. In order for international law to have any meaning, UN resolutions must be enforceable. Thus, the legitimacy of the United Nations depends largely on its ability to establish and defend a Palestinian state against Zionist aggression. This is from an article at the Global Times:\n\nChina has made another significant contribution to the peace and stability of a world in turbulence as 14 factions from Palestine, including Fatah and Hamas, with key support from China, reached a historic declaration for nationwide reconciliation in Beijing on Tuesday. Experts said it will be a key step for Palestinian people to achieve their goal of establishing a state and the realization of long-standing peace between Palestine and Israel....\n\nThe latest.... events on the Palestine issue and the Ukraine crisis prove that China, which always upholds its stance for peace... is taking concrete actions to contribute to political settlements, despite the US and US-led military alliances like NATO continuing to add uncertainties and obstacles. China will continue with its efforts to ensure that peace processes in different regions of the world can be delivered...\n\nHistoric declaration for Palestine...\n\nThe core outcome of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions held in Beijing is to specify that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday....\n\nMa Xiaolin, dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the declaration is absolutely historic, significant and unprecedented.... (it) is not just a document, but a feasible roadmap with international support and supervision from not only major regional countries but permanent members of the UN Security Council.\"... Global Times\n\nChinese diplomats expect the path to peace to be implemented in three phases:\n\nChina should be applauded for bringing the rival factions together and making such a courageous effort to bring the 10 month-long bloodbath in Gaza to an end. They should also be commended for understanding that the broader crisis cannot be resolved without internal reconciliation, which is why China's foreign ministry arranged to bring all the factions together at one time. Fortunately, the three-day confab helped the leaders to iron-out their differences on key issues including the creation of a provisional national reconciliation government that will be formed according to the consensus of Palestinian factions and the current Basic Law of the Palestine.\"\n\nThis is a remarkable achievement for China which has already distinguished itself as the world leader in promoting policies of peace and non-intervention. Keep in mind, that China recently helped to reestablish diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia and, also, has made numerous efforts to mediate an end to the war in Ukraine. Wherever hotspots emerge and fighting breaks out, China can be found dousing the flames and trying to bring the opposing-sides to the negotiating table. And while their actions may be ignored by the western media, they are having an impact all the same.\n\nThe world needs an actively engaged China to offset the destabilizing effects of Washington's endless coups, interventions and wars. The Beijing Declaration shows what progress can be made when right-minded leaders act in the interests of peace and conflict resolution.\n\nChina Brings Peace to the Middle East while Washington Bombs

Fatah governs in the West Bank and previous attempts to end the faction fighting have proved elusive.)\n\nThe new accord known as the Beijing Declaration involved 14 different Palestinian groups, and a joint statement from Fatah and Hamas announcing the deal, as a prelude to a new unified government, reportedly provides no timetable or details on implementation.\n\n\"The Secretary-General encourages all factions to overcome their differences through dialogue and urges them to follow up on the commitments that were made in Beijing and the Declaration they signed on to\", Dujarric said.\n\n\"We've seen this before, we've talked about it before, and I think all steps towards unity are to be welcomed and encouraged. Palestinian unity, as we've said many a time, is crucial for peace and security and for advancing the aspirations of the Palestinian people for self-determination and for a fully independent, democratic, contiguous, viable and sovereign Palestinian State\", he added.\n\nGuterres expressed his appreciation for the diplomatic efforts being made by China \"as well as efforts of other countries involved in facilitating the process.\"\n\nThe UN is committed to working towards a comprehensive two-State solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict with secure, recognized borders on the basis of pre-1967 lines which would have Jerusalem as the capital of both States, in line with UN resolutions and international law, the spokesperson said.\n\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas as its

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzouk, Fatah envoy Mahmoud Al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to govern post-war Gaza.\n\n\"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzouk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys. The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis. China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China. As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said after the factions signed the \"Beijing Declaration\" in the Chinese capital. \"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\nFatah official Aloul thanked China for its \"unending support\" for the Palestinian cause. \"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,\" he said. Notably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions. Also present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.\n\nBut the Zionist entity swiftly condemned the agreement. The diplomatic spat came as the Zionist entity hammered Gaza, including the southern city of Khan Yunis, where it had ordered a partial evacuation of civilians. Foreign Minister Israel Katz insisted that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\" and accused Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah faction signed the deal, of embracing Hamas.\n\nAny involvement by the Islamist militant group in the post-war governance of Gaza is anathema to the United States as well as the Zionist entity. Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington to address a joint session of Congress and has vowed to continue the Gaza war until Hamas is destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas' political bureau, framed China's involvement as a way to counter US influence. He said Washington \"opposes any internal Palestinian national consensus and is completely biased (and) even partners with the occupation in its crimes against our people\". Katz also rejected any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, saying \"Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar\".\n\nOn the ground, the Zionist entity pressed on with the war in Gaza. Hours after it ordered civilians to evacuate parts of Khan Yunis, including areas that had been declared part of a humanitarian safe zone, its jets pounded the city. The Gaza health ministry said 73 people had been killed and more than 200 wounded in the area.\n\nHassan Qudayh, a resident forced to evacuate, said: \"Gaza is over, Gaza is dead, Gaza has gone. There is nothing left, nothing\". AFP correspondents reported air strikes in Gaza City and Jabalia in the north of the territory, as well as Khan Yunis. More than nine months of war have obliterated much of the territory's healthcare capacity, with what remains under immense pressure.\n\nMohammed Zaqout, the director of Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, told AFP: \"There is no space for more patients. There's no space in the operating theatres. There is a lack of medical supplies, so we cannot save our patients.\" The World Health Organization said up to 14,000 people needed medical evacuation from Gaza and that it was \"extremely worried\" about disease outbreaks in the territory.\n\nPalestinian officials said a Zionist raid in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday killed five people, including a woman and her daughter. During the pre-dawn operation in Tulkarem refugee camp, Zionist drones struck and killed the head of Hamas' military wing in Tulkarem, Ashraf Nafea, the military said in a statement. Hamas confirmed the \"cowardly assassination\" of commander Nafea and his companions.\n\nThe head of the camp committee told AFP Zionist troops killed five people in the operation. \"A mother and her daughter were martyred and three young men were struck by a drone,\" Faisal Salamah said. An activist from the camp, who asked not to be identified, confirmed the toll and told AFP the woman and her daughter were volunteers with the ambulance service. - Agencies", "source": {"uri":

Hamas official", "body": "Tehran, IRNA - The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas' representative in Lebanon, while assessing a reconciliation agreement between Palestinian groups in the meeting hosted by China, has said that the decision to put aside their differences carry the message of the unity of the Palestinian nation as a result of the Al-Aqsa storm operation.\n\nAccording to IRNA, Ahmad Abdel Hadi told Al-Mayadeen that what is new in Beijing's statement is the context that led to it, and is the outcome of the \"Al-Aqsa Storm\".\n\nThe Beijing meeting carries an important message that the Palestinian nation is united and what will happen in the Gaza Strip in the future will be according to the decision of the Palestinians, he said\n\nPointing to the plans to deploy foreign forces in Gaza, Abdel Hadi emphasized that any such forces will be treated as occupying forces.\n\nThe Hamas representative in Lebanon continued by saying that \"Beijing Declaration\" places a great responsibility on the Palestinian leadership to take advantage of the Al-Aqsa Storm and confront the Israeli genocide in Gaza.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced on Tuesday that at the end of a two-day meeting in Beijing 14 Palestinian groups, including the Gaza-based Hamas and the occupied West Bank-based Fatah Movement reached an agreement on the establishment of an \"Interim Government of National Reconciliation\" in the Gaza Strip after the war.\n\nAccording to a statement reported by the Chinese media, Palestinian groups also welcomed the ruling of the International Court of Justice regarding the illegality of the occupation of the Zionist regime and its settlements in Palestinian lands.\n\nIn April, Beijing hosted the first round of meetings between Fatah and Hamas officials to reach an agreement and resolve their long-standing differences.\n\nChina has historically supported the cause of Palestine and has been in favor of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAfter Wang said in April that the United States should support the UN resolution to establish a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Chinese officials have increasingly addressed the issue of the ongoing Israeli crimes in Gaza.\n\nRepeating Beijing's calls for an immediate ceasefire, Wang had described Israel's war on Gaza as \"a tragedy for humanity and a disgrace to civilization.\"\n\nMeanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the agreement that was brokered by China aimed at reconciliation between Hamas and other Palestinian factions.\n\n\"I think all steps towards unity are welcome and encouraged\", IRNA quoted UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric as telling reporters on Tuesday local time that Guterres welcomes the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the Palestinian factions.\n\nDuring their meeting in China, Palestinian groups also called for an effort to lift the barbaric siege imposed on the Palestinian nation, especially in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and for humanitarian and medical aid to reach the Gaza Strip unconditionally, and to confront the occupation's conspiracies and their continuous aggression against Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\n4399", "source": {"uri": "en.irna.ir", "dataType": "news", "title": "IRNA English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Palestinian analyst for the ICG, said the deal should be seen in the context of recent moves by some European governments to recognise the State of Palestine.\n\n\"There is now a rising global momentum around Palestinian self-determination that the Palestinians themselves are not able to capitalise on because they're so divided amongst themselves,\" he said.\n\n- What are the obstacles? -\n\nHiltermann said determined Israeli opposition to any future role for Hamas was the most serious of an array of obstacles to the deal.\n\n\"An ideal deal would see Hamas enter the Palestine Liberation Organization in exchange for allowing the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza and oversee humanitarian aid and reconstruction,\" he said.\n\nThe PLO is an alliance of largely secular Palestinian factions historically regarded by the international community as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n\n\"Of course, there are many obstacles in the way of such a scenario, Israel being the main one,\" Hiltermann told AFP.\n\nHamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures, and Foreign Minister Israel Katz again pledged Tuesday that \"Hamas rule will be crushed\".\n\nGaza political analyst Mkhaimar Abusada criticised the \"vagueness\" of the accord's wording.\n\n\"For a Palestinian in Gaza... the agreement in Beijing is just another piece of paper,\" he said.\n\n\"There's the idea of reforming the PLO but there's no mention of how Hamas can be integrated into it.\"\n\nSome analysts questioned the genuineness of the rival factions' desire to work together, amid Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza that has killed at least 39,090 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\n\"The statement issued was not for the Palestinians; it was solely to please the Chinese friends,\" said analyst Jehad Harb.\n\n- What's in it for China? -\n\nHiltermann said China's dependence on imports of oil and gas from the region meant \"it has a stake in stability in the Middle East\".\n\nIt had a track record of fence-mending in the region, after brokering a surprise reconciliation deal between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia in March last year.\n\nQuentin Couvreur, a Chinese foreign policy researcher at Sciences Pos in Paris, said Beijing's main goal was to promote a political solution that cast Washington's dogged military support for Israel in an unfavourable light.\n\n\"The idea is to pose as a respectable, responsible superpower, and to denigrate the US,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a lot of rhetoric, it's a show of diplomacy ... but in the middle and long term, I'm more sceptical over whether it will solve the Israel-Palestine conflict.\"", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This agreement was brokered by China, aiming to enhance its position as a global mediator.\n\nAccording to a copy of the document seen by NBC News, the statement outlines the formation of an interim \"national unity government\" overseeing the West Bank, Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, with plans to eventually hold elections. Leaders from the factions committed to a roadmap for achieving unity after three days of discussions in Beijing. It also emphasizes resistance to displacement efforts in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem, and denounces settlement expansion as illegal under international law.\n\nFollowing the talks, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the event as a \"historic moment for the cause of Palestine's liberation.\" He emphasized a consensus on forming an interim national reconciliation government to manage Gaza post-conflict and reiterated China's support for a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire. Wang also called for an international peace conference to advance a two-state solution.\n\nThe rivalry between Fatah and Hamas intensified after Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, leading to a power struggle with Fatah. This conflict culminated in violent clashes in 2007, resulting in Hamas taking control of the Gaza Strip while Fatah retained authority in the West Bank.

It also precedes by a couple of days, the resumption of talks on a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages, one of the stumbling block in Gaza for the \"day after\".\n\nThe Beijing agreement must be seen along with other talks related to the conflict that has been going on for more than nine months in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, Axios, a US-based news website, is reporting a secret summit between the United States, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last week.\n\nEarlier, an op-ed in the Financial Times inked by Emirati diplomat Lana Nusseibeh said that a temporary international mission could be deployed in Gaza to meet the humanitarian crisis, restore law and order, and lay the foundations for governance.\n\nThe UAE would be prepared to send its troops, but on condition that the international mission acts at the formal invitation of the Palestinian National Authority.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has always rejected this possibility, but some sources suggest that he might give in under pressure from Washington.\n\nTwo very different and opposing scenarios are thus emerging from Beijing and Washington for the post-war period in Gaza.\n\nIt is noteworthy to point out that WAFA, the official Palestinian News Agency, reported the Beijing agreement between the Palestinian factions making no mention of who will rule Gaza.\n\nThis shows how confused the picture is and how the specific interests of the various mediators in the ongoing war in Gaza complicate the conflict rather than bring the parties closer to a solution.", "source": {"uri":

Central Committee, attends the closing meeting of a reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions and witnesses the signing of a declaration on ending division and strengthening unity by 14 Palestinian factions in Beijing, China, July 23, 2024. /Xinhua\n\nWorld leaders and experts welcomed the signing of a declaration by 14 Palestinian factions in Beijing and lauded China's role in promoting it.\n\nThe signing of the Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity is \"an additional positive step\" toward achieving Palestinian national unity and represents \"the ideal and most appropriate national solution\" for the Palestinian situation after the conflict, Hamas said on Tuesday.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \"very much welcomes the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the Palestinian factions,\" said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN chief, in response to questions at a regular daily briefing on Tuesday.\n\nTerming the deal as \"an important step towards furthering Palestinian unity,\" Dujarric said the secretary-general \"encourages all factions to overcome their differences through dialogue and urges them to follow up on the commitments that were made in Beijing and the declaration they signed on to.\"\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that uniting the various Palestinian factions under the Beijing Declaration is a crucial step toward realizing the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n\"It is my sincere hope that this declaration of unity will translate into tangible results on the ground and withstand future challenges,\" he said.\n\nThe talks in Beijing involved 14 Palestinian factions, with all their positions balanced, thus constituting a basis for ending the division, said Abdel Mohdy Motawe, a Cairo-based researcher and executive director of the Middle East Forum for Strategic Studies and National Security.\n\nIt is an important step toward ending the division and strengthening national unity within the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, with the inclusion of all Palestinian forces and factions in its institutions, said Abu Bakr Al-Deeb, an advisor to the Cairo-based Arab Center for Research and Studies.\n\nWorld leaders and experts also lauded China's sincere effort to support the rights of the Palestinians, end division and bring about a unified position among the Palestinian factions.\n\nIn a statement, Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas's political bureau, expressed his \"high appreciation for the great efforts made by China to reach this declaration,\" noting that this announcement came at an important time, as Palestinians are facing an ongoing conflict, especially in the Gaza Strip.\n\nGuterres expressed his appreciation for the diplomatic efforts being made by China as well as the efforts of other countries involved in facilitating the process, said Dujarric, the UN spokesman.\n\nThe signing of the declaration represents an \"overwhelming success of Chinese diplomacy,\" its effectiveness, and China's desire for rapprochement with the Middle East region and support of Arab issues, with the Palestinian issue as a priority, said Al-Deeb.\n\nIt underscores China's growing diplomatic prowess and increasingly respected and influential role in the Middle East, demonstrating its capability to generate effective solutions, said Baris Doster, an academic with the Istanbul-based Marmara University.\n\nAs one of the few countries that pursue the principle of dialogue, talks and positive steps to heal the rift in the Middle East, China is expected to have a greater and broader role in the Palestinian issue and other Arab issues, said Motawe.", "source":

China's invitation, which began on Sunday, China's Foreign Ministry said.\n\n\"It brings precious hope for the Palestinian people who have suffered for too long,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference, \"and stresses the need to hold, under the auspices of the UN, an international conference with a full mandate and broad-based participation from the region and beyond.\"\n\nNing said that according to the declaration, \"parties believe that the Beijing talks demonstrated a positive and constructive spirit, and agree to realize national unity among all factions under the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nShe explained that Foreign Minister Wang Yi put forward China's three-step initiative regarding the ongoing Gaza conflict.\n\nThe first step was aimed at \"achieving comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, and ensuring unimpeded access to humanitarian aid and rescue on the ground.\"\n\nThe second step was \"making joint efforts toward post-conflict governance of Gaza under the principle of 'the Palestinians governing Palestine'.\"\n\n'Red Line of Modern Civilization' Crossed - Chinese Foreign Minister Calls for Immediate Ceasefire\n\n\"These three steps are interlocked and all of them are indispensable,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to Palestinian sources, the factions, which include Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) and Fatah, agreed to the following:\n\n-Welcoming the opinion of the International Court of Justice, \"which confirmed the illegality of presence, occupation, and settlement\"\n\n- Continuing to \"follow up on the implementation of the agreements to end the division that took place with the help of Egypt, Algeria, China, and Russia\"\n\n- Committing to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state \"with its capital in Al-Quds (Jerusalem) in accordance with international resolutions, especially 181 and 2334, and ensuring the right of return\".\n\n- Affirming \"the right of the Palestinian people to resist occupation and end it in accordance with international laws, the UN Charter, and the right of peoples to self-determination\"\n\n- Forming \"a temporary national unity government with the consensus of Palestinian factions and by a decision of the president based on the Palestinian Basic Law\"\n\n- The formed government \"exercises its powers and authorities over all Palestinian territories, confirming the unity of the West Bank, Al-Quds, and the Gaza Strip\"\n\n- To \"resist and thwart attempts to displace our people from their homeland, especially from the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and Al-Quds\"\n\n- \"Working to lift the barbaric siege on our people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and deliver humanitarian and medical aid without restriction or condition.\"\n\n\"These are historic moments,\" senior Hamas official, Dr Mousa Abu Marzouk, who was present at the talks, said.\n\n\"We will remain determined to liberate our land and ensure the return of our people.\"\n\nHe emphasized that Palestine \"and its cause have reached international courts, thanks to the struggle and sacrifices\" of the Palestinian people.\n\n\"We are active on all fronts to protect our people and stop the aggression against them, and we will exert all efforts to stop the massacres and aggression,\" he added.\n\nAbu Marzouk thanked China for its \"efforts\" as well as \"everyone who has stood with us\" including Hezbollah, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Qatar, Turkey and Egypt.\n\nIn April, representatives of Hamas and Fatah held talks in Beijing wherein they had \"fully expressed their political will to achieve reconciliation through dialogue and consultation and explored a number of specific issues, with positive progress being made,\" according to China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian.\n\nReacting to the news, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz slammed the news, saying

Top American officials, including President Biden's key Middle East advisor Brett McGurk (pictured left) and State Department counselor Tom Sullivan attended from the US side, Axios reports citing Israeli sources.\n\nThe gathering in Abu Dhabi on Thursday stands in stark contrast to a meeting hosted by China two days earlier, which saw Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas sign an agreement with Hamas officials to set up an 'interim national reconciliation government' in post-war Gaza. While the conclusion of the US meeting with Israeli and UAE officials is unclear, neither Washington nor Tel Aviv would sanction any post-war plan that includes Hamas, who they see as a terrorist organisation. The two very different meetings underline how far removed, and perhaps irreconcilable, the two sides' positions are as it stands, as the war rumbles on and casualties continue to mount in the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed that his forces will continue fighting until Hamas is completely eradicated, even amid international pressure to agree a ceasefire. But the secretive gathering suggests a growing understanding within the Israeli government that a realistic plan is needed for how Gaza might be governed after the war. It comes after the UAE signalled last week that it is willing to send forces to Gaza as part of a multinational 'stabilisation' mission after the war is brought to an end.\n\nComments made by Lana Nusseibeh, special envoy to the UAE foreign ministry, the day before the meeting suggest the Gulf State is prepared to be the first nation to deploy boots in the ground following the Israeli offensive if strict conditions are met. 'The UAE could consider being part of the stabilisation forces alongside Arab and international partners... at the invitation of a reformed PA, or a PA led by an empowered prime minister,' Nusseibeh said. She added that 'the United States should have the lead on this for it to succeed.' Nusseibeh further said that Abu Dhabi had, 'and continued to have, conversations on the \"day after\" with all the concerned actors in the region'. The development comes the West, Arab states and China are wrangling to devise a viable post-war plan for Gaza and present themselves as leading on the brokering of a potential deal.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups in Beijing on Tuesday. He said they had agreed to set up an 'interim national reconciliation government' to govern post-war Gaza, which was backed by China. 'Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. 'We are committed to national unity and we call for it,' Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nThe war, which has been raging for nine months, was sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures. The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead. Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank. China, Wang said, was keen to 'play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East'.\n\nHe also called for a 'comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire', as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN. But in another show of discord between the warring sides, and a sign that the deal is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact, Israel quickly condemned it.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz (pictured) slammed Abbas for engaging with Hamas, writing on X: 'Hamas and Fatah signed an agreement in China for joint control of Gaza after the war. 'Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. 'In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' s rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,' he added.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Several reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.\n\nChina hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed. China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. China has positioned itself as a more neutral actor on the Israel-Palestinian conflict than its rival the United States, advocating for a two-state solution while also maintaining good ties with Israel.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

For China's leader Xi Jinping, this is an opportunity to place his country and leadership as a positive force in global governance and conflict resolution -- something the United States (US) is markedly failing at.\n\nChina's perceived success as a mediating and reconciliatory power in the Middle East (West Asia), in the way of helping negotiate d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia, seems to have given Beijing a boost on what kind of role it can further play.\n\nAs Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took off from Tel Aviv for his trip to the US, a first since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began in October 2023, 14 Palestinian factions and groups, including Hamas, Fatah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) -- both Hamas and PIJ are listed terror groups by multiple countries -- congregated in China's capital Beijing. Even though these talks were widely reported, the larger modalities of this engagement were kept under lock-and-key until China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi's photo-op and statement with the attendees was released.\n\nWang instilled strong support behind this 'new' reconciliation drive. He highlighted three major points that China views as being critical towards any resolution of the ongoing war. First, smooth entry of humanitarian aid and a plan for post-war reconstruction. Second, centrality of the principle of 'Palestinians ruling Palestinians'. And, finally, implementation of the two-state solution and Palestine's entry into the United Nations. The former includes the recognition of Israel by those who still have not done so till now, which is a contentious ask by itself.\n\nThe two-day long meeting seems to have offered some dividends. According to a reported joint statement released at the end of the deliberations, the Palestinian groups \"agreed on achieving a comprehensive national unity that includes all Palestinian factions within the frame of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).\" Within the representing Palestinian grouping, the vast differences between Hamas and Fatah hold court. How these differences seem to have been ironed out, if at all, is unclear. In June 2007, both Hamas and Fatah fought a civil war after the latter lost the legislative elections in 2006. The win for Hamas's 'Change and Reform' tickets was not just unpalatable to Fatah but, perhaps, even a shock to most other regional and international actors.\n\nAccording to a reported joint statement released at the end of the deliberations, the Palestinian groups \"agreed on achieving a comprehensive national unity that includes all Palestinian factions within the frame of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).\"\n\nHowever, while the issue of intra-Palestine conflicts of interests is not new, it is the entry of China as a perceived peacemaker and the political isolation which Hamas finds itself in in the aftermath of the October 8 terror attacks, that has, in large part, driven such an engagement forward. For Beijing, hosting these Palestinian groups is not a first. The previous meeting between Fatah and Hamas hosted by the Chinese government took place only recently in April. But for China, engagement with the likes of Hamas, Fatah, PIJ, and others, comes from its long-standing wish to be seen as a great power, but one which is non-interventionist, and stands for peace and reconciliation.\n\nThis is China placing itself as the antithesis to the US in particular, and the West in general. It has repeatedly raked up the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as examples of military-based policies to deeper political problems. China's Special Envoy for the Middle East, Zhai Jun, was very active in the days after the October 8 attacks. Zhai made calls across the board to both regional leaders and those from the Global South, calling for a two-state solution, and an immediate end to hostilities from all sides. On 14 October 14 2023, Wang, talking to his counterpart in Saudi Arabia, criticised Israeli retaliation, demanded a stop to its \"group punishment\", and highlighted the \"historical injustice\" against Palestine which cannot go on any longer. This position is reiterated to this day.\n\nThis increasingly vocal stance, and the willingness to take difficult decisions over mediation, does provide Beijing good headlines in the international arena. This is particularly true in the Muslim world and the Global South. However, China's willingness to be engaged in the Middle East remains strategically distant. A failure of this version of Palestinian reconciliation will not cost Beijing too much. The blame for such a fall will come squarely on the Palestinian factions. It will, however, strengthen its position amidst the Arab world further. For a long while now, China's policy for the region has been 'we do what the Arabs want'. This is further substantiated by the fact that, despite the attempts to maintain balance, Beijing did not have much of a problem setting its bilateral with Israel ablaze. China having not condemned Hamas by name yet is a cornerstone of this dissolution. In the long term, China's calculations come from its position within the ensuing great power competition with the US.\n\nThis increasingly vocal stance, and the willingness to take difficult decisions over mediation, does provide Beijing good headlines in the international arena. This is particularly true in the Muslim world and the Global South.\n\nToday, the view is, China is helping to build a Palestinian peace consensus while US provides Netanyahu with all the weapons needed to flatten Gaza. The fact that over the past months Hamas has managed to gain significant victories in the battle for narratives, despite still holding dozens of Israelis hostage, helps the militant group during its fragile political state within Palestinian society in Gaza. Hamas leaders know, that if they do not recover politically, at any cost, they are destined to be a disbanded and lost organisation of the past.\n\nChina continues to have limited leverages in the Middle East. Its outreach to the likes of the Taliban, Hamas, Hezbollah, amongst others, also puts it in a precarious bracket internationally. In part, Beijing hopes a clear stance on issues such as Gaza would garner it more support within the Global South, a loosely tied together grouping which is increasingly powerful, but also fragmenting, as a bi-polar order led by the US-China rivalry sets in. For the moment, China can, and will, bask in the light of getting the Palestinian factions to come to an agreement, albeit on paper, to cooperate. But is Beijing willing to commit deeply to the security of this region? Is it willing to be a guarantor both strategically and tactically? The answer for these tough questions, in all probability for now, remains a no.\n\nKabir Taneja is a Fellow with the Strategic Studies Programme at the Observer Research Foundation.\n\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

Representatives of Fatah and Hamas had held a dialogue in April in Beijing on promoting intra-Palestinian reconciliation.\n\nThe talks, which were organized and coordinated by China, also highlighted the country's role as a trustworthy peace broker, analysts said.\n\nThe declaration proposes hosting an international conference with broad participation and full authority. It also calls for achieving comprehensive national unity, which would include all Palestinian factions within the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nForeign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday at the talks' closing ceremony that the most important consensus reached in the talks was for the reconciliation and unity of the 14 factions, with the core outcome being that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people.\n\nWang said that a highlight of the talks was an agreement on post-Gaza conflict governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government. He added that the talks voiced a strong call for realizing the independent statehood of Palestine in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions.\n\nCalls for internal reconciliation have been growing since the outbreak of the latest Palestinian-Israeli conflict in October, a prolonged conflict that has brought chaos and disaster to the Middle East.\n\nCalling the Palestinian issue the core issue of the Middle East, Wang said that China has no selfish interests in the issue and remains a staunch advocate of justice and fairness.\n\nWang called for a comprehensive, lasting and sustainable cease-fire to ensure access to and implementation of humanitarian assistance, and emphasized upholding the principle of \"Palestinians governing Palestine \"in Gaza's postwar reconstruction.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of full membership for Palestine at the UN and the implementation of the two-state solution.\n\nMahmoud al-Aloul, deputy chief of Fatah, and Mousa Abu Marzouk, who represented the Hamas delegation, both expressed appreciation to China for supporting and helping Palestine, as well as for the country's efforts to uphold justice for Palestine in the international community.\n\nLiu Zhongmin, a professor of Middle East studies at Shanghai International Studies University, said that the talks and the ensuing declaration play a crucial role in forming a unified voice and stance within Palestine, which is an essential step toward the settlement of the Palestinian issue and the realization of peace and stability in the Middle East.\n\nThe complexity of the Palestinian issue has long been reflected not only in the conflict with Israel, but also in internal divisions, particularly the long-standing conflict between Hamas and Fatah, Liu said.\n\nThe internal division has hindered the implementation of the two-state solution and the progress of peace talks between Palestine and Israel, he said, adding that the latest reconciliation talks are conducive to creating conditions for the resumption of Palestine-Israel negotiations.\n\nMore talks and specific arrangements are required to consolidate consensus and resolve internal differences in Palestine, Liu said.\n\nThe fair and just stance of China in its Middle East policy, along with its traditional friendships with various parties, enabled Beijing to act as a mediator, he added.\n\nYu Guoqing, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of West-Asian and African Studies, said that promoting reconciliation among Palestinian factions is another significant endeavor by China to advance peace and stability in the Middle East, following Beijing's successful diplomatic mediation for the reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\nDespite the ongoing conflict in Gaza, China managed to gather representatives from 14 Palestinian factions from different countries and regions to Beijing for talks, which shows the country's responsibility as a major country, he said.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the deal, finalized on Tuesday in China after three days of intensive talks, lays the groundwork for an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to rule post-war Gaza. The agreement was signed by long-term rivals Hamas and Fatah, as well as 12 other Palestinian groups.\n\nChina has elevated its stature in the comity of nations for strongly establishing its credentials as a peace broker, a strategy, which is in sharp contrast to the policy of use of force against smaller nations, regime change and imposition of military and economic sanctions adopted by some world powers. Instead of fuelling conflicts to create markets for its arms industry, China has all along been striving to promote regional and global peace and is diplomatically active to promote reconciliation between rival parties. It received applauds from the peace-loving members of the world community by brokering a deal between long time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, presented a 12-point proposal to end the Russia-Ukraine war and now scored another diplomatic victory by bringing all Palestinian factions together. There can be no two opinions that internal feud was one of the major factors behind sufferings and troubles of the people of Palestine. It is understood that the prevailing pathetic situation forced them to come to the negotiating table and agree on a future roadmap in the face of existential threat at the hands of the Jewish state. After turning the entire Gaza territory into rubles, Israel is insisting on retaining control of the area, a situation that has sensitized Palestinian groups to forget their petty differences and forge unity to foil designs of their common enemy. No doubt, unity accords were also signed in the past but the latest one is more comprehensive as it seeks the establishment of an interim national unity government, the formation of unified Palestinian leadership ahead of future elections, the free election of a new Palestinian National Council, and a general declaration of unity in the face of ongoing Israeli attacks. Mustafa Barghouti, Secretary-General of the Palestinian National Initiative, one of the 14 factions to sign the accord, pointed out that the move towards a unity government is especially important because it \"blocks Israeli efforts to create some sort of collaborative structure against Palestinian interests\". Following the signing of what has been referred to as the \"Beijing Declaration\", China's Wang said: \"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community.\" China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Wang restated China's support for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable cease-fire\" and for the convening of a large \"international peace conference\" to work toward a two-state solution. Israel has understandably opposed the deal as it could pose a serious challenge to its future plans and commentators in some Western countries have downplayed the peace-making efforts of China and its role in the Middle-East conflict. However, it is hoped that in view of attempts being made to physically decimate Palestinians, all factions would maintain unity in their ranks as this is the only viable option to foil Israeli designs. Those downplaying the latest peace accord also expressed pessimism about the success of the peace deal between KSA and Iran but the two sides are moving ahead to mend their differences and promote cordial relations. We hope China will continue to encourage Palestinian groups to build upon the accord for their own interest.", "source": {"uri": "pakobserver.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pakistan Observer"},

China has been and will continue to make relentless effort to this end. -- Mao Ning, China's Foreign Ministry Spokesman\n\nChina has brought together 14 disparate Palestinian groups and helped them form a unity government that will rule Gaza when the Israeli onslaught ends.\n\nOn Tuesday, leaders of the main Palestinian factions -- including Hamas and Fatah -- signed the Beijing Declaration which establishes an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to rule post-war Gaza.\n\nThe groundbreaking agreement represents the first step towards rapprochement between traditional rivals who have put their differences behind them in the interests of the beleaguered Palestinian people.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (C), also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, poses for a group picture with members of the Palestinian factions during the signing of the Beijing Declaration in Beijing, China, July 23, 2024. Credit: Chinese Foreign Ministry\n\nIn order to capitalize on the progress they've made in Beijing, Palestinian leaders need to call a broad and fully authorized international conference under the auspices of the UN, with regional and international participation.\"\n\nBy doing this, they will draw more attention to their decades-long struggle for self-determination, which is already gaining momentum due to Israel's genocidal rampage in Gaza. With the establishment of a de facto national unity government, the Palestinians will also be in a position to request international peacekeepers to protect their legal (1967) borders, which Israel fails to recognize, and which are the source of the ongoing dispute. In order for international law to have any meaning, UN resolutions must be enforceable. Thus, the legitimacy of the United Nations depends largely on its ability to establish and defend a Palestinian state against Zionist aggression. This is from an article at the Global Times:\n\nChina has made another significant contribution to the peace and stability of a world in turbulence as 14 factions from Palestine, including Fatah and Hamas, with key support from China, reached a historic declaration for nationwide reconciliation in Beijing on Tuesday. Experts said it will be a key step for Palestinian people to achieve their goal of establishing a state and the realization of long-standing peace between Palestine and Israel....\n\nThe latest.... events on the Palestine issue and the Ukraine crisis prove that China, which always upholds its stance for peace... is taking concrete actions to contribute to political settlements, despite the US and US-led military alliances like NATO continuing to add uncertainties and obstacles. China will continue with its efforts to ensure that peace processes in different regions of the world can be delivered...\n\nHistoric declaration for Palestine...\n\nThe core outcome of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions held in Beijing is to specify that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday....\n\nMa Xiaolin, dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the declaration is absolutely historic, significant and unprecedented.... (it) is not just a document, but a feasible roadmap with international support and supervision from not only major regional countries but permanent members of the UN Security Council.\"... Global Times\n\nChinese diplomats expect the path to peace to be implemented in three phases:\n\nPhase 1 -- \"To achieve a comprehensive, lasting and sustainable cease-fire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, and ensure access to humanitarian aid and rescue on the ground.\" Phase 2 -- \"To make joint efforts toward post-conflict governance of Gaza under the principle of \"Palestinians governing Palestine.\"\u2002Gaza is an inseparable, integral part of Palestine. Phase 3 -- \"To help Palestine become a full member state of the UN and get down to implementing the two-state solution.\"\n\nChina should be applauded for bringing the rival factions together and making such a courageous effort to bring the 10 month-long bloodbath in Gaza to an end. They should also be commended for understanding that the broader crisis cannot be resolved without internal reconciliation, which is why China's foreign ministry arranged to bring all the factions together at one time. Fortunately, the three-day confab helped the leaders to iron-out their differences on key issues including the creation of a provisional \"national reconciliation government that will be formed according to the consensus of Palestinian factions and the current Basic Law of the Palestine.\"\n\nThis is a remarkable achievement for China which has already distinguished itself as the world leader in promoting policies of peace and non-intervention. Keep in mind, that China recently helped to reestablish diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia and, also, has made numerous efforts to mediate an end to the war in Ukraine. Wherever hotspots emerge and fighting breaks out, China can be found dousing the flames and trying to bring the opposing-sides to the negotiating table. And while their actions may be ignored by the western media, they are having an impact all the same.\n\nThe world needs an actively engaged China to offset the destabilizing effects of Washington's endless coups, interventions and wars. The Beijing Declaration shows what progress can be made when right-minded leaders act in the interests of peace and conflict resolution.\n\nBravo, China.\n\n*\n\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Twelve smaller Palestinian factions also signed the deal.\n\nThe summit was hosted and brokered by China, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi present for the talks. \"An agreement has been reached on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government,\" Wang stated.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, Hamas's political leader, and Mahmoud al-Aloul, the deputy head of Fatah, both took part in the talks. Haniyeh's presence is especially noteworthy as he was one of those issued an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in May along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Beijing is not party to the ICC.\n\nThe unity deal contains four main parts: the creation of a provisional unity government, the establishment of a unified Palestinian leadership before the next legislative election, a free and fair legislative election, and a declaration of unity in the midst of the current conflict.\n\nThe agreement is aimed at preserving Palestinian rule in Gaza following the current conflict, precluding any separate deal whereby a single faction would work with Israel.\n\nHamas and Fatah, though historically rivals, have signed unity agreements in the past at Cairo in 2011 and at Algiers in 2022, though neither agreement was ever implemented.\n\nIt is unclear what immediate effect the scheme has, or whether it will be implemented. Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz released a statement following the deal saying that \"in reality this [joint control of Gaza and the West Bank] won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar.\"", "source": {"uri": "theamericanconservative.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Conservative"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mason_letteau_stallings@theamericanconservative.com", "name": "Mason Letteau Stallings", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algiers"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Algiers"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162475274-scaled-e1721835704950.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

which have expanded dramatically since Oslo - and see the return of those ethnically cleansed from their homes and lands in the 1947-49 Nakba.\n\nLittle surprise then that the US almost instantly rejected the Beijing Declaration, with State Department spokesman Matt Miller saying: \"We made clear we want to see the Palestinian Authority\" with a governing role in Gaza, \"but no, we do not want to see a role for Hamas.\"\n\nThe US position remains pivotal to Abbas.\n\nWhile the EU is the largest donor to the Palestinian Authority, the US dominates funding and training for the PA's security apparatus, specifically set up to \"coordinate\" with the Israeli military.\n\nThe PLO's exclusively diplomatic strategy has been long buried under the ceaseless expansion of illegal Israeli settlements. But the PA has insisted to continue its always unpopular security \"coordination\" with Israel - in effect an outsourcing of Israel's occupation to Ramallah.\n\nAbbas' popularity, never high, has nose dived as a result of both the strategic failure and the security coordination.\n\nPoll after poll finds Abbas losing to any and all feasible candidates in theoretical elections - presidential terms under Palestinian law should be no longer than five years, but Abbas has not faced any vote since 2005 and has ruled largely by presidential decree for 14 years.\n\nIn the latest poll from the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, published on 10 July, a full 89 percent of respondents said they wanted Abbas to resign. More than 60 percent support the dissolution of the PA.\n\nIn the last poll the question was asked, in March 2023, 63 percent said they wanted an end to all security coordination with Israel.\n\nIn other words, shorn of popular, political and legal legitimacy, Abbas depends for his continued rule on his security forces. These, in turn, have increasingly clamped down on domestic dissent, even before 7 October, and with ever-growing violence.\n\nThis reliance on the security forces translates into a direct reliance on Washington's good graces. Indeed, US leverage only grows, the weaker and more unpopular Abbas becomes.\n\nWashington's support for and complicity with Israel's genocide in Gaza - not to mention its rank incompetence in pretending it is engaged in any kind of constructive diplomacy - should preclude it from any future diplomatic role in Palestine.\n\nChina, which has been increasing its diplomatic and trading role in the region over several years, most notably by forging Saudi-Iranian rapprochement in 2023, is the only country with the financial, military and political clout to seriously challenge US monopoly over regional diplomacy.\n\nAnd while the Beijing agreement is almost certain to go the way of so many other attempts at reconciling Palestinian factions, it did underscore at least one area of significant agreement: A united rejection of any role for outsiders in a \"day-after\" scenario in Gaza.\n\nThis is perhaps a direct response to the United Arab Emirates maneuvering to insert itself into the Gaza equation, calling for a UAE-led \"temporary international mission\" in Gaza after a ceasefire.\n\nPalestinian factions might be equally united in opposing any UAE role because of the rumored involvement of Muhammad Dahlan. The erstwhile Fatah leader, now in exile in the UAE after falling out with Abbas, and who oversaw the failed attempt at removing Hamas from power in Gaza in 2007, months ago suggested a similar scenario.\n\nOr the rejection may simply be as a result of a realistic assessment of the record of the UAE's other foreign interventions in countries like Libya, Yemen, Egypt and others, none of which have resulted in any discernible success.\n\nNevertheless, it is a point of agreement that provides something to build on. And encouraging a growing role for Beijing and others might just offset Washington's outsized influence over diplomacy on Palestine.\n\nIndeed, the Beijing Declaration explicitly made this point, according to the leaked document published by al-Masry al-Youm. Commending China for its mediation efforts, the factions, according to the leaked agreement, pledged to work with international partners, specifically China and Russia, to \"end the Israeli occupation ... under the umbrella and auspices of the United Nations and with broad international and regional participation as an alternative to unilateral and biased American sponsorship.\"", "source": {"uri":

It emphasizes the need to convene a broad and fully authorized international conference under the auspices of the UN, with regional and international participation, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe dialogue in Beijing also demonstrated a positive and constructive spirit, agreeing to achieve comprehensive national unity under the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n\nIt calls for establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, based on relevant UN resolutions, maintaining the territorial integrity of Palestine, including the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Gaza.\n\nThe declaration also states that a temporary national reconciliation government will be formed according to the consensus of Palestinian factions and the current Basic Law of the Palestine, to undertake Gaza reconstruction and prepare for general elections as soon as possible in accordance with the adopted electoral law.\n\nIt also emphasizes taking practical steps to form a new national council according to adopted electoral law, unanimously agreeing to activate the temporary unified leadership framework and operate it institutionally for joint political decision-making, and establishing a collective mechanism to fully implement the declaration's provisions, with a clear timetable for implementation.\n\nAs Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated in his speech, the most important consensus of this dialogue is achieving grand reconciliation and unity among all 14 factions.

Experts said it will be one of key steps for the Palestinian people to achieve their goal of establishing a state and the realization of long-standing peace between Palestine and Israel.\n\nThe same day, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also kicked off his visit to China. At present, the two most serious hot spot issues and conflicts in the world - the Gaza conflict and the Ukraine crisis - are continually causing bloodshed for the local people and adding concerns to achieving global peace and recovery. It seems like China is now becoming a hot place for different countries who are suffering from chaos and wars around the globe to seek peaceful solutions, said some observers.\n\nThe latest and upcoming events on the Palestine issue and the Ukraine crisis prove that China, which always upholds its stance for peace, is not just talking the talk, but is taking concrete actions to contribute to political settlements, despite the US and US-led military alliances like NATO continuing to add uncertainties and obstacles. China will continue with its efforts to ensure that peace processes in different regions of the world can be delivered eventually, said analysts.\n\nHistoric declaration for Palestine\n\nAt the invitation of the Chinese side, high-level representatives of 14 Palestinian factions held a reconciliation dialogue in Beijing from Sunday to Tuesday, and the Palestinian factions inked the Beijing Declaration on ending division and strengthening unity, the Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nIt is the first time that 14 Palestinian factions have gathered in Beijing for a reconciliation dialogue, bringing precious hope to the suffering Palestinian people.\n\nThe core outcome of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions held in Beijing is to specify that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday.\n\nWang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remarks at the closing ceremony of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions. He also witnessed the signing of the declaration on ending division and strengthening unity by 14 Palestinian factions.\n\nWang pointed out that only when Palestinian factions speak as one can the voice of justice be loud and clear, and only when they join hands and march forward shoulder to shoulder can they succeed in their\u2002national liberation\u2002cause.\n\nMa Xiaolin, dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the declaration is absolutely historic, significant and unprecedented. First, in the past, the reconciliation dialogue held by major regional powers in the Middle East was just between Fatah and Hamas, but this time, China gathered together representatives of 14 factions, and this means the declaration has the greatest inclusiveness and legitimacy, and is one that is acceptable to all major political factions within Palestine.\n\n\"Second, it makes the reconciliation process of Palestine no longer merely regional affair, but an issue that matters to international peace under the international watch. Therefore, the declaration is not just a document, but a feasible roadmap with international support and supervision from not only regional major countries but permanent members of the UN Security Council,\" Ma said.\n\nThird, specifying that the PLO is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people means that all other factions, including Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, need to join or reunify with the PLO, so Palestine will be able to have new elections and deal with the outside world as a unified country, and this is important for the future of Palestine-Israel issue, Ma noted.\n\nAccording to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, diplomatic envoys to China or their representatives from\u2002Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Russia and Turkey\u2002as well as representatives from 14 main Palestinian factions attended the closing ceremony.\n\nRoad to peace\n\nWang said at the closing ceremony that \"To help get out of the current conflict and predicament, China proposes a three-step initiative: The first step is to achieve comprehensive, lasting and sustainable cease-fire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, and ensure access to humanitarian aid and rescue on the ground.\"\n\n\"The second step is to make joint efforts toward post-conflict governance of Gaza under the principle of 'Palestinians governing Palestine.'\u2002Gaza is an inseparable, integral part of Palestine.\"\n\n\"The third step is to help Palestine become a full member state of the UN and get down to implementing the two-state solution,\" the Chinese foreign minister said.\n\nLiu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the Beijing Declaration brings hope for peace in Gaza. Since the outbreak of the ongoing conflict in Gaza on October 7, 2023, people have suffered a lot of casualties, and the international community has been limited in helping end the disaster. Now the reconciliation within Palestine can lay the foundations for effective peace talks between Palestine and Israel.\n\nMa echoed that now is the time for Israel and the US to consider how to deal with Palestine as a whole, rather than treating different Palestinian factions separately.\n\nThe US is undergoing domestic turmoil in the wake of US President Joe Biden stepping down from the presidential race and the failed assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nThe international community, including US rivals, competitors and allies, are all very concerned about a potential change in US foreign strategy, and unfortunately, the US is still trying to hype bloc confrontations worldwide, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, experts said.\n\nApart from the peace hopes for Palestine, observers expect that top Ukrainian diplomat Kuleba's visit to China will see new achievements that could help bring about a peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis in the same way representatives from the 14 factions of Palestine achieved in Beijing on Tuesday. They also recalled that China previously successfully mediated the reestablishment of diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and are convinced that China will continue to play a significant role to restore peace and stability for the world in turbulence.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The crossing, when open, is typically operated by Hamas personnel from Gaza's side, as the political and armed organization governs the interior of the Strip.\n\n\"Israel wants people who aren't affiliated with Hamas to do it, but objects to any official involvement of the Palestinian Authority - mostly for domestic political reasons,\" Axios added.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority rejected a proposal that would involve it in reopening the crossing in any unofficial capacity, the publication said.\n\nThe meeting reportedly included White House official Brett McGurk, the head of Israel's domestic spying agency Ronen Bar, secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee Hussein al-Sheikh and head of the PA's military intelligence Majed Faraj.\n\nThis was the first time that Palestinian officials have met with US and Israeli counterparts \"to discuss the day after the war ends in Gaza,\" reported Barak Ravid, the Axios writer who is frequently fed information by Israel's military and intelligence apparatus.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates also appears eager to conspire for a day-after plan in Gaza.\n\nThe Gulf state, which formalized relations with Israel in 2020, is looking \"to deploy a temporary international mission\" in Gaza that would establish \"law and order,\" the UAE ambassador at the United Nations, Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, wrote in the Financial Times last week.\n\n\"A temporary international presence in Gaza can only result from a formal invitation from the Palestinian Authority,\" the ambassador wrote.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority was created in the early 1990s following the Oslo accords to act as native auxiliary on behalf of the Israeli occupation. It has performed that role - one that PA leader Mahmoud Abbas calls \"sacred\" - without interruption since day one.\n\nIt wouldn't be surpring if Israel and its Arab allies sought to copy this model in a post-genocide Gaza Strip.\n\nBut in order for Israel to execute its vision in the wrecked coastal enclave, the Israeli military would have to achieve its stated goal of eliminating Hamas as a governing and military presence in Gaza.\n\nThis doesn't appear close to happening.\n\nMeanwhile, Fatah and Hamas agreed to \"end the Palestinian national division\" after the rival factions held negotiations in China this month alongside other Palestinian political parties.\n\nNotably, the factions \"underlined the Palestinian people's right to resist occupation and to end it in accordance with international law,\" according to Lebanese broadcaster Al Mayadeen, which obtained a copy of the declaration.\n\nThis is not the first time that the parties have made these declarations, and there is no indication that this one will be different.\n\nA Palestinian Authority official said over the weekend that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of Palestinians.\n\n\"Leaked news indicating that Washington is discussing plans on the future of the Gaza Strip with some parties will not have any legitimacy and will not be accepted by the Palestinian people,\" Nabil Abu Rudeineh is paraphrased to have said, according to Wafa News Agency.\n\nFollowing an Israeli massacre in al-Mawasi earlier this month that killed at least 90 Palestinians and injured hundreds of others, the Palestinian Authority issued a statement effectively blaming Hamas for Israel's slaughter.\n\n\"The presidency sees that by escaping national unity, and providing free pretexts to the occupation state, the Hamas movement is a partner in bearing legal, moral and political responsibility for the continuation of the Israeli war of genocide,\" PA leader Mahmoud Abbas wrote in a statement.\n\nAnother PA official actually used an Israeli propaganda talking point against Hamas.\n\n\"Hamas is actually hiding between the residents to protect and save itself,\" PA official Munir al-Jaghoub reportedly said.\n\n\"If Hamas wanted to fight face-to-face with Israel, it would've done so in areas where the army is located, and not in places where there are people.\"\n\nWe were joined by writer and Birzeit University lecturer Abdaljawad Omar on 17 July on The Electronic Intifada livestream to talk about the situation in the West Bank.\n\nOmar said that the Palestinian Authority \"is trying to echo Israeli psychological warfare.\"\n\nIt is doing so \"by attempting to kind of de-link the Palestinian society overall from its resistance, and serving through this severance, serving Israeli war aims, which is to defeat the resistance and render Gaza unlivable.\"\n\n\"Not an authority or a governance structure like the one that Gaza had at least before 7 October,\" Omar added, which binded armed resistance with the party governing the interior affairs of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority is \"most responsible for the continuation of war, for empowering Israel to think that it can defeat the Palestinian people,\" Omar added, by producing \"this docile, ineffective, corrupt leadership that is running now the West Bank.\"\n\nThe successes of multiple factions of Palestinian resistance forces on the ground in Gaza are agitating the collaborationist body in Ramallah, Omar suggested, pointing to how the Palestinian Authority did not rise to the occasion following the Hamas operation of 7 October.\n\n\"The national challenge that has been opened on 7 October,\" is for the Palestinian Authority \"to actually participate and attempt, at least, to the best of its capacity to not allow Gaza to go through this war alone,\" Omar said.\n\nNot only did the Palestinian Authority abandon Gaza, he added, but it must be blamed \"for even the continuation of the war.\"\n\nThe elite of the collaborationist PA and the comprador class in Ramallah \"is betraying the nation in the name of the nation,\" Omar said.\n\n\"This elite has extreme anxiety over Hamas and Islamic Jihad and all the recent resistance groups in Gaza, coming out with significant strategic results from this war.\"\n\nOmar said he would confine the description of a \"third intifada\" to specific areas.\n\n\"I would confine it geographically to the north of the West Bank. So the areas that surround or go from the Jordan Valley upwards to Tubas, Tulkarem, Nablus, Jenin,\" Omar said.\n\n\"These are the areas that have active militant formations that are engaging in the buildup of [improvised explosive devices], the capacity to resist, and refining tactics,\" Omar said, making \"it hard for the Israelis to enter freely into these areas.\"\n\nIsrael responded with devastating revenge on entire communities where resistance emerges from, wreaking widespread devastation, severely damaging electricity networks, water and sewage infrastructure, uprooting roads and destroying homes.\n\nMore than 550 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank since 7 October, including at least 539 by Israeli forces, according to UN monitoring group OCHA.\n\nIsraeli settlers have killed at least 10 Palestinians, and another seven were killed by either Israeli army or settler fire.\n\nOf those killed in the occupied West Bank since 7 October, 138 were children.\n\nBut the \"Israelis have not been able to really shock that resistance into a place where it's defeated or raises the white flag,\" Omar said.\n\nOn the contrary, \"the resistance has been able to actually develop, evolve and and ensure that its defensive posture, or offensive posture has become more deadly for the Israeli forces entering the area.\"\n\nWatch the full interview with

On Tuesday morning, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended and addressed the closing session of the talks. The Palestinian factions signed the Beijing declaration on ending division and strengthening Palestinian national unity.\n\n\"This is the first time that all 14 Palestinian factions gathered in Beijing and held talks for reconciliation. It brings precious hope for the Palestinian people who have suffered for too long,\" Chinese FM spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"The declaration commends China's sincere effort to support the rights of the Palestinians, end division and bring about a unified position among the Palestinian factions.The declaration stresses the need to hold, under the auspices of the UN, an international conference with a full mandate and broad-based participation from the region and beyond,\" she remarked.\n\nAccording to the declaration, parties believe that the Beijing talks demonstrated a positive and constructive spirit, and agree to realize national unity among all factions under the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, she introduced.\n\n\"The declaration reaffirms commitment to establishing an independent State of Palestine with Jerusalem as the capital city based on relevant UN resolutions and ensuring the integrity of Palestinian territory including the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza. Parties are ready to, in line with the consensus of Palestinian factions and the existing basic law of Palestine, establish an interim national reconciliation government, carry out reconstruction in Gaza and prepare and hold a general election as soon as possible in accordance with the adopted election laws.\", she said..\n\nParties stressed the need to take practical steps to form a new Palestinian national council in line with the adopted election laws. Parties unanimously agreed to activate the provisional Unified Leadership framework which will function institutionally, and jointly carry out political decision-making. Parties agreed to set up a collective mechanism to fully implement the provisions of the declaration and create a timetable for the implementation process, she added.\n\n\"As Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his remarks, the most important consensus of the talks is to achieve reconciliation and unity among all 14 factions, the most central outcome is the reaffirmation of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, the most outstanding highlight is the consensus on post-conflict governance in Gaza and forming an interim national reconciliation government, and the strongest aspiration is to realize true independent statehood of Palestine in accordance with relevant UN resolutions,\" the spokesperson added.\n\n\"In his remarks, Foreign Minister Wang Yi put forward China's three-step initiative regarding the ongoing Gaza conflict. First step: achieving comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, and ensuring unimpeded access to humanitarian aid and rescue on the ground. Second step: making joint efforts toward post-conflict governance of Gaza under the principle of 'the Palestinians governing Palestine' Third step: making Palestine a full UN member state and beginning to implement the two-State solution. These three steps are interlocked and all of them are indispensable,\" Mao added.\n\n\"China and Palestine are each other's trusted brothers and partners. China looks forward to the day when Palestinian factions achieve internal reconciliation and, on that basis, realize national unity and independent statehood as early as possible. We will continue to work relentlessly to this end with the relevant parties,\" the spokesperson concluded.", "source": {"uri": "ecns.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China News \u4e2d\u56fd\u65b0\u95fb\u7f51"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mao Zedong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member states of the United Nations"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Moreover, the diplomatic coup has further strengthened China's image as a peacemaker in the strife-torn Middle East, succeeding where many other foreign powers have often failed. Fourteen Palestinian factions signed the declaration, with Hamas and Fatah being the most prominent of them. The former controls Gaza, while the latter runs the occupied West Bank through the Palestinian Authority. Both parties have been bitter rivals since a violent power struggle erupted in 2007. The Beijing Declaration seeks the formation of a unity government and the achievement of \"Palestinian independence at an early date\". Of course, standing in the way of these noble aims is Israel, which is furious with Beijing for inviting Hamas to the talks. Also, the Israeli parliament recently passed a bill rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state, effectively telling the world Tel Aviv has no intention of vacating the occupied territories.\n\nThe idea of a unity government is a much better 'day after' plan than the questionable schemes being dreamt up by Israel, the US and some Arab states. These include the presence of foreign 'peacekeepers' in Gaza. Numerous Palestinian factions have said they will not accept foreign troops on their land. Yet the fact remains that the unity government can only be formed once the slaughter in Gaza stops. Instead of foreign powers dictating their future, or worse, Israel installing loyalist puppets to police the Palestinians, the people of Palestine must be free to decide their own future through democratic means. And once the conditions for elections are established, the international community, as well as the Palestinian factions themselves, should respect the winning party's mandate. As for Beijing's growing role in the Middle East, this is China's second major accomplishment after last year's Iran-Saudi rapprochement. Perhaps China has succeeded as it does not bring with it the baggage of being an ex-colonial overlord in the region, while Beijing does not promise 'ironclad' support to an occupying power. The uniting of Palestinian factions in Beijing is another indication of a changing world order, where new global players are emerging to challenge the hegemony of the old order.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzerainty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suzerainty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hegemony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacekeeping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

This was due to Israel's indiscriminate attacks on the Gaza region in Palestine, which killed up to 39,000 civilians.\n\nThere is no indication yet that this conflict will be resolved. However, a number of global stakeholders are still trying to create peace in the region.\n\nThe Chinese government has again made a strong statement against Israel, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference of the Chinese Foreign Ministry (Kemenlu) on Monday (22/7/2024).\n\nIn his official statement, Mao mentioned the Chinese opinion of the counselor of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), according to which Israel's illegal annexation of Palestinian territories was an important step in the conflict between the two countries. According to him, this statement validates the world's assumption that Israel has indeed violated international rules.\n\n\"This statement responds to the widespread concerns and expectations of the international community and clearly shows that Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territories constitutes a violation of international law,\" he stressed.\n\n\"Israel is obliged to end its illegal presence in the occupied Palestinian territories as soon as possible.\"\n\nMao added that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has attracted great international attention. Therefore, as a world power, China is actively participating in the process of abiding by relevant international rules.\n\n\"We will continue to play a constructive role in international law-related affairs and take concrete measures to uphold international fairness and justice and promote progress toward the supremacy of international law,\" he added.\n\nThe two strongest Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, finally agreed to make peace by signing an agreement in China calling for \"national unity\" on Tuesday (23/7/2024).\n\nSenior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk announced that his militant organization had signed agreements with other Palestinian groups, including its rival Fatah, during a visit to China.\n\n\"Today we signed an agreement for national unity and we said that the way to complete this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said, as reported by AFP.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi welcomed the agreement by 14 Palestinian factions to form an \"interim government of national reconciliation\" to rule Gaza after the war.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters drove Fatah out of the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's landslide victory in 2006 elections.\n\nThe Islamic movement Hamas has controlled Gaza since taking control in 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, the secular Fatah movement controls the Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial administrative control over the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Israeli parliament (Knesset) on Monday (22/7/2024) gave initial approval to a bill (RUU) declaring the United Nations aid organization for Palestine, UNRWA, a terrorist organization. This came as Tel Aviv accused the agency's agents of collaborating with Hamas to attack Israel.\n\nIn a statement to the Knesset Information Service, the bill was approved in its first discussion and will be sent to the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee for further debate. The bill's sponsor, Yulia Malinovsky, described UNRWA as the fifth column on Israel's list of terrorist organizations.\n\n\"The bill, supported by 42 Knesset members and six opposed, stipulates that the 'anti-terrorism law' applies to UNRWA, and that all communications and relations between Israel and its citizens and UNRWA must cease,\" said the Palestinian media outlet, WAFA.\n\nIn response to the bill, UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma said it was a step by Israel toward dissolving the UN institution. This is the first time in history that a UN agency has been labeled a terrorist organization.\n\n\"This is another attempt in a broader campaign to dissolve the body. Such measures have never taken place in the history of the UN,\" he added.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told families of hostages held in Gaza that a deal to secure their release will be reached soon. It comes as Tel Aviv continues to attack the region.\n\nSpeaking to the families of the hostages in the US capital on Monday, Netanyahu said that \"the conditions (for an agreement) are undoubtedly there. This is a good sign.\"\n\nEfforts to reach a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas, outlined by Biden in May and brokered by Egypt and Qatar, have accelerated in the past month.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it will not happen all at once; there will be stages. However, I believe that we can move towards an agreement and allow ourselves to have leverage to free others (hostages who were not released in the first stage),\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe death toll from the Israeli attacks on Gaza on Tuesday (23/7/2023) reached 39,670 people. Among them, about 15,000 are children. Meanwhile, the number of injured was recorded at more than 90,147 people.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In the occupied West Bank there is widespread dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is being starved of tax revenue by Israel and struggling to pay its employees.\n\nThere are also rumours, Masri notes, that Mohammed Dahlan - an exiled Palestinian politician now advising the UAE president - may be parachuted back into Palestine at the behest of Arab powers sympathetic to Washington.\n\nFor Hamas, China-backed discussions give it a rare platform to participate in international forums.\n\n\"Hamas accepted the invitation to break the international isolation imposed by Washington and its allies, who accuse it of terrorism,\" Shawamreh said.\n\n\"China's invitation to Hamas opens the way for it to communicate internationally with Washington's competitors,\" she said, adding that Beijing ignored Israel's request to designate Hamas a terrorist organisation.\n\nThe Palestinian unity discussions are Beijing's latest effort at playing a role in mediation in the region: it hosted talks last year that led to the restoring of ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"China has long advocated for a new global order and global governance, aiming to reduce the influence of the US on the global stage,\" Sari Arho Havren, a specialist on Chinese foreign relations, told MEE.\n\n'China has ... positioned itself as a peacemaker and a viable alternative to the US' - Sari Arho Havren, analyst\n\n\"China has also sought a more prominent role in international politics and positioned itself as a peacemaker and a viable alternative to the US. This is evident in its actions in the Middle East, where it aligns with parties that oppose the US and its allies.\"\n\nAndrea Ghiselli, head researcher at TOChina Hub's ChinaMed Project, noted that China's growing influence in the region was not all due to Beijing's own actions.\n\n\"In this moment there is an unprecedented convergence between China's interests, goals, and narratives and those of most of the leaders in the Middle East,\" he told MEE.\n\n\"When it comes to Gaza, it is evident that supporting the Palestinians is a position that can hardly be described as uniquely Chinese since many people in the region and around the world, both Global South and Global North, share similar beliefs.\"\n\nChina was capitalising, Ghiselli said, with an eye to gaining a competitive advantage over Washington.\n\nTuesday's agreement was met with a forceful rejection by Israel, whose Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Abbas of embracing Hamas.\n\nKatz said that no such unity agreement would occur because \"Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar\".\n\nSo far, Gaza ceasefire negotiations have been dominated by the United States, with Hamas and Israel failing to come to an agreement as the Palestinian group seeks assurances any truce will remain permanant.\n\nHamas has complained that Washington presents itself as an honest broker in the talks, while heavily backing Israel's military and government in the war. It has asked China and Russia to be among the guarantors of any ceasefire deal.\n\nWhile Chinese-backed post-war plans offer an alternative for Palestinian groups tired of the West's approaches, which tend to favour Israel, it remains to be seen whether anything can really happen without the input of Israel's western allies.\n\n\"The US is the dominant [actor] in the conflict, and China's ability to influence it is limited,\" said Shawamreh.\n\n\"Israel is the de facto controlling power on the ground with the full support of the West. Washington is the only power capable of significantly influencing the war and its aftermath.\"\n\nAn observer of China's foreign relations based in Beijing, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect their position, told MEE that when it came to Iranian-Saudi negotiations, Beijing's input only came at the time of signing the agreement, to add weight to the decision.\n\n\"I think it would have been the same for this agreement, China does not have the means to unblock the negotiations,\" the source said.\n\nWhile China has long been a supporter of the Palestinian cause - former leader Mao Zedong once described Israel as a \"base of imperialism\" - in more recent months it has been accused of using vague language and being \"neutral\" since war broke out in Gaza in

It's positioning itself as a champion of Palestinian autonomy amid the Israel-Hamas war. China's diplomatic efforts are becoming a bigger way for it to challenge US power, an expert said.\n\nIn the nine-month war between Israel and Hamas, an unlikely nation has emerged as a key power broker in the Middle East: China.\n\nHamas and Fatah, the two most powerful Palestinian political groups, announced a truce on Monday brokered in Beijing, at the end of discussions between 14 Palestinian political factions, which culminated in the commitment to form an interim unity government once the war between Israel and Hamas is over, Reuters reported.\n\nChina's foreign minister Wang Yi hailed the agreement \"on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government\" as \"dedicated to the great reconciliation and unity of all 14 factions,\" state media reported.\n\nIt's an audacious move that places China at the center of negotiations in a conflict where the US has long been the main mediator.\n\nChina flexes new diplomatic power\n\nIn 2007, Hamas, an Islamist group classified as a terrorist group by the US, seized control of the Gaza Strip from Fatah.\n\nHamas is battling for for survival in the Gaza Strip, after its attack on Israel on October 7 prompted an Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip. Fatah has long been the biggest group in the PLO, which rules the West Bank.\n\nReconciling the groups with an eye to building a postwar Palestinian government is a diplomatic coup for Beijing, after years of trying to position itself as a power broker in the Middle East.\n\nThough Beijing is not part of the US diplomatic push to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, analysts say it is establishing itself as an important player in any postwar settlement.\n\n\"China seeks to burnish its credentials as a diplomatic intermediary. Previous efforts to unify Hamas and Fatah have failed, but Beijing hopes to demonstrate that, at least in principle, it can bridge intractable divides and de-escalate long-standing conflicts that Washington cannot,\" Ali Wyne, an analyst with the Crisis Group, told Business Insider.\n\nChina challenges US might in the Middle East\n\nIn the last few years, China has challenged US influence in the Middle East. In 2023, it helped broker a restoration of diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia after decades of proxy conflict. It also brokered closer ties with the Gulf states that have long been US allies.\n\nDeals like the Iran-Saudi rapprochement and the truce between Palestinian factions would likely have been impossible for the US, which has had adversarial relations with Iran and its regional proxies for decades.\n\n\"The United States can't be a credible mediator because it has played favorites in both the Iran-Saudi rivalry and in the competition between Israel and Iran,\" Middle East analyst Aaron David Miller wrote in Foreign Policy in 2023.\n\nWyne said that, while the world sees US-China rivalry through the prism of economics and military power, \"the diplomatic component will grow more salient as Beijing aims to become a more holistic great power.\"\n\nChina has not condemned the October 7 attacks and has championed Palestinian sovereignty, something Israel has refused to do.\n\nIt's part of China's wider strategy of positioning itself as the leader of developing nations, many of which are angered by Western support for Israel's campaign, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians, according to Hamas-run health authorities.\n\nBut though China is likely seeking political gains from the Israel-Hamas conflict, there are limits to how much Beijing is prepared to put on the line to influence the outcome, say some analysts.\n\nThe US has helped shoot down Iranian missiles heading to Israel in April. It also deployed two carrier strike groups to the region to deter attacks by Iran and its proxies in the weeks after October 7. China, meanwhile, has confined itself to diplomatic initiatives.\n\n\"China also doesn't want to sacrifice much to advance any of its interests in the Middle East,\" Jon Alterman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the US Congress in April.\n\n\"Where it invests, it does so deliberately,\" he added.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source":

The crossing, when open, is typically operated by Hamas personnel from Gaza's side, as the political and armed organization governs the interior of the Strip.\n\n\"Israel wants people who aren't affiliated with Hamas to do it, but objects to any official involvement of the Palestinian Authority - mostly for domestic political reasons,\" Axios added.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority rejected a proposal that would involve it in reopening the crossing in any unofficial capacity, the publication said.\n\nThe meeting reportedly included White House official Brett McGurk, the head of Israel's domestic spying agency Ronen Bar, secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee Hussein al-Sheikh and head of the PA's military intelligence Majed Faraj.\n\nThis was the first time that Palestinian officials have met with US and Israeli counterparts \"to discuss the day after the war ends in Gaza,\" reported Barak Ravid, the Axios writer who is frequently fed information by Israel's military and intelligence apparatus.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates also appears eager to conspire for a day-after plan in Gaza.\n\nThe Gulf state, which formalized relations with Israel in 2020, is looking \"to deploy a temporary international mission\" in Gaza that would establish \"law and order,\" the UAE ambassador at the United Nations, Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, wrote in the Financial Times last week.\n\n\"A temporary international presence in Gaza can only result from a formal invitation from the Palestinian Authority,\" the ambassador wrote.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority was created in the early 1990s following the Oslo accords to act as native auxiliary on behalf of the Israeli occupation. It has performed that role - one that PA leader Mahmoud Abbas calls \"sacred\" - without interruption since day one.\n\nIt wouldn't be surpring if Israel and its Arab allies sought to copy this model in a post-genocide Gaza Strip.\n\nBut in order for Israel to execute its vision in the wrecked coastal enclave, the Israeli military would have to achieve its stated goal of eliminating Hamas as a governing and military presence in Gaza.\n\nThis doesn't appear close to happening.\n\nMeanwhile, Fatah and Hamas agreed to \"end the Palestinian national division\" after the rival factions held negotiations in China this month alongside other Palestinian political parties.\n\nNotably, the factions \"underlined the Palestinian people's right to resist occupation and to end it in accordance with international law,\" according to Lebanese broadcaster Al Mayadeen, which obtained a copy of the declaration.\n\nThis is not the first time that the parties have made these declarations, and there is no indication that this one will be different.\n\nA Palestinian Authority official said over the weekend that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of Palestinians.\n\n\"Leaked news indicating that Washington is discussing plans on the future of the Gaza Strip with some parties will not have any legitimacy and will not be accepted by the Palestinian people,\" Nabil Abu Rudeineh is paraphrased to have said, according to Wafa News Agency.\n\nEchoing Israeli propaganda\n\nFollowing an Israeli massacre in al-Mawasi earlier this month that killed at least 90 Palestinians and injured hundreds of others, the Palestinian Authority issued a statement effectively blaming Hamas for Israel's slaughter.\n\n\"The presidency sees that by escaping national unity, and providing free pretexts to the occupation state, the Hamas movement is a partner in bearing legal, moral and political responsibility for the continuation of the Israeli war of genocide,\" PA leader Mahmoud Abbas wrote in a statement.\n\nAnother PA official actually used an Israeli propaganda talking point against Hamas.\n\n\"Hamas is actually hiding between the residents to protect and save itself,\" PA official Munir al-Jaghoub reportedly said.\n\n\"If Hamas wanted to fight face-to-face with Israel, it would've done so in areas where the army is located, and not in places where there are people.\"\n\nOmar said that the Palestinian Authority \"is trying to echo Israeli psychological warfare.\"\n\nIt is doing so \"by attempting to kind of de-link the Palestinian society overall from its resistance, and serving through this severance, serving Israeli war aims, which is to defeat the resistance and render Gaza unlivable.\"", "source": {"uri": "dissidentvoice.org",

people.\n\nAbu Ali also praised China's efforts to strengthen the Palestinian peoples' just and legitimate struggle for an independent, sovereign Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the relevant decisions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative.\n\nAt the invitation of the Chinese side, high-level representatives of 14 Palestinian factions held a reconciliation dialogue in Beijing from July 21 to 23, and inked a declaration on ending division and strengthening unity.\n\nIt is the first time that 14 Palestinian factions have gathered in Beijing for a reconciliation dialogue, bringing precious hope to the suffering Palestinian people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced that China has proposed a three-step approach to solving the Palestinian issue.\n\nNoting that the Palestinian issue is at the core of the Middle East issue, Wang said China harbors no self-interest concerning the Palestinian issue, and has always firmly supported the Palestinian people in restoring their legitimate national rights. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title":

Yi said the parties had agreed to establish an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to govern postwar Gaza. Abu Marzouk said, \"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it.\" In response, Israeli Foreign Minister Katz criticised Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah for moving towards reconciliation with Hamas. \"Instead of rejecting terrorism,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter), \"Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face.\" \"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\" Palestinian Islamic Jihad issued its own statement on the talks, saying it \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's [ie Fatah's] recognition of Israel.\" Meanwhile, two senior terrorists were among several Palestinian killed by an Israeli drone strike and in further clashes in the West Bank city of Tulkarem yesterday. The IDF named the two as Ashraf Nafeh, the head of Hamas in Tulkarem, and Muhammad Awad, the head of the Fatah-linked al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Tulkarem. The IDF said Nafeh was \"responsible for manufacturing and embedding explosives intended to attack IDF soldiers, as well as recruiting new operatives into the Hamas organisation. Additionally, he was involved in numerous attacks against IDF soldiers in Judea and Samaria, and was in contact with external Hamas terrorists who advanced terror attacks in Judea and Samaria.\" Awad, the IDF said, \"was actively involved in shooting attacks against IDF soldiers. In addition, he raised terror funds to support the battalion's activity in the area, and procured weaponry for the battalion.\" Israeli military sources also said a female Palestinian combatant was killed after brandishing a weapon whilst wearing clothing marked \"medical service\". Also yesterday, two Israeli Defence Ministry employees were lightly wounded when a bomb exploded at the security barrier in the Mount Gilboa area. The Shin Bet also announced on Monday that it had foiled a plot by a West Bank terror cell to kidnap Israelis. This followed the intelligence service revealing on Sunday that it had also thwarted a plan by Palestinian university students to launch a shooting attack on Israelis in the West Bank. In Gaza, the IDF has continued its operations in Khan Younis. Ahead of the operation, the IDF called on Gazan civilians to temporarily evacuate from specific areas of Khan Younis. According to the IDF, this was based on \"intelligence indicating that terrorists were operating and firing rockets in these areas, as well as efforts by Hamas to reassemble its forces there.\" IDF activity includes operations above and below ground, with the IDF confirming they have \"eliminated several terrorists\".\n\nContext: Hamas and Fatah have been divided, and the Palestinian national movement split, since elections in 2006 and a bloody civil war in 2007 left Hamas in power in Gaza and the Fatah Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority (PA) in control in parts of the West Bank.\n\nAlthough notable, this provisional accord, if confirmed, should not yet be considered final. Seeming unification accords between Hamas and Fatah have ultimately come to nought in recent years. Ongoing tensions between the two parties was illustrated again recently when Abbas responded to the Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Mohammed Deif by blaming Hamas for the sufferings of the Gazan people during the war. Fatah officials highlight that Hamas are coming to the talks at its weakest point due to the losses it has taken in Gaza. Israeli media cites Fatah officials playing down reports of an agreement, saying that the joint statement was mainly intended as a show of respect to their Chinese hosts. The US has long pushed for the PA to assume a leading role in the post-war governance of the Strip. Even before these moves towards reconciliation, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been publicly resistant to such moves, citing the PA's ongoing incitement of terror and financial support of terrorists, known as 'pay for slay'. Katz's comment that \"Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar\" is a reaffirmation of this position, and a reflection of sections of the Israel right's desire for Israel to retain control of the Strip post-Hamas. The US has also been clear that Hamas cannot be part of the future governance of Gaza, and with US financial and diplomatic support essential for the reconstruction of the devastated Strip, any governance structure including Hamas would likely have serious implications for US support. China's brokering and hosting of reconciliation talks reflects Beijing's increasing diplomatic assertiveness and desire to insert itself as a major player in the region. It follows, for example, its 2023 brokering of peace talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The IDF said that its Tulkarem operation was one of 50 it has carried out in the West Bank over the past nine months. Some 4,400 Palestinian have been arrested, including some 1,850 affiliated with Hamas. The Palestinian Health Authority lists more than 560 Palestinians killed in the West Bank in that time, with Israel saying the majority were combatants killed during raids. 27 Israelis have been killed in that time, either from terror attacks or during clashes in the West Bank. Since October 7th, many have warned that the PA's increasing lack of control in the West Bank could lead to a major conflagration. Thus far, despite the IDF's need to conduct regular counter-terror raids, this has not come to pass. The PA, along with Washington, have repeatedly complained that Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich's withholding of tax revenues collected on its behalf by Israel has exacerbated its own security services lack of control. The period has also seen a surge in violence from Israeli settlers towards West Bank Palestinians.\n\nLooking ahead: Israel has reportedly reached agreement with the UAE and the World Health Organisation to facilitate the evacuation of 250 sick and wounded Gazans for medical treatment in the Emirates next week.\n\nThe Israeli hostage negotiation delegation is expected to leave tonight for Egypt for further talks, with its latest proposal likely to be floated tomorrow.

One example was the Chinese-mediated deal last year restoring ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The US also urged China to discourage both Iran from financing proxies attacking Israel and the Houthis from targeting commercial shipping. \"We have asked China to use its influence to try to bring those attacks to an end, and we'll continue to do that,\" Miller said.\n\nTuvia Gering, a China and Middle East analyst at the Institute for National Security Studies, said the move is part of China's effort to rival the US by building alliances with developing nations as well as the Arab and Muslim world to prioritize its interests and stifle Western dominance.\n\nChina is \"challenging America in every space possible as a new type of major power that takes in the considerations of the Global South and the coalitions of those oppressed by imperialism and Western hegemony\" to create \"a new global order,\" he told The Algemeiner.\n\nGering condemned Beijing's move, saying it \"normalized terrorism\" and will embolden the Palestinians into further intransigence in talks for any future peace accord.\n\n\"Until today, China failed to criticize [the Palestinians] and put all the onus onto Israel. This means effectively that the Palestinians will only adhere to the most maximalist positions in negotiations for the two state solution [which] will become even more of a distant reality,\" Gering told The Algemeiner.\n\nGering also predicted that the \"golden age\" of China-Israel relations, which burgeoned over the last decade with the inking of major bilateral deals, was over because of China's decision to \"legitimize terror\" since Oct. 7. Gering warned that moving forward, Israeli strategy in the region must also take China into account.\n\nGering expressed doubts that the declaration signed on Tuesday would lead to any major developments, noting \"a large amount of skepticism\" in the Arab world.\n\nIndeed, the declaration gave no outline for how or when a new unity Palestinian government would be formed.\n\nThe Gaza-based Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group, which was also a signatory on the declaration, issued a statement later in the day outlining its demand for all factions in any future unity government to reject recognition of Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz blasted the agreement, saying it underscored Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' embrace of \"the murderers and rapists\" of Hamas, which rules Gaza.\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Katz said.\n\nIn his statement, Wang reiterated China's commitment to a \"comprehensive, lasting, and sustainable ceasefire\" in Gaza and advocated for an \"international peace conference\" aimed at pursuing a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nDina Lisnyansky, an expert in Middle East affairs and Islam, warned that while the deal may not come to fruition, China's role is of growing concern for Israel. Egypt and Algeria -- both mediators in failed past attempts at rapprochement between Fatah and Hamas -- were far weaker than China as regional actors. \"When China sets its sights on something it usually achieves its goals, so it should worry us greatly,\" Lisnyansky told The Algemeiner.\n\nLisnyansky also said that Israel should sanction the PA for signing the declaration. \"Israel should negate any entity that has any ties at all to Hamas, which needs to lose both its authority and legitimacy.\"", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"},

The two enemy parties, which have been meeting with the main Palestinian factions - 14 groups in all - in the Chinese capital since last Sunday, signed in the presence of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, a joint \"declaration on ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\"\n\nAs the conflict in Gaza has entered its tenth month, the declaration calls, according to the Chinese side, for the creation of an \"interim national reconciliation government around the post-war reconstruction of Gaza.\" No timetable or details were given. \". The key to the Palestinian reconciliation process is to bolster confidence, keep to the right direction, and make incremental progress,\" Wang said.\n\nChina has thereby moved to reinforce its diplomatic stature, casting itself as a mediator of reconciliations. It had already brokered in March 2023 a deal normalizing relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia - although this was low-hanging fruit for Beijing. This time, however, differences have continued to linger over the substance. Two delegations from Hamas and Fatah had already visited the Chinese capital in April for several days of discussions, but the absence of a joint communiqu\u00e9 at the end of the talks meant that little concrete progress had been made.\n\nThe People's Republic of China has been a long-standing supporter of Palestine, even though it has strengthened its ties with Israel in recent years. Yet for a long time, it had thought that interfering in attempts to resolve the conflict would only produce blowback, so it kept its distance. Having gained in confidence and now positioned itself as offering a counter-approach to that of the US, it has lately sought to achieve successful outcomes for which it could then claim credit.\n\nIn particular, welcoming Hamas, which carried out the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, has involved a highly different approach from that of the Americans or Europeans. \"The ongoing conflict in Gaza shows that ignoring Hamas and separating the Palestinians is a failure that only produces the opposite of the desired result,\" said Tang Zhichao, a Middle East specialist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, by way of argument.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington, where he was due to meet President Joe Biden. The same week, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba paid a visit to Beijing that served as a reminder of the vital role of Chinese diplomacy in any attempt to resolve the other significant ongoing conflict.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmytro Kuleba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Social_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Academy of Social Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Ukraine)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/23/602/0/7226/3613/1440/720/60/0/4c246af_1721742996611-632002.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 19}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The international community should further unite on the issue of ceasefire.\n\nThe second step is to uphold the principle of \"the Palestinians governing Palestine\" and work together to promote post-war governance in Gaza. Gaza is an inseparable and important part of Palestine, and starting post-war reconstruction as soon as possible has become an urgent issue in the next stage.\n\nThe international community should support Palestinian factions to form an interim government with national consensus to effectively manage Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe third step is to promote Palestine to become a full member of the United Nations and begin to implement the two-state solution. A more significant, more authoritative and more effective international peace conference should be supported, and a timetable and road map for this should be made.\n\nWang said ceasefire and humanitarian relief are top priorities, \"the Palestinians governing Palestine\" is the basic principle of post-war reconstruction in Gaza, and the two-state solution is the fundamental way out for the future.\n\n\"The international community should support the parties concerned in implementing the three-step approach with a serious attitude,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "wafa.ps", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFA Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.\n\nAt China's mediation, representatives from Hamas, Fatah and other Palestinian factions signed a joint statement in Beijing, agreeing to end years-long divisions and form a national unity government.\n\nThe statement, or the Beijing Declaration, has been largely welcomed. Upon its signing, Palestine parties and the international community acknowledged the significance of the Beijing Declaration in ending bloodshed and promoting the peace process in the Middle East, and spoke highly of China's role as a global mediator.\n\nHamas spokesperson Hossam Badran said on Telegram that the Declaration was an \"additional positive step on the path to achieving Palestinian national unity,\" stressing that \"the most important\" part of what was agreed was to form a Palestinian national consensus government.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative (PNI), one of the 14 factions signing the agreement, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that the agreement goes \"much further\" than any other reached in recent years. Barghouti believes the move towards a unity government is especially important as it \"blocks Israeli efforts to create some sort of collaborative structure against Palestinian interests.\"\n\n\"This (Beijing Declaration) is an important step towards furthering Palestine unity,\" Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres commented, adding that Palestine unity is \"crucial for peace and security and for advancing the aspirations of the Palestinian people for self-determination and for a fully independent, democratic, contiguous, viable, and sovereign Palestinian state.\"\n\nFrom the d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia, to the reconciliation wave in the Middle East, and to the Beijing Declaration clinched on Tuesday, China has demonstrated its capability of being a global mediator and its determination for global peace and stability; and this is recognized by the international community.\n\n\"We highly appreciate the Chinese position and Chinese support. Without Chinese help, it would have been very difficult for us to reach this agreement ... We highly appreciate the role of China and we thank China for its role,\" Barghouti told CGTN on Tuesday.\n\nOn behalf of the UN Secretary-General, Dujarric also expressed appreciation toward the efforts made by the People's Republic of China, as well as efforts of other countries involved in facilitating the process.\n\nJeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, spoke highly of China's role as a global mediator. \"China has pulled two rabbits out of the hat in the Middle East,\" with one being the reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran - which the U.S. \"could never have imagined or done\" - and the Beijing Declaration being the other one, Sachs said in an interview with CGTN.\n\nThe reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas in forming a unity front is \"extremely positive and important,\" showing that China \"is increasingly able to broker peace, and to find solutions to problems that America calls impossible or irreconcilable,\" Sachs said.", "source": {"uri": "news.cgtn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.cgtn.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "first_voice@news.cgtn.com", "name": "First Voice", "type":

Now an official unity deal was signed during talks in Beijing brokered by the Chinese Communist regime in which Hamas commits to be represented by the PLO. This moves things forward to the next stage in which Hamas claims to take a back seat while the Palestinian Authority is out front in its traditional role of collecting foreign aid while Hamas gets veto power.\n\nWestern donors get a \"technocratic\" government of front men for Fatah and the PLO terrorists who in turn serve as front men for Hamas which may even temporarily go back to its old role of playing front men to Islamic Jihad. The Palestinian Authority is now officially a Hamas front with little plausible deniability left.\n\nEuropean countries lining up to recognize a 'Palestinian state', soon to be followed by the Biden or Harris administration if they get the chance, are really recognizing a front for Hamas. And the intended reward for Oct 7, as for all previous acts of Islamic terrorism against Israel, is international diplomatic recognition.\n\nBut the plausible deniability is thinner than ever. It is now abundantly clear what a 'Palestinian State' is and what it's meant to accomplish. The wall between the 'moderate' Palestinian Authority and the 'extremist' Hamas is fully down.

Photo: Xinhua\n\n(Global Times) On Tuesday, Beijing became the focal point of global diplomacy. Representatives of 14 Palestinian factions signed the Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity, historically announcing the end of division and the strengthening of Palestinian unity. On the same day, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba began his visit to China, marking the first visit by a Ukrainian foreign minister since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Parties from two of the world's most significant conflict regions simultaneously seek political solutions in China, forming a \"diplomatic resonance.\" One netizen commented, \"The world is in tatters, and China is stitching it back together.\" While these words may not be entirely accurate, they vividly reflect China's efforts to fulfill the Global Security Initiative and address the deficit in global peace.\n\nThe Israel-Palestine conflict and internal Palestinian divisions involve extremely complex backgrounds and interests, making the reconciliation process long and tortuous. The gathering of 14 Palestinian factions in Beijing for reconciliation talks has been met with cautious optimism by mainstream international media. The announcement of the Beijing Declaration immediately shocked international public opinion. Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, stated that the Beijing Declaration goes \"much further\" than any other reached in recent years. The scene of representatives from 14 factions signing the declaration marks an important historical moment in the Palestinian liberation movement and brings valuable hope to the long-suffering Palestinian people.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration is a crucial step toward resolving the Palestinian issue and achieving peace and stability in the Middle East. It is also the first time that an internal Palestinian reconciliation document has been organized by a country outside the Arab world. When asked why this conflict can only be resolved in Beijing rather than elsewhere in the world, Mustafa Barghouti said it is because China is \"very decent and honest.\" The sincere efforts made by China to support the rights of the Palestinian people, end division and unify the Palestinian stance have been highly praised by all factions in the Beijing Declaration, which is well-deserved.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration also holds transcendent significance. From achieving historical reconciliation last year between Iran and Saudi Arabia to today's Beijing Declaration, the world has witnessed a broader range of possibilities and gained immense confidence. The new security path advocated by China - dialogue rather than confrontation, partnership instead of alliance, and win-win cooperation instead of zero-sum games - has proven to be viable. A world characterized by lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity, openness, inclusiveness, and ecological beauty is attainable. Unraveling knots does not require the sword. Beyond isolation, pressure, sanctions, confrontation, interference, aggression, and mutual destruction, humanity has another path: resolving complex and difficult issues through dialogue and cooperation. Humanity does not have to repeat the mistakes of the past and is not bound to the historical cycles of war and peace, prosperity and decline, order and chaos. The Global Security Initiative advocated by China is a beacon of hope.\n\nThe progress in Palestinian internal reconciliation also provides insights into the ultimate resolution of another conflict. Besides discussing China-Ukraine bilateral relations, a key focus of Kuleba's visit to China is seeking ways to end the Ukrainian crisis in discussions with China. Before his trip, Kuleba recorded a video for Chinese netizens, expressing his hope for \"real and just peace\" and for Ukraine to \"restore stable development and prosperity, and security for the people.\" Promoting a peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian crisis is a consistent stance of China, which has also made significant efforts toward this goal. The door to peace remains open, and for the international community, it is crucial to work toward encouraging peace talks rather than the opposite.\n\nPeace cannot be achieved overnight, and China is aware of the difficulties along the way. However, as long as it benefits the world and its people, China feels an unshirkable responsibility. Currently, the parties involved in the world's two major regional conflicts are in China, both seeking goals related to \"peace.\" This is not coincidental. China's impartial stance, free from selfish motives or interests, has garnered increasing trust from the international community. As a value system and methodology that China offers for global peace, the Global Security Initiative transcends geopolitical and ideological differences, and is the greatest common denominator for all parties seeking peace and reconciliation. Each successful practice of the GSI attracts more like-minded partners and continually validates the ancient Chinese saying: \"Virtue is not left to stand alone, and he who practices it will have neighbors.\"", "source": {"uri": "bbs.chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbs.chinadaily.com.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Declaration",

China's methodical approach has been essential to advancing a more comprehensive peace process, as it still has economic relations with Israel. This kind of diplomatic adaptability and dedication are the reasons why China has been able to effectively work with both Palestinian and Israeli leaders.\n\nPotential impact\n\nA united Palestinian front might result in a more stable government within the Palestinian territories, lowering internal tensions and creating a constructive environment that is better suited for socioeconomic development and post-war reconstruction plans in Gaza. History tells us that internal disputes only result in violence and economic stagnation in a devastating fashion.\n\nIt is only through a single, cohesive representation in talks with Israel and other international parties that the Palestinians could achieve better results in conflict resolution. In the absence of a Palestinian unity government, there can be no consistent and logical policy positions to improve the effectiveness of diplomatic engagements.\n\nThe Beijing-brokered deal serves as a successful example for other influential peace partners to follow. It can and should inspire other brokers to become more involved in supporting the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government. Just like the Chinese government, they should also back the Palestinian cause by providing emergency humanitarian aid. In the words of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the \"tremendous sufferings\" in Gaza \"should not continue indefinitely\" and \"justice should not be absent forever.\"\n\nGeopolitical setbacks\n\nThe truth is usually hard and uncomfortable. A major obstacle to the unity declaration may be the absence of tangible enforcement measures to guarantee adherence by the participating parties. There is a chance that some Palestinian factions might not follow through on their commitments if there aren't any explicit accountability procedures or incentives in place.\n\nIt feels bitter indeed to say that the international community has in the past made unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. The historical background of these geopolitical setbacks may raise questions about the Beijing Declaration's long-term viability too. Due to bitter rivalry over power, a future unity government may encounter opposition from extremist groups with strong influence. This internal resistance could easily spark new conflicts from Gaza to the West Bank and to the Israeli-Lebanese borderlands.\n\nAnd there is a deeper issue. Some regional and international players with conflicting interests and goals may exercise power to undermine China's efforts to achieve a lasting ceasefire. The argument is that just like the Chinese government, the international community is also expected to invest heavily in political will to help implement the unity declaration. Unlike the past, such coordination shouldn't be absent from the new deal.\n\nTo make some sense of it, a good deal has happened and an Israeli-Palestinian settlement along its lines may also be within reach. The Beijing Declaration serves as a positive example of China's growing diplomatic influence and capacity to help conjure up a years-long settlement outside of its own borders. It is a demonstration of China's dedication to Middle Eastern peace and stability, enhancing its political status as an assertive and responsible global force.", "source": {"uri": "news.cgtn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.cgtn.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bobby_naderi@news.cgtn.com", "name": "Bobby Naderi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://news.cgtn.com/news/2024-07-24/The-Beijing-Declaration-A-new-chapter-in-Palestinian-unity-1vuJGw8zzq0/img/807d23d90be5445982eda95c0e4ef5a2/807d23d90be5445982eda95c0e4ef5a2-750.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-04-", "textStart": 110, "textEnd": 118}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

For Beijing, the pact has 'more propaganda value than geostrategic substance,' the staffer adds.\n\nWith Washington foreign policy in flux, Communist China is attempting to muscle in on regions where America was once dominant, including the Mideast. On Monday it orchestrated a new pact legitimizing the Hamas terrorists.\n\nPalestinian factions traveled to Beijing for three days of talks that were concluded Monday when they signed a document of intent to create a \"unity government\" and conduct a future election. Among the included 14 factions are the America-backed Fatah party that dominates the Palestinian Authority and its rival, Hamas.\n\n\"The U.S. is retreating from the Middle East, so it gives the Chinese an opportunity to get into the region,\" a congressional staffer tells the Sun. For Beijing, the pact has \"more propaganda value than geostrategic substance,\" the staffer adds.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions but at the same time it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Beijing's foreign minister, Wang Yi, said Monday. \"When some other countries add oil to the fire, we try our best to bring peace,\" a foreign ministry spokesman, Bi Haibo, added.\n\nThere seems to be much less than meets the eye in the Beijing pact. \"Many similar agreements were signed between Fatah and Hamas since 2011, and not one line in them was implemented,\" a veteran Arab world watcher in Israel, Ehud Ya'ari, told Channel 12 television. In the three days of negotiations, he added, talks ended in screams and door-slamming \"but no one wanted to insult the Chinese,\" so the factions signed a meaningless piece of paper.\n\nRather than achieving the ever-elusive unity among rival Palestinian factions, the Monday signing seems mostly about Communist China's global competition with America, including in the Mideast.\n\nLast year Beijing chaperoned the renewal of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran. As in the Palestinian case, the pact is yet to end the enmity between the two regional rivals, and was mostly designed to raise Chairman Xi's diplomatic profile.\n\nThe Chinese Communists have always argued that unity among Palestinian factions is a crucial step for statehood. Now they're \"going to blow this agreement out of proportion,\" a China watcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, Tuvia Gering, tells the Sun.\n\nIn state-owned media, he adds, Beijing is displaying split-screen graphics, with \"America-supported Israeli war scenes on one side, and pro-peace China, with images of today's agreement, on the other.\" They also \"claim success where many before them have failed, which raises their image as a top world player.\"\n\nCommunist China is appealing to the so-called Global South, presenting itself as an alternative to America. It is \"hoping to gain support in the Arab and Muslim world,\" Mr. Gering says. While America is accusing China of committing genocide against Uyghur Muslims at Xinjiang province, he adds, Beijing is now \"accusing America of committing genocide, through Israel, of Muslims in Gaza.\"\n\nIf and when Communist China invades Taiwan, Mr. Xi expects full support from Arab and Muslim countries in return for Beijing's support for Gaza, Mr. Gering says: \"It's like, '\u200fI support your core interests, so you must support mine.'\"\n\nAmerica meanwhile is struggling to cut a deal to end the Gaza war and release hostages. In an upcoming meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Harris, is expected to try her hand in handling complex Mideast diplomacy.\n\nMs. Harris will tell the Israeli premier that \"it is time for the war to end in a way that Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinians enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self determination,\" an unidentified aide to the vice president told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBeyond such generalities, President Biden is hoping to end his term with a Gaza breakthrough. His Mideast adviser, Brent McGurk, has met secretly at Abu Dhabi recently with a top Netanyahu aide, Ron Dermer, and the United Arab Emirates's foreign minister, Abdullah Bin Zayed, Axios reports.\n\nThe three discussed plans for post-war Gaza, including an idea for a multi-national force. The UAE's ambassador at the United Nations, Lana Nusseibeh, said that Emirati troops could join such a force. In a Financial Times op-ed, Ms. Nusseibeh wrote that one condition for dispatching the force is that it would officially be invited by the Palestinian Authority.\n\nAmerica is the Palestinian Authority's top financial supporter. It also lists Hamas as a terrorist organization. Following the October 7 massacre, Mr. Biden said the group must be \"eliminated.\" Although the Beijing-sponsored Hamas-Fatah pact is unlikely to be implemented, the mere fact of it being signed could pose problems for Washington's efforts to end the Gaza war.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benny_avni@nysun.com", "name":

Analysts are sceptical - one described the Beijing meeting from 21-23 July as a \"celebratory event\", telling Reuters it was \"impossible to resolve\" the differences between the Palestinian factions in three days. Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 after defeating Fatah in a civil war, and previous agreements have fallen apart. Beijing's proposals for a two-state solution and free elections are ironic given its contempt for democracy at home. They're also ambitious, underlining its bid to become a leading mediator abroad. China is expanding its influence through the Brics alliance, which now includes Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.

China's methodical approach has been essential to advancing a more comprehensive peace process, as it still has economic relations with Israel. This kind of diplomatic adaptability and dedication are the reasons why China has been able to effectively work with both Palestinian and Israeli leaders.\n\nPotential impact\n\nA united Palestinian front might result in a more stable government within the Palestinian territories, lowering internal tensions and creating a constructive environment that is better suited for socioeconomic development and post-war reconstruction plans in Gaza. History tells us that internal disputes only result in violence and economic stagnation in a devastating fashion.\n\nIt is only through a single, cohesive representation in talks with Israel and other international parties that the Palestinians could achieve better results in conflict resolution. In the absence of a Palestinian unity government, there can be no consistent and logical policy positions to improve the effectiveness of diplomatic engagements.\n\nThe Beijing-brokered deal serves as a successful example for other influential peace partners to follow. It can and should inspire other brokers to become more involved in supporting the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government. Just like the Chinese government, they should also back the Palestinian cause by providing emergency humanitarian aid. In the words of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the \"tremendous sufferings\" in Gaza \"should not continue indefinitely\" and \"justice should not be absent forever.\"\n\nGeopolitical setbacks\n\nThe truth is usually hard and uncomfortable. A major obstacle to the unity declaration may be the absence of tangible enforcement measures to guarantee adherence by the participating parties. There is a chance that some Palestinian factions might not follow through on their commitments if there aren't any explicit accountability procedures or incentives in place.\n\nIt feels bitter indeed to say that the international community has in the past made unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. The historical background of these geopolitical setbacks may raise questions about the Beijing Declaration's long-term viability too. Due to bitter rivalry over power, a future unity government may encounter opposition from extremist groups with strong influence. This internal resistance could easily spark new conflicts from Gaza to the West Bank and to the Israeli-Lebanese borderlands.\n\nAnd there is a deeper issue. Some regional and international players with conflicting interests and goals may exercise power to undermine China's efforts to achieve a lasting ceasefire. The argument is that just like the Chinese government, the international community is also expected to invest heavily in political will to help implement the unity declaration. Unlike the past, such coordination shouldn't be absent from the new deal.\n\nTo make some sense of it, a good deal has happened and an Israeli-Palestinian settlement along its lines may also be within reach. The Beijing Declaration serves as a positive example of China's growing diplomatic influence and capacity to help conjure up a years-long settlement outside of its own borders. It is a demonstration of China's dedication to Middle Eastern peace and stability, enhancing its political status as an assertive and responsible global force.\n\n(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com.

Since the current war broke out in Gaza, Hamas officials have said the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/jul/Mahmoud-al-Aloul_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The White House dismisses Israel's protests that the PA supports terrorism and is too feeble to resist Hamas as domestic political pandering. The only way to defeat Hamas in Gaza, says the U.S., is to hand the keys to Mahmoud Abbas and a \"revitalized\" PA.\n\nGood thing Israel didn't take Secretary of State Antony Blinken's word for it. On Tuesday the PA's many factions signed an agreement with Hamas and Islamic Jihad to form a unity Palestinian government. Oh, and they did it in Beijing, with China's foreign minister presiding over warm handshakes with the perpetrators of the Oct. 7 massacre.\n\nThe plan is to form an interim reconciliation government for Gaza and the West Bank, where the PA has been losing ground to Hamas. But the agreement lacks a timetable for implementation and faces many obstacles. Hamas slaughtered Mr. Abbas's party comrades in Gaza in 2007, and experiments in unity since then have been abortive. At this stage the agreement is notable primarily for what it says about the parties involved.\n\nThe deal is a way for the PA to signal solidarity with the \"resistance.\" Though the Biden Administration ignores the broad popularity of Oct. 7 among Palestinians, Mr. Abbas can afford no such illusions. Hamas's atrocities are glorified and its decision to launch the war earns about 70% support in Palestinian polls.\n\nThe PA is a husk. The foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates reportedly called it \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" at an April meeting with Mr. Blinken. But this month the U.A.E. said it could join a stabilization force for postwar Gaza if the PA invites it.\n\nHamas also seeks to use the PA as political cover, and it expects President Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris to fall for it. The terrorists would love to copy the Hezbollah model from Lebanon and become the power behind the throne in Gaza, devoted to war alone. Aid groups can be trusted not to object as Hamas rebuilds behind Western-funded PA signage.\n\nThis Beijing Declaration is also a way for Hamas to advertise its diplomatic success. Carrying out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust has improved its standing in Beijing, Moscow and Pretoria, without jeopardizing support from Tehran, Doha and Ankara. Hamas has become a player on the world stage.\n\nChina enjoys coordinating anti-American forces and disrupting U.S. diplomacy. Since Hamas has proved effective at sparking wars that stress the U.S. regional alliance system, China will help keep Hamas in business.\n\nWhile liberals insist on a Palestinian state, they rarely ask what kind of state it would be. At present it would be a Hamas state, by force of the ballot or the bullet. Creating a jihadist-theocracy Iranian satellite state isn't high on a list of vital U.S. priorities.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [],

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nChina's foreign minister Wang Yi hailed the agreement \"on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government\" as \"dedicated to the great reconciliation and unity of all 14 factions,\" state media reported.\n\nIt's an audacious move that places China at the center of negotiations in a conflict where the US has long been the main mediator.\n\nIn 2007, Hamas, an Islamist group classified as a terrorist group by the US, seized control of the Gaza Strip from Fatah.\n\nHamas is battling for for survival in the Gaza Strip, after its attack on Israel on October 7 prompted an Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip. Fatah has long been the biggest group in the PLO, which rules the West Bank.\n\nReconciling the groups with an eye to building a postwar Palestinian government is a diplomatic coup for Beijing, after years of trying to position itself as a power broker in the Middle East.\n\nThough Beijing is not part of the US diplomatic push to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, analysts say it is establishing itself as an important player in any postwar settlement.\n\n\"China seeks to burnish its credentials as a diplomatic intermediary. Previous efforts to unify Hamas and Fatah have failed, but Beijing hopes to demonstrate that, at least in principle, it can bridge intractable divides and de-escalate long-standing conflicts that Washington cannot,\" Ali Wyne, an analyst with the Crisis Group, told Business Insider.\n\nIn the last few years, China has challenged US influence in the Middle East. In 2023, it helped broker a restoration of diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia after decades of proxy conflict. It also brokered closer ties with the Gulf states that have long been US allies.\n\nDeals like the Iran-Saudi rapprochement and the truce between Palestinian factions would likely have been impossible for the US, which has had adversarial relations with Iran and its regional proxies for decades.\n\n\"The United States can't be a credible mediator because it has played favorites in both the Iran-Saudi rivalry and in the competition between Israel and Iran,\" Middle East analyst Aaron David Miller wrote in Foreign Policy in 2023.\n\nWyne said that, while the world sees US-China rivalry through the prism of economics and military power, \"the diplomatic component will grow more salient as Beijing aims to become a more holistic great power.\"\n\nChina has not condemned the October 7 attacks and has championed Palestinian sovereignty, something Israel has refused to do.\n\nIt's part of China's wider strategy of positioning itself as the leader of developing nations, many of which are angered by Western support for Israel's campaign, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians, according to Hamas-run health authorities.\n\nBut though China is likely seeking political gains from the Israel-Hamas conflict, there are limits to how much Beijing is prepared to put on the line to influence the outcome, say some analysts.\n\nThe US has helped shoot down Iranian missiles heading to Israel in April. It also deployed two carrier strike groups to the region to deter attacks by Iran and its proxies in the weeks after October 7. China, meanwhile, has confined itself to diplomatic initiatives.\n\n\"China also doesn't want to sacrifice much to advance any of its interests in the Middle East,\" Jon Alterman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the US Congress in April.\n\n\"Where it invests, it does so deliberately,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType":

The briefing, led by Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller, delved into the complex dynamics of the ongoing conflict and the quest for peace.\n\nThe session opened with a query about the recent agreement between Hamas and Fatah to end their divisions and form an interim national unity government, brokered during negotiations in China. This agreement, known as the Beijing Declaration, had yet to be fully reviewed by the United States. Miller reiterated that the U.S. considers Hamas a terrorist organization, a stance established long before the escalation of the conflict on October 7th. He emphasized that there could be no role for a terrorist organization like Hamas in the governance of Gaza post-conflict.\n\nThe discussion soon turned to the role of China in facilitating these talks and its influence in Middle Eastern diplomacy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had engaged with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi multiple times, urging China to use its regional influence constructively. Miller highlighted that China's relationships with countries like Iran, which supports proxies attacking Israel, could potentially help de-escalate tensions.\n\nAs the briefing continued, attention shifted to reactions from Israeli officials. Israel's foreign minister had criticized Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for allegedly embracing elements of Hamas, further complicating the peace process. Miller dismissed the notion that this declaration should impact ongoing ceasefire discussions, emphasizing the progress already made and the U.S. commitment to achieving an agreement.\n\nA significant portion of the briefing focused on whether Hamas could ever be integrated into a peaceful political framework. Miller stressed that Hamas had not renounced terrorism or violence, nor had it accepted the principles of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), including a commitment to a two-state solution. He maintained that as long as Hamas adhered to its current stance, it could not be seen as a legitimate governing entity for the Palestinian people.\n\nThe briefing also touched on the humanitarian impact of the conflict. Reports of numerous Palestinian journalists being killed raised concerns about press freedom and the safety of those reporting from Gaza. Miller acknowledged the sacrifices of journalists and reiterated the U.S. administration's efforts to secure a ceasefire to alleviate civilian suffering.\n\nIn summary, the press briefing highlighted the intricate challenges facing Middle East diplomacy. The U.S. remains firm in its stance against Hamas, seeking a political path forward that excludes terrorist organizations while advocating for a unified Palestinian governance under the Palestinian Authority. The role of international players like China and regional dynamics continues to shape the complex landscape of Middle East peace efforts.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news",

Historically, attempts to reconcile these factions have failed, with deep-seated ideological divides and a history of violent conflict. However, China's involvement brings a new dynamic to the mediation process, which could either pave the way for significant progress or fall into the pattern of past failures.\n\nThe primary advantage of this unity deal lies in the potential for greater political stability within the Palestinian territories. A unified government could facilitate more effective governance, streamline international aid distribution, and improve living conditions for Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Additionally, China's role as a mediator introduces a fresh perspective, which could break the longstanding deadlock in reconciliation efforts.\n\nHowever, skepticism abounds regarding the durability and sincerity of this agreement. Past reconciliation attempts have consistently fallen short, raising questions about whether this latest effort will yield different results. Furthermore, Hamas's designation as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, and other countries complicates international relations and casts doubt on the legitimacy of any government that includes Hamas without a clear renunciation of violence and recognition of Israel.\n\nThere are significant concerns about the true motives behind China's mediation. Critics argue that Beijing's involvement is driven more by a desire to expand its geopolitical influence rather than a genuine commitment to resolving the Palestinian conflict. This skepticism is further fueled by China's broader strategy to present itself as a key player in Middle Eastern affairs, positioning itself as an alternative to traditional Western mediators.\n\nThe response from the international community has been cautious. The United States has reiterated its position that any Palestinian government must renounce violence, recognize Israel, and adhere to previous agreements. This stance reflects deep reservations about the inclusion of Hamas in the unity deal.\n\nAs US State Department Matthew Miller said this week, \"Hamas has not renounced terrorism; it has not renounced the use of violence to achieve its political aims; it has not renounced the destruction of the state of Israel - something the PLO has done. It remains a terrorist organization. It remains committed to killing civilians. It remains committed to bringing about the destruction of the state of Israel. So no, we do not see an organization that believes in those tactics and believes in carrying out terrorism as a suitable organization to govern the Palestinian people.\"\n\nSimilarly, the European Union has expressed concerns about Hamas's role but has shown some openness to dialogue, emphasizing the importance of Palestinian unity for peace negotiations and stressing the need for any unified government to commit to democratic principles and peaceful resolutions.\n\nWhile the Fatah-Hamas unity deal brokered by China holds the promise of political stability and improved governance, it is fraught with challenges and skepticism. The historical context of failed reconciliation attempts, ideological divides, and international concerns about Hamas's involvement pose significant obstacles.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the international community will closely monitor the implementation and impact of this agreement, weighing its potential benefits against the longstanding complexities of the Palestinian conflict.", "source": {"uri": "opednews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpEdNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_lansvin@opednews.com", "name": "Mark Lansvin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International recognition of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.opednews.com/populum/visuals/2024/07/2024-07-523662-13736723885_f1d00975c5_o-306.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

This is historic. It will end division and strengthening Palestinian unity among the 14 factions that has been long ignored by US, who at the same time came up with various accords for Middle East peace.\n\nThe PLO is a coalition of parties that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993 (Oslo Accord) and formed a new government in the Palestinian Authority (PA) and dominated by Fatah. Hamas was not party to the accords and does not recognise Israel. The PA governs parts of the West Bank and Hamas, Gaza.\n\nWestern media have questioned the extent of Beijing's geopolitical clout as a peace broker where US is 'dominant' for so long. Need we say more? It was China who played a role brokering a rapprochement between longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in March.\n\nThe US State Department said it did not support Hamas having a role in the postwar governance of Gaza and believe the deal would have an impact on the ongoing discussions on ceasefire. It wants to see the Palestinian Authority governing \"a unified Gaza and the West Bank\" after the war because Hamas has \"the blood of innocent civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian (about 1,100), on their hands.\"\n\nWhat about the around 39,000 Palestinians who perished in the conflict since October 7, 2023? It created a mass humanitarian crisis and genocide.\n\nIsrael doesn't want Hamas in Gaza and has suggested in the face of opposition even from US that it intends to maintain control after the war. Israel's comment - instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\n\nRemember, Israel has been stepping up its attacks when ceasefire talk is advancing. It is to pressure its opponents and acted with impunity with the backing of the US in sending aid, weapons and bombs. The US government has remained uncompromising with its financial and moral support for Israel.\n\nUS has vetoed three United Nations Security Council resolutions that would have called for a ceasefire, giving various excuses.\n\nIf that is not enough, even Israeli settlers are attacking Palestinians. The latest is an attack on a group of Palestinian farmers and foreign activists accompanying them for protection in the West Bank. They were on their way to their olive fields, which they haven't been able to access since October because of attacks by settlers.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) have declared that Israel's presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal and called on Israel to end its occupation. It called on Israel to cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused.\n\nMake a guess, will Israel take heed?\n\nNow, the Israeli prime minister is in the US and has honoured him with an invitation to address Congress.\n\nUS Capitol police arrested Jewish activists calling for Israel arms embargo. The coordinated protest, led by Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), took everybody by surprise as it came together within minutes. Law enforcement moved in quickly and discarded banners decrying the \"genocide\" in Gaza and arresting people.\n\nWhat ever happened to freedom of speech and human rights and should Congress listen to the people or the Israeli prime minister?\n\nMany of them are descendants who survived ethnic cleansing and genocide. They said, our ancestors and grandparents taught us that the worst thing to do in these moments is to be a bystander.\n\nIn May, Biden called for an end to the war but at the same time, pressed on with support for Israel as leaders pledge to continue to fight until \"total victory\".\n\nA rabbi and activist said US officials are paying \"lip service\" to the ceasefire and protesters are calling for an actual end to the war and an arms embargo against Israel. Israel has carried out a genocide, armed and funded by the US Congress.\n\nNow, look at China. They are a geopolitical heavyweight with a different vision and approach for the world compared to US. In a few months, they have made historic progress in trying to make peace in the Middle East.\n\nXi Jinping has even called for an \"international peace conference\" to end the war and to be unified and struggle together against the terrible injustice.\n\nA just cause wins wide support and an unjust one condemns its pursuer to be an outcast. The hegemonic, domineering, and bullying practices of using strength to intimidate and playing zero-sum games to serve self-interest are dated. Unilateral, egoistic and regressive hegemonic practices do not blend well with the democracy and capitalistic ideas the West is advancing.\n\nWe have had enough wars and we should look for peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefits and make the world a better place to live in.\n\nBig countries should behave in a manner befitting their status and not be condescending and confrontational. Frankly, US have some soul-searching to do.", "source": {"uri": "themalaysianinsight.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "themalaysianinsight.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He commended China's efforts in facilitating this declaration, noting that it marks a pivotal moment due to China's international stature and its stance against the exclusivity policies of the United States regarding the Palestinian issue.\n\nBadran expressed appreciation for China's initiative, which he sees as crucial in addressing the American administration's bias and its partnership with the occupation forces. He underscored that the declaration is timely, given the severe situation in Gaza.\n\nAccording to Badran, the declaration clearly outlines Palestinian demands, including a ceasefire, complete withdrawal of forces from Gaza, relief efforts, and reconstruction. He highlighted that a key outcome of the meeting was the agreement to form a Palestinian national consensus government to manage affairs in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare for elections.\n\nBadran described this proposed government as an ideal solution for the Palestinian situation post-conflict, aiming to protect Palestinian interests against external interference. He also noted the commitment to address ongoing violations, support prisoners, and oppose attempts to alter the status of holy sites in al-Quds.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration, according to Badran, represents a united front among Palestinian factions and a strategic step toward confronting the occupation and ensuring Palestinian rights and sovereignty.\n\nH.H", "source": {"uri": "saba.ye", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0633\u0628\u0623\u0646\u062a - \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0633\u0628\u0623"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_front", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.saba.ye/storage/larage/e69685ba86159a954f8061172f73b7ae.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 43, "textEnd": 50}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

You may opt out at any time.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Monday clinched the pledged support of enough delegates to secure the Democratic Party's nomination for president ahead of the party's August vote, as endorsements from prominent party officials and leaders continued to pour in following U.S. President Joe Biden's Sunday announcement that he was suspending his reelection campaign.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by The Associated Press, as of late Monday, Harris had received the promised backing of more than the 1,976 delegates needed to win the nomination in the party's first round of voting, which is expected to take place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7. Pledged support is not binding, though, and is not official until delegates cast their votes.\n\n\"When I announced my campaign for president, I said I intended to go out and earn this nomination,\" Harris said in a statement. \"Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee.\"\n\nWith just over 100 days until Election Day, the Harris campaign also announced that it had received more than $100 million in donations between Sunday afternoon and Monday evening.\n\nDuring her visit to the campaign headquarters in Delaware, the president's home state, the vice president on Monday acknowledged the \"roller coaster\" situation that the country finds itself in. In a speech that left the crowd cheering, Harris also slammed former President Donald Trump, who recently accepted the Republican Party's presidential nomination after narrowly ducking an assassination attempt.\n\n\"I know Trump's type,\" Harris said, alluding to her time as a prosecutor and the attorney general of California, when she took on \"predators,\" \"cheaters,\" and \"fraudsters.\" (Harris also made similar comments at a campaign rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday.) Biden, who was still recovering from COVID-19, joined the Monday event by phone and urged the campaign staff to back the vice president and help her win the November election. (The White House said on Tuesday that Biden's symptoms have resolved and that he is now testing negative for the virus.)\n\nThe Trump campaign and political action committees that support Trump have also quickly pivoted to targeting their new opponent, launching ads accusing Harris of being an even more \"radical\" liberal than Biden and arguing that she is \"complicit\" in covering up Biden's alleged health decline.\n\nAs observers mull over who the vice president's running mate in the election will be, she has tapped former Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. to oversee her vetting process, according to Reuters, which first broke the news on Monday.\n\nPalestinian unity agreement. Hamas and Fatah, longtime rival Palestinian factions, signed an agreement in Beijing on Tuesday \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\" The unity agreement, aimed at forming an interim government to maintain Palestinian control over postwar Gaza, also involved 12 other Palestinian groups and followed reconciliation talks hosted by China that began on Sunday.\n\nThe deal, dubbed the \"Beijing Declaration,\" includes four key components: the establishment of an interim national unity government, the formation of unified Palestinian leadership ahead of future elections, the free election of a new Palestinian National Council, and a general declaration of unity in the face of ongoing Israeli attacks.\n\n\"This creates a formidable barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests in managing Palestinian affairs postwar,\" senior Hamas official Hussam Badran said, referring to the agreement.\n\nHowever, experts are skeptical that the deal will come to fruition. The announcement did not provide further details on when or how a unity government will be formed, and previous resolution attempts between Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip for over 15 years, and Fatah, which is part of the U.S.-backed Palestinian Authority, have failed since the two groups fought a brief civil war in 2007.\n\nTrouble in Kampala. Uganda's main opposition leader, Bobi Wine, said security forces stormed the headquarters of his party, the National Unity Platform, on Monday, and \"violently arrested\" party officials, ahead of a planned anti-corruption demonstration against the government. Though the Uganda Police Force did not confirm the arrests, it said it was taking precautionary steps to prevent the protest from snowballing, describing it as \"potentially anarchic.\"\n\nThe country's recent protests are aimed at denouncing alleged high-level corruption and human rights abuses under the administration of President Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled the country since 1986. Museveni has warned organizers that they are \"playing with fire\" and has deployed the police and military to various parts of the capital. Dozens of people who tried to march to the parliament building have already been arrested, but some protesters remain defiant.\n\nIndia's new budget. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's newly elected government unveiled its annual budget to Parliament on Tuesday. Following its relatively slim election victory, Modi's government, led by his Bharatiya Janata Party, aimed to cement its coalition and appease voters by prioritizing job creation and the middle class.\n\n\"India's economic growth continues to be the shining exception and will remain so in the years ahead,\" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. The budget, which totals $576 billion, earmarks $24 billion over the next five years to address the country's unemployment woes, while scaling down its fiscal deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP (as compared to its current target of 5.1 percent).\n\nThe budget also includes $18 billion to support the country's agriculture sector as well as a 5 percentage point reduction on corporate tax for foreign companies, in a bid to woo investors. Modi said the budget would shape the next five years of his term and \"become a strong foundation\" of \"a Viksit Bharat [developed India].\"\n\nReady, set, baguette!

I don't have anything at the top. I see Matt's not here. Who wants to do the honors? Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: All right. Thanks. China's foreign ministry said that Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their divisions and form an interim national unity government during negotiations in China that ended today. What's your take on this agreement?\n\nMR MILLER: So we have not yet reviewed the text of the so-called Beijing declaration. Of course, we will do that. But as we have made clear for months, Hamas is a terrorist organization - something that we obviously made clear before October 7th. But when it comes to governance of Gaza at the end of the conflict, there can't be a role for a terrorist organization. Hamas has long been a terrorist organization. They have the blood of innocent civilians - both Israeli and Palestinian - on their hands. And so when you look at the post-conflict governance of Gaza, we do see - as we have made clear, we want to see the Palestinian Authority governing a unified Gaza and the West Bank. But no, we do not support a role for Hamas.\n\nQUESTION: Blinken is set to speak with Wang Yi in Laos. Will he raise this, and what's your evaluation of China's role in these talks? Is it helpful in trying to reach a ceasefire deal?\n\nMR MILLER: So I don't have any - as I said, I don't want to pass judgment on this declaration that came out today, beyond what I just said, because we haven't reviewed the full text. I want to be - us to be able to look at it and give a more thoughtful response, which of course we will do.\n\nBut when it comes to China's role, I think as you know, the Secretary has talked to Wang Yi a number of times about playing a constructive role in Middle East diplomacy since the outbreak of the conflict. He called Wang Yi from Saudi Arabia on our very first trip to the Middle East, just a week after October 7th, and he's spoken to him on the phone a number of times, and spoke to him when we've had the occasion to travel to China, and when Wang Yi's had the occasion to travel here.\n\nAnd what we have generally encouraged China to do is to use their influence with countries in the region - especially countries with whom they have a relationship with where we don't - to discourage any escalation in the conflict. So for example, Iran, which is - continues to finance and support proxies that have launched attacks on Israel, or in the case of the Houthis, have launched attacks on commercial shipping, we have used China to use its influence to try to bring those attacks to an end, and we'll continue to do that.\n\nQUESTION: And then Israel's foreign minister said that instead of rejecting terrorism, Abbas embraces murders and rapists of Hamas. Are you concerned that this could complicate reaching a ceasefire deal, this response from Israel?\n\nMR MILLER: We don't think that anything related to this declaration should in any way have an impact on the ongoing discussions to reach a ceasefire. As you've heard us say, we think it's - an agreement is in sight. We think it's achievable. It doesn't mean we'll get there, but we have made progress in the talks. And no, I don't think either this announcement or the reaction to it should play a role in making the - making a conclusion of those talks more difficult.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks. Just on what Daphne just asked. So you're saying that it doesn't matter whether Hamas actually has a unity government with the - with this, let's say, Fatah and the other groups and so on, and basically announce that they adhere to the principles enunciated by this group, by the PLO and so on? So they have no role to play whatsoever?\n\nMR MILLER: So, Said, they have not announced that they accept the principles of the PLO. That is an important point that you make. Hamas has not renounced terrorism; it has not renounced the use of violence to achieve its political aims; it has not renounced the destruction of the state of Israel - something the PLO has done. It remains a terrorist organization. It remains committed to killing civilians. It remains committed to bringing about the destruction of the state of Israel. So no, we do not see an organization that believes in those tactics and believes in carrying out terrorism as a suitable organization to govern the Palestinian people.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. So in fact, in their statements and so on, in their discussion, in their interviews - and we have seen their spokesmen engage on Arab satellite TV all the time - and they actually say that they will go along with the principles of the PLO; they accept the two-state solution; they accept whatever agreement that can come about; they are focused on the ceasefire and achieving a ceasefire. You don't think there is anything positive in these gestures, they - the fact that they most recently spoke about a two-state solution as a solution to the conflict?\n\nMR MILLER: They have not in any way committed to a two-state solution. And I - let's just to make clear, they could have, in the context of this declaration today, signed onto the principles of the PLO, and they did not.\n\nQUESTION: Right.\n\nMR MILLER: So maybe a spokesman makes statements from time to time, but Hamas as an organization has not renounced its support for violence, its support for terrorism, or its commitment to the destruction of the state of Israel, and that's an important point.\n\nQUESTION: So just - and I don't want to belabor the issue, but looking at how much influence Hamas has had in Gaza over the past - for a very, very long time; 17, 18 years, and so on - do you see a situation where they actually can be completely taken out, or can be decapitated - as the Israelis, just to use the Israeli term and so on - from the political scene? I mean, they have -\n\nMR MILLER: So a few things about that. As you've heard us say before, we, of course, believe that Israel can achieve military aims when it comes to the defeat of Hamas, but that is different - as you make clear in your question - to political aims. And we think that ultimately the best way to ensure that Hamas does not regain strength and reassert its position inside Gaza is to offer a different political path forward for the Palestinian people. And that's what we are committed to doing. That's what we have been trying to work on with all of our partners in the region.\n\nBut I do think there's another point that deserves to be made here, Said, which is the Palestinian people in Gaza ought to have a say in this as well, got to have the foremost say in choosing who their leaders are. And I obviously can't speak for the Palestinian people, but if you look at the death and destruction that Hamas's decision to launch the attacks of October 7th has brought on Gaza, they have - there's no one that has brought more pain and suffering to the people in Gaza than Hamas through their decisions - first to launch the attacks of October 7th, and then their ongoing decision, which continues today, to hide among civilian communities and use civilians as human shields.\n\nSo that's ultimately something that the Palestinian people have to speak to and speak to through their representatives. But I will say on behalf of the United States, we do not see it in any way acceptable for a terrorist organization to play a role in governance. Because you would see what you have always seen from Hamas, which is attacks on civilians, terrorism, and a further continuation of the conflict that has plagued the people of Israel and Palestinians for decades.\n\nQUESTION: Right. Well, I agree 100 percent with you that the final say ought to be for the Palestinian people and nobody else. I agree with you with that. Let me ask you about prospects for the ceasefire. Are you inclined to believe that the Israeli prime minister may surprise everybody and announce that he agrees to the terms of the ceasefire? What is your reading of what's going on? Because, I mean, we are probably at the point where every little detail has been discussed, every iota, or every \"i\" has been dotted and every \"t\" is crossed and so on.\n\nMR MILLER: So I don't know what the prime minister will say either in his speech to Congress or in any of his other public remarks. I'll leave that to him. But the discussions continue, and there are a number of issues at play that we're still working to reach conclusion on that we have not yet reached conclusion.\n\nQUESTION: My final question is on - there is a report that Israel bombed a tent of journalists. I wonder if you know about this report. And of course, there has been something like 160 Palestinian journalists that have been killed thus far. Why is there no outrage on the fate of journalists in Gaza?\n\nMR MILLER: So I think there is a great deal of outrage about the deaths of journalists. You have heard us speak to this - not just me, but the Secretary has spoken to this - a number of times and made clear the importance we place on the work that journalists do in conflict zones around the world and, of course, especially in Gaza, where we, in many cases, the world only knows about what's happening inside Gaza because journalists, who risk their lives, put their lives on the line to bring us the news, are there every day reporting it. And so we mourn the death of any journalist, just as we mourn the death of any civilian.\n\nAnd it is why, again, we are working so hard to try to reach a ceasefire. It's why the President has put his own political muscle behind this. It's why the Secretary has worked on it. It's why others in the administration have worked on it. Because we believe ultimately the only way to stop the suffering of civilians - all civilians in Gaza, journalists, others who - other aid workers, others who do important work, as well as just people trying to go about their lives - the only way to alleviate that suffering in the daily death toll is to reach a ceasefire.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Republicans are criticizing Vice President Harris for not attending or not planning to attend Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech to a joint meeting of Congress. Tomorrow she'll be campaigning in the Midwest, but Republicans say she's boycotting the speech. Of course, there's also no public meeting right between Secretary Blinken and Netanyahu. Can you say if this is a boycott or if there are any concerns on behalf of the administration about the optics of meeting with Netanyahu publicly?\n\nMR MILLER: So Republicans are going to say what Republicans are going to say. I don't have to - I don't spend much time worrying about that, nor do I spend much time worried about optics. I worry about substance and reality, and the reality is the Vice President's office has made clear that she had a prescheduled trip before the prime minister announced this date, which is a date he decided in consultation with Congress, not with the administration. So she had pre-announced travel. And I would just ask: What is more important? Being there for a speech, or meeting with the prime minister and talking about how we can work together to address our concerns? I would posit that a meeting is more important.\n\nQUESTION: Have Israeli officials reached out with any concerns? This is the first time this has happened, the Vice President not attending a speech before a joint meeting of Congress in over three decades, I believe.\n\nQUESTION: Will there be any meetings with other members of the delegation that will come with Netanyahu? I don't know who's accompanying him, but let's say at the State Department?\n\nMR MILLER: I don't have anything to announce, but typically when you have a head of state or head of government meeting to the United States, there are always meetings that happen on the sidelines of that visit. And I would expect that to be the case here.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. Switching the topic, can you give us a sense of where things stand in terms of implementation of the REPO act, after yesterday's presidential memorandum which passes some of the authorities to the secretary of state and treasury?\n\nMR MILLER: Yeah, we are working hard on it here at the State Department. There are other agencies, the Treasury Department, who are - who have pieces that they to implement as well. I don't have details to announce today, but we're working very hard to execute the details as - and execute the responsibilities delegated to us by the President.\n\nQUESTION: There's an election. Obviously we have presidential - vice presidential --\n\nMR MILLER: No. No. As quickly - as quickly as - as quickly as possible. There's important work we have to do, and we want to get that work done as quickly as possible. We want to get it right and be thorough.\n\nQUESTION: Japan decided to pass 3 billion from proceeds from frozen Russian assets. Do you support that decision?\n\nMR MILLER: Of course we do.\n\nQUESTION: Moving to Ukraine. Ukrainian foreign minister is in Beijing today. Do you hold any hope in terms of any behavior change when it comes to China's supporting Russia in Ukraine?\n\nMR MILLER: So I'm not going to make any assessments about what might happen or try to gauge expectations of what might happen, but I do think it's important that China hear directly from Ukraine about the toll that Ukraine has suffered through Russia's war of aggression, which we know China is doing a great deal to fuel through their support for reconstituting Russia's defense industrial base.\n\nWe have always made clear that it is important that every country in the world recognize that in this conflict there's an aggressor and there's a victim. And we shouldn't treat the two parties as if they bear equal responsibility or as if this is some war that just magically popped out from nowhere without one side being responsible; and that when it comes to looking at how this war can end, it's important to remember those core principles. And so we have made that clear when we have engaged with China on the topic of the war in Ukraine. I know that other members of NATO and European countries have also made that clear to Russia. And we think it's important anytime that any country - and of course that includes China - hear directly from Ukraine.\n\nQUESTION: Do you expect engagement from the Secretary and Minister Kuleba ahead of Secretary's own meeting with China's foreign minister?\n\nMR MILLER: Well, I do not believe that Ukraine is coming to ASEAN. They're not a member of ASEAN. (Laughter.) So he does --\n\nQUESTION: A phone call.\n\nMR MILLER: So I mean, I don't quite understand the question. He does speak with Foreign Minister Kuleba all the time, and of course that will continue.\n\nQUESTION: And my final topic. Russian forces are conducting second nuclear missile launch drills in less than two months. What do you think they are doing there and what is your reaction?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. I have two questions, one on Sudan. You just released a statement on the talks that will be held in Switzerland next month. Why did the U.S. move the talks from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to Switzerland? And what do you expect from these talks?\n\nMR MILLER: So first of all, I wouldn't - I wouldn't frame it as the United States. These are talks that we hope will take place that will be cohosted by the United States, the Government of Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia. And the - the goal of these talks is to build on the work that has already taken place in Jeddah and to try to move them to the next phase.\n\nWe continue to believe there is no military solution to the conflict in Sudan, and we believe that convening these national ceasefire talks and making clear that they are backed by key international stakeholders it the only way to end the conflict in Sudan, to prevent the famine that exists there now from spreading, and to create space to restore the civilian political process. So we hope that the SAF and RSF will accept this invitation that we've extended to them. And as I said, it is not just from us; it's from the Government of Switzerland, the Government of Saudi Arabia. And I would note that these talks, should they go forward, will be joined by observers from the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Nations.\n\nQUESTION: Did you receive any response from the Sudanese parties?\n\nMR MILLER: The invitation just went today so we have not yet, but we're certainly hopeful that they will accept. We think it's important that they use this opportunity to negotiate a ceasefire, to stop this horrific conflict, and help ensure humanitarian access gets to the Sudanese people who need it.\n\nQUESTION: And on Iran, Iranian president has said today that Iran stands ready for all negotiations on nuclear program. What's your reaction?\n\nMR MILLER: So we have long made clear that we support diplomacy. We see that as the chief route to dealing with Iran's nuclear program, but we're a long way from that right now, especially when you see the steps that Iran has taken to flagrantly flout the requirements of the IAEA. And so we would hope that as a first step, Iran would come back in compliance with the demands of the IAEA that they have been, as I said, flouting here to date.\n\nMR MILLER: So let me back up and say I - while we certainly saw the comments from the new president, I do think it is important to remember that ultimately these decisions are decisions that are made by the supreme leader. And we have not made any assessment that Iran is yet changing its overall strategic approach to these issue.\n\nQUESTION: And finally on this, that means you're waiting to hear from the - from Khamenei, not from the president?\n\nQUESTION: Sorry, just to follow up on Sudan, the Jeddah talks have been unsuccessful so far. What makes you think that this format will be more successful in reaching a deal.\n\nMR MILLER: So we - the way to answer that is I can't give you any assessment on the likelihood of a deal, but we just want to get the parties back to the table. And what we determined is that bringing the parties, the three host nations, and the observers together is the best shot that we have right now at getting a nationwide cessation of violence and getting a ceasefire that would allow humanitarian actors to surge humanitarian assistance in and get back to this place where we can find a mechanism to restore the democratic transition that Sudan was on.\n\nAnd so we are looking - this is the - the Secretary spoke to this on Friday. Sudan right now, unfortunately, doesn't get all the attention it should from, I believe, the world. It certainly gets attention from us here; we know it gets attention from others in the region and others in the international community. But there is a horrific human tragedy taking place there right now, these two parties that continue to fight each other and put civilians at risk and bring civilians not just through direct harm, but harm through the humanitarian crisis that has been created.\n\nSo we're looking for anything we can do to get these talks restarted and try to get a ceasefire, and so if we can bring the weight of the United States to bear and our partner nations Switzerland and Saudi Arabia can do so as well, we think it's important to do that.\n\nQUESTION: And aside from the location, obviously, are there any changes to the format being made that you hope will help move this forward?\n\nMR MILLER: I don't want to talk about the details of the - of details of how the talks would proceed. I think it's something that we ought to hold and discuss with our partners before making those public. But ultimately, these are decisions that SAF and RSF have to make. They are the parties to the fight. They are the parties that are putting their own countrymen in such grave danger and costing the lives of so many of their innocent countrymen. And so we're going to do all we can to get these talks restarted with our partners, and we'll hope that the SAF and the RSF will come to the table for talks. They've committed to make various steps in the past and have blown through them time and time again, and so we're hopeful that this would be an opportunity to finally get our way to a ceasefire.\n\nYeah.\n\nQUESTION: Matt, thanks. Donald Trump's confirmed that Netanyahu is going to go to Mar-a-Lago tomorrow. Do you have any concerns that this meeting is happening ahead of his Congress address and also meeting with the President? I have one more after that.\n\nMR MILLER: I don't. Look, obviously we have one president at a time, and I think it's always important that everyone remember that. But at the same time, it's fairly common that heads of state and heads of government in foreign countries meet with political parties while they're here in the United States and meet with nominees for president while they're here in the United States, and we do the same thing. The Secretary has met with opposition leaders and opposition candidates a number of times in his visits around the world, so that in itself is a fairly routine event.\n\nQUESTION: And --\n\nMR MILLER: Both on behalf of other countries and on behalf of the United States.\n\nQUESTION: And one just going back to the region. There's a report about this - it's described as a secret meeting with the UAE about the Gaza day-after plan and the report - the reporting is that State Department Counselor Tom Sullivan attended. Can you confirm whether that meeting took place, and if yes, whether you can give us any more information about it?\n\nMR MILLER: So that did - meeting did take place. Tom Sullivan was in the UAE at the end of last week to advance our plans around a ceasefire and advance our plans around the day after. But as often happens - I know people will portray these meetings as secret, but oftentimes these meetings involve pretty delicate, sensitive discussions and sensitive negotiations, and there's a reason we don't make the topics of those discussions public, and I think I will decline to do so here.\n\nQUESTION: Just one more, because there's an op-ed coming from - from the Emiratis as well. Their special envoy wrote about this. She said that the plan involves deploying a temporary international mission to Gaza. Can you comment at all on whether that's accurate or --\n\nMR MILLER: No, I have not read the op-ed that you're referring to. Obviously, we have been in discussions with our partners about what security inside Gaza would look like both during a ceasefire and at the end of the conflict, but I don't want to comment on the particulars of those discussions from here.\n\nQUESTION: On the - on the day-after plans, can you give us an understanding as to how far along those plans actually are, if you guys have agreements in terms of the countries that would partake in this international force to stabilize Gaza?\n\nMR MILLER: You're stipulating as some - you're stipulating something as fact that I have not said is fact from here, but go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Well, if you would like to describe it in your own words, have at it. But just are - are these agreements still in the works? Are they almost done? Are they ready to roll out day two after a ceasefire? Just give us an understanding of where that stands.\n\nMR MILLER: So the - it really does vary when you look at each - at different aspects of what's required for Gaza. We have had a number of discussions, including fairly advanced discussions, with countries in the region about the security situation and how to address the security situation and ensure security in Gaza, and the same is true for governance. And there are proposals that we have put forward to our Arab partners. There are proposals that they have put forward to us, and we have been working through various differences, and it's - and when I say - it's not the case that every country in the region is signed up to the same plan either, right? People have different views about what the best way would be to accomplish this, and people have different political imperatives that they need to be responsive to.\n\nSo we are working through that. It has been a high priority. Barbara Leaf was in the region last week meeting with foreign ministers and other leaders. As I said - as I noted, Tom Sullivan was there on Friday. Secretary has had a number of phone calls over the past couple of weeks to talk about these plans, and I don't want to put a timetable on them other than to say it is critical that the work move forward, and that's what we are working to do.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. And then just one question on the previous question she had about Trump meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. Are you guys concerned at all about the former president trying to influence the prime minister at a moment when there are these tense, high-stake negotiations to come to a ceasefire and hostage agreement?\n\nMR MILLER: I don't know what the former president will do, just as I don't know what any private citizen will do in a meeting with the prime minister or other officials with the Government of Israel or any government. I would just say, speaking generally, that we would hope every American would --\n\nQUESTION: But there's certain things he's allowed to do and not allowed to do.\n\nMR MILLER: Hold on - yeah, sure, but I'm just - I'll just say we would hope that every American would find it in the interests of the United States to work towards a ceasefire, to work to get a ceasefire over the line, to work to get the American hostages home - remember there are still Americans who are held hostage, not just Israeli citizens, but Americans as well. And so we believe it's in the interests of everyone in the United States to try and reach a ceasefire that gets our hostages home as well as ends the suffering of Palestinians - and of course that includes Palestinian Americans who are in Gaza - and helps us build better, broader security and stability for the region.\n\nQUESTION: And can I just ask one clarifying question on that? The Hatch Act prevents citizens who don't have authority from the United States from directly or indirectly having correspondence with foreign governments to try and influence the measures or the conduct of those foreign governments.\n\nMR MILLER: I still remember - I remember little bits and pieces of it crawling around back here somewhere.\n\nQUESTION: How would you guys know if the Logan Act was violated here given you're not going to have any U.S. official in these meetings? Maybe you have a plan for getting a readout. Can you just explain to us how you know in a situation like this?\n\nMR MILLER: I think when it comes to any question about enforcement of U.S. law, I would defer entirely to the Justice Department. I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment in any way.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, very quickly - I mean, we have witnessed before - I'm old enough to remember the Reagan campaign, and they actually did influence the hostage negotiations and so on, and they delayed it. I mean, there are examples in history where actually this happened, where certain contenders do not believe that we have one president at a time. I think it's a situation that is probably kind of critical for you guys to deal with in this particular case.\n\nMR MILLER: Look, I'm not going to speak to a meeting between the former president and the prime minister. But as I said, we would hope that no American citizen of any party would do anything to jeopardize the work to bring home American hostages who have now been held in captivity for over nine months.\n\nQUESTION: On the topic of presidents, with President Biden being done in six months, does the administration - there by extension the State Department, Antony Blinken - are they at risk of losing any leverage of ending the war in Gaza or in freeing the hostages?\n\nMR MILLER: So the President is the President and brings in his conversations the full weight and authority and credibility and influence of the United States, and that has not changed and that is not going to change as long as he's President. And the same goes for the Secretary of State. And so when we have conversations with foreign governments, we always make clear our position and the things that we are willing to do to stand by our position, and that will be the case.\n\nQUESTION: If I may - if you'll indulge me, please, on Nicaragua. I know it's totally separate, but can I --\n\nMR MILLER: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Okay, thank you. Religious freedom in Nicaragua - a couple questions. USCIRF - you're - I'm sure you're familiar with it - the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, they say religious freedom conditions in Nicaragua are getting worse, deteriorating. In fact, USCIRF is holding a virtual hearing tomorrow to discuss the situation in Nicaragua, religious freedom. First question: Will the State Department be in attendance at that virtual meeting?\n\nMR MILLER: I don't know the answer to that. I'm happy to check and get back to you.\n\nQUESTION: Two: U.S. - USCIRF said recently, quote, \"Nicaragua's government continues to repress the Catholic Church for its human rights advocacy by arbitrarily arresting, imprisoning, and exiling clergy and laypeople and shuttering and seizing the property of Catholic charitable and educational organizations.\" In fact, just recently Ortega shut down Radio Mar\u00eda Nicaragua. That all said, what more can the U.S. do right now, this moment, to help those in Nicaragua being persecuted for their faith?\n\nMR MILLER: So you have seen us on a number of occasions speak out about the persecution of religious figures in Nicaragua and call for the release of religious figures, and we will continue to do that.\n\nQUESTION: But do you see - is Ortega listening?\n\nMR MILLER: I will say that it's not just something that we speak out on but that we work with our partners in the region to accomplish. It is a high priority for us, the exercise of freedom of religion both in Nicaragua and all around the world.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. Today Secretary Blinken met with the Yezidi society leaders here at the State Department. And the Yezidi communities, since 10 years ago when they faced the genocide, they never been so vulnerable as they are now. Unable to go back to their homes and also they are living in a dire situation in IDP camps in the Kurdistan region. The so-called Shingal Agreement has not and no longer being implemented. What's the U.S. firm position on the Yezidi situation in the region and also the Shingal Agreement? Do you still have the faith in that agreement?\n\nMR MILLER: So we do believe that the Sinjar Agreement was an important start for supporting those targeted in the 2014 genocide committed by ISIS. But as you note, the agreement has not yet been fully implemented, which must be done in partnership with local communities, including the Yezidis. We continue to encourage the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government to implement the tenants of the Sinjar Agreement, including security, governance, and reconstruction in Sinjar. The upcoming 10th anniversary of the ISIS genocide represents an important moment to demonstrate meaningful progress, and that's what the Secretary discussed with those with whom he met today.\n\nQUESTION: And I think you know that the Shingal is a disputed area between two governments, Erbil and Baghdad, and there are several militia groups have control over the area. And this has - political infighting has prevented the reconstruction of the city. So what the role - what roles the U.S. can play in bringing this situation to an end and also give a relief to the Yezidi communities?\n\nMR MILLER: So for - protection for vulnerable ethnic and religious communities in Iraq has always been a priority for the State Department. Since 2018 the United States has provided over $500 million in assistance to religious and ethnic minority communities that were targeted for genocide. We provide a significant amount of U.S. humanitarian assistance on the basis of need regardless of ethnic or religious affiliation in addition, and we continue to advocate for the security of Sinjar to be in the hands of federal police and Iraqi Security Forces, including the local police force established under the Sinjar Agreement.\n\nYeah.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, sir. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is here, and there is a big protest planned for tomorrow outside the Capitol Hill. At the same time --\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. Yeah. At the same time, there are large groups expected in favor of Netanyahu also. The local media reports that there is a possibility of clash and disturbance on the streets of D.C. tomorrow. What are your thoughts on that? What is your message to the protesters coming here from different states?\n\nMR MILLER: So look, we - as you hear us say when we talk about protests around the world - and typically we from the State Department don't talk about domestic matters; there are other agencies inside the U.S. Government that do so - but of course we think all protests should be held peacefully. We support the right of Americans to protest. It's one of the things that makes America great and strengthens our democracy, and so - is people speaking their minds either to the United States Government - to United States Government officials or to foreign government officials who are in town. We support people's right to do that. But of course those protests in any event should remain peaceful.\n\nQUESTION: The Pakistani Government was deporting millions of Afghan refugees, but on the intervention of UN and United States, Pakistani Government extended their stay for one more year. What are your thoughts on this decision, and what is your - what is your comment on the situation of Afghan refugees in Pakistan?\n\nQUESTION: Sir, Pakistani - on the direction of Pakistani Government, the police raided the offices of a political party and arrested the spokesperson. They're also trying to ban this political party. You spoke about it last week, but what is your reaction on the raids on the offices of the political party and arrest of their spokesperson?\n\nMR MILLER: So we have seen the reports of the arrests of PTI leaders. We are always concerned when we see arrests of opposition leaders. I'm always personally concerned when I see the arrest of a spokesperson. (Laughter.) We support the peaceful upholding of constitutional and democratic principles, including the rule of law, equal justice under the law, and respect for human rights like freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly. And we urge that these principles be respected in accordance with Pakistan's constitution and laws.\n\nGo ahead - yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Matt. Thank you, everyone, and good afternoon. (Inaudible) who are sitting here. My name is Niranira (ph). I'm from Bangladesh and I'm proud Bangladeshi American living in this country last 24 years. I live in New York. I come here to talk one thing. The running president in my country, what he is doing, the way we speak every time, thousand of students are killing, and especially women students - they got raped, killed under that prime minister we call illegal, which is true. He is illegal, unelected Prime Minister Hasina Sheikh - what he is doing in my country right now. Is my concern - I know that concern of USA and always we believe is superpower, and I living in this country, and my - what I say, what I can help from you for my country, Bangladesh. (Inaudible) see my country Bangladesh slide and everything is (inaudible). Thank you.\n\nMR MILLER: So we continue to closely follow developments in Bangladesh and call for calm and de-escalation. And as I said yesterday, we condemn any acts of violence, whether they be acts of violence committed against peaceful protesters or they be acts of violence committed by people who are protesting the actions of the government. We support peaceful assembly. We support peaceful protests. But in all cases, they ought to be carried out peacefully, and the government should refrain from acts of violence against peaceful protesters.\n\nBut I would say that when it comes to Bangladesh, we also remain deeply concerned by reports of ongoing telecommunications disruptions across the country which limit the ability of people in Bangladesh, including American citizens there, to access critical information. That's something we have spoken out against in other countries, and we speak out against it when it comes to Bangladesh as well, and we'll continue to make those concerns known.\n\nQUESTION: Yesterday I informed you that there is thousands of people are getting killed under the direction of Hasina Sheikh, the legal prime minister of Bangladesh. Last night I learned the tank and vehicle with the logo of United Nations are being used and they are firing from those UN carrying a logo vehicle and killing innocent student. Also there is a helicopter on the sky; they're also killing innocent civilians. It's like country is going into a civil war, number one.\n\nAnd number two, some public figure name Nurul Haq, the president of Gono Odhikar Parishad, and there is another leader Tarique Rahma, then another leader Zonayed Saki, then another leader Abu Adnan Taha - everyone is getting kidnapped by the government forces and they are taking advantage because there is no internet, there is no telephone communication, and prime minister is sitting down at Ganabhaban and directing police, army, RAB, and other law enforcement agencies just keep killing because world cannot watch what is going on. I know Europe satellite and American satellite cannot take the picture because there is no internet.\n\nAnd I have third question if you allow me. America is the proponent of democracy and institution of democracy in all over the world. We respect that. But under the direction of General Asim Munir of Pakistan and the chief justice of Faez Isa, they are destroying every single democratic institution in Pakistan. There is no reflection of the people's choice in Pakistan. Do you think America other than showing concern and expect something, do you think that country is on the right direction?\n\nMR MILLER: So I think that the - what we as the United States have always done - and I should say what we have always done when we are at our best - is to speak out for democratic values around the world and make sure that - or - and make clear that countries are strongest when they uphold democratic values - countries anywhere in the world. And that's what we're going to continue to do. That's our greatest strength, and it's what will continue to guide our approach.\n\nDo you have another one?\n\nQUESTION: Do you think Hasina Sheikh and the operatives in Pakistan, they are listening what American, European governments are asking them to do?\n\nMR MILLER: So we will continue to make our priorities clear. We will continue to make our values clear. Does every country in the United - or in the world do exactly what the United States or any country in Europe or any other country around the world thinks they ought to do or thinks how they ought to handle every situation? Of course not. Sovereign countries make their own decisions. They always have. They always will.\n\nWhat we can do is impress upon countries what we believe are the right way to approach questions of fundamental freedom, questions of democratic values, questions of human rights, and bring all the influence we can to bear to urge them along that path. And that's what we'll continue to do.\n\nQUESTION: But would you like to make a comment that they're using United Nations logo on the Humvees and tank and they are firing from that vehicle into the civilian and thousands of people are getting killed? Why they are using United Nations logo?\n\nMR MILLER: So I am not aware of that specific report. You should address that to the United Nations, I would think. But I would say, as I have made clear, we condemn any violence against peaceful protests. Protesters should be allowed to carry out their fundamental freedom of expression, their fundamental freedom of speech. And at the same time, we urge that all protests be peaceful.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. I'll be on a different topic. How would you describe Secretary Blinken's relationship with Vice President Harris?\n\nMR MILLER: He has an extremely close working relationship with the Vice President. He's actually known her for more than 10 years, worked with her before she became Vice President, before he became Secretary of State. He spoke to some of this this morning when he talked about how he's seen her inside the Oval Office, inside the Situation Room and overseas asking tough questions about difficult issues and really getting to the heart of some of the difficult foreign policy choices that we face, and that he has been impressed by her both command of various foreign policy issues, but just as importantly her insights into getting at what really can be the nub of an issue and try to determine how we as a nation can move forward in a way that serves the American people.\n\nQUESTION: And would he be interested in continuing to serve under a potential Harris administration?\n\nMR MILLER: Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. There's an election that's going to take place. I'm not going to comment on the election. I think we should take things one day at a time.\n\nYeah.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. I don't claim to be an expert on this, but there's a British musician called Charli who has described Kamala Harris as \"brat.\" (Laughter.) She did give an interview to the BBC saying - explaining what that term means. She said she feels like - talking about Kamala here - \"feels like herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it's brat. You're brat. That's brat.\" I just wondered if you had any comment on that as the possible future of the president, or if that affects foreign policy at all.\n\nMR MILLER: My comment is I think - I think I am officially aged out of participating in this conversation. (Laughter.) And I'm trying to think of anything I could say that wouldn't make me look worse for having - saying it, and I'm coming up with nothing. So I think some things are better left to a younger generation to comment on, and I'm certainly not that.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you so very much. I'm not sure if someone already asked about this, but it's about the U.S. troops withdrawal from the Iraq, as number of media reports suggest that Iraqi officials, Iraqi Government, they want complete withdrawal of U.S. forces. And we have seen months before U.S. hosted top Iraqi official regarding this. So the question is with this intense and panicked situation in the Middle East, the U.S. is ready to do for the base, and there is specific quantities, specific numbers, U.S. are to keep their - this withdrawal process.\n\nMR MILLER: So I would refer you to the Department of Defense to comment on that in detail. But as we have said before, we are committed to the Higher Military Commission, which is a process that is taking place in Baghdad to determine how and when the coalition's military mission will transition. And we've spoken this before - to this before, and nothing has changed.\n\nQUESTION: Secondly, the Pakistani recent military spokesperson highlighted three things I asked before and my senior colleague, Mr. Afridi, asked many times, that is regarding the digital terrorism that Pakistani military spokesperson is mentioning again and again. And that is - that is all about the - all those vocals who are supporting Imran Khan and his party and everything and all that. Secondly, he highlighted the number of operations Pakistani military is doing all day in 24 hours. That is between hundreds - 60 to 80 operations he mentioned.\n\nSo there are two questions. So I already asked before that the (inaudible) Pakistani Government (inaudible) to curtail media freedoms, social media freedom. And secondly, the Pakistani officials - the security officials, they are again hinting more U.S. military assistance or something like that. So you have anything on that?\n\nMR MILLER: So with respect to the first question, as I've spoken to with respect to other countries, we support media freedom in Pakistan, just as we support it around the world. And with the second, I don't have any announcements to make today.\n\nWith that, I think we'll wrap for today.

What we care about is morality, and what we call for is Justice\".\n\nWang Yi said, \"The Palestinian issue, which lasted for more than seven decades without a solution, has served as a test for international justice, fairness, conscience and morals for humanity. Currently, the conflict in the Gaza Strip continues, the repercussions resulting from it are still extending, and the region is witnessing many intertwined conflicts.\"\n\n\"In order to get out of the current predicament, the Chinese side proposes a three-step initiative, the first is to promote a comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible and ensure humanitarian assistance and relief access.

Khan Younis, the southern refuge of already displaced Palestinians, is on fire as the latest battleground. The US loves war so much that it is hosting the genocidal Prime Minister of Israel, exerting none of its influence to call for an end to the killing of innocent civilians.\n\nContrary to this warmongering stance is China, which recently brought together the 14 Palestinian factions to sign a peace and reconciliation declaration - the Beijing Declaration. This agreement ends the long-standing enmity between Palestine's Hamas and Fatah factions and lays down a peaceful plan to govern Gaza and the West Bank post-conflict. China, in doing so, has clearly established itself as a peacemaker, while the US stands to protect its military-industrial complex. China's act is a reaffirmation to all countries that have recognized Palestine as a state, including Pakistan.\n\nLauded and welcomed by the pro-Palestine world and the Prime Minister of Pakistan, China's diplomacy has surpassed the efforts of those countries attempting to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas. By uniting Palestinian factions, China has confirmed that no one can erase Palestine and that only its indigenous people have the right to rule its territory. This strengthens Palestine's moral high ground in the ongoing conflict with Israel and sends a clear message that there will be two states, not one.\n\nThis mediation effort by China is one of many instances where the country has stood for peace, as opposed to war and conflict, silencing critics who have long misread China's rise as chaotic.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.nation.com.pk/assets/thenation_202006/images/no-image-large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756938", "eventUri": "eng-9756938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

This information has recently been updated, and is now available.\n\nDepartment Press Briefing - July 23, 2024 [ https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-23-2024/ ] 07/23/2024 05:30 PM EDT\n\nMatthew Miller, Department Spokesperson\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nHome [ https://www.state.gov ]Department Press Briefing - July 23, 2024 hide\n\nDepartment Press Briefing - July 23, 2024\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\n1:25 p.m. EDT\n\n*MR MILLER:* Good afternoon. I don't have anything at the top. I see Matt's not here. Who wants to do the honors? Go ahead.\n\n*QUESTION:* All right. Thanks. China's foreign ministry said that Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their divisions and form an interim national unity government during negotiations in China that ended today. What's your take on this agreement?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So we have not yet reviewed the text of the so-called Beijing declaration. Of course, we will do that. But as we have made clear for months, Hamas is a terrorist organization - something that we obviously made clear before October 7th. But when it comes to governance of Gaza at the end of the conflict, there can't be a role for a terrorist organization. Hamas has long been a terrorist organization. They have the blood of innocent civilians - both Israeli and Palestinian - on their hands. And so when you look at the post-conflict governance of Gaza, we do see - as we have made clear, we want to see the Palestinian Authority governing a unified Gaza and the West Bank. But no, we do not support a role for Hamas.\n\n*QUESTION:* Blinken is set to speak with Wang Yi in Laos. Will he raise this, and what's your evaluation of China's role in these talks? Is it helpful in trying to reach a ceasefire deal?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So I don't have any - as I said, I don't want to pass judgment on this declaration that came out today, beyond what I just said, because we haven't reviewed the full text. I want to be - us to be able to look at it and give a more thoughtful response, which of course we will do.\n\nBut when it comes to China's role, I think as you know, the Secretary has talked to Wang Yi a number of times about playing a constructive role in Middle East diplomacy since the outbreak of the conflict. He called Wang Yi from Saudi Arabia on our very first trip to the Middle East, just a week after October 7th, and he's spoken to him on the phone a number of times, and spoke to him when we've had the occasion to travel to China, and when Wang Yi's had the occasion to travel here.\n\nAnd what we have generally encouraged China to do is to use their influence with countries in the region - especially countries with whom they have a relationship with where we don't - to discourage any escalation in the conflict. So for example, Iran, which is - continues to finance and support proxies that have launched attacks on Israel, or in the case of the Houthis, have launched attacks on commercial shipping, we have used China to use its influence to try to bring those attacks to an end, and we'll continue to do that.\n\n*QUESTION:* And then Israel's foreign minister said that instead of rejecting terrorism, Abbas embraces murders and rapists of Hamas. Are you concerned that this could complicate reaching a ceasefire deal, this response from Israel?\n\n*MR MILLER:* We don't think that anything related to this declaration should in any way have an impact on the ongoing discussions to reach a ceasefire. As you've heard us say, we think it's - an agreement is in sight. We think it's achievable. It doesn't mean we'll get there, but we have made progress in the talks. And no, I don't think either this announcement or the reaction to it should play a role in making the - making a conclusion of those talks more difficult.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thanks.\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thanks. Just on what Daphne just asked. So you're saying that it doesn't matter whether Hamas actually has a unity government with the - with this, let's say, Fatah and the other groups and so on, and basically announce that they adhere to the principles enunciated by this group, by the PLO and so on? So they have no role to play whatsoever?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So, Said, they have not announced that they accept the principles of the PLO. That is an important point that you make. Hamas has not renounced terrorism; it has not renounced the use of violence to achieve its political aims; it has not renounced the destruction of the state of Israel - something the PLO has done. It remains a terrorist organization. It remains committed to killing civilians. It remains committed to bringing about the destruction of the state of Israel. So no, we do not see an organization that believes in those tactics and believes in carrying out terrorism as a suitable organization to govern the Palestinian people.\n\n*QUESTION:* Okay. So in fact, in their statements and so on, in their discussion, in their interviews - and we have seen their spokesmen engage on Arab satellite TV all the time - and they actually say that they will go along with the principles of the PLO; they accept the two-state solution; they accept whatever agreement that can come about; they are focused on the ceasefire and achieving a ceasefire. You don't think there is anything positive in these gestures, they - the fact that they most recently spoke about a two-state solution as a solution to the conflict?\n\n*MR MILLER:* They have not in any way committed to a two-state solution. And I - let's just to make clear, they could have, in the context of this declaration today, signed onto the principles of the PLO, and they did not.\n\n*QUESTION:* Right.\n\n*MR MILLER:* So maybe a spokesman makes statements from time to time, but Hamas as an organization has not renounced its support for violence, its support for terrorism, or its commitment to the destruction of the state of Israel, and that's an important point.\n\n*QUESTION:* So just - and I don't want to belabor the issue, but looking at how much influence Hamas has had in Gaza over the past - for a very, very long time; 17, 18 years, and so on - do you see a situation where they actually can be completely taken out, or can be decapitated - as the Israelis, just to use the Israeli term and so on - from the political scene? I mean, they have -\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah. So -\n\n*QUESTION:* They are embedded in the society itself.\n\n*MR MILLER:* So a few things about that. As you've heard us say before, we, of course, believe that Israel can achieve military aims when it comes to the defeat of Hamas, but that is different - as you make clear in your question - to political aims. And we think that ultimately the best way to ensure that Hamas does not regain strength and reassert its position inside Gaza is to offer a different political path forward for the Palestinian people. And that's what we are committed to doing. That's what we have been trying to work on with all of our partners in the region.\n\nBut I do think there's another point that deserves to be made here, Said, which is the Palestinian people in Gaza ought to have a say in this as well, got to have the foremost say in choosing who their leaders are. And I obviously can't speak for the Palestinian people, but if you look at the death and destruction that Hamas's decision to launch the attacks of October 7th has brought on Gaza, they have - there's no one that has brought more pain and suffering to the people in Gaza than Hamas through their decisions - first to launch the attacks of October 7th, and then their ongoing decision, which continues today, to hide among civilian communities and use civilians as human shields.\n\nSo that's ultimately something that the Palestinian people have to speak to and speak to through their representatives. But I will say on behalf of the United States, we do not see it in any way acceptable for a terrorist organization to play a role in governance. Because you would see what you have always seen from Hamas, which is attacks on civilians, terrorism, and a further continuation of the conflict that has plagued the people of Israel and Palestinians for decades.\n\n*QUESTION:* Right. Well, I agree 100 percent with you that the final say ought to be for the Palestinian people and nobody else. I agree with you with that. Let me ask you about prospects for the ceasefire. Are you inclined to believe that the Israeli prime minister may surprise everybody and announce that he agrees to the terms of the ceasefire? What is your reading of what's going on? Because, I mean, we are probably at the point where every little detail has been discussed, every iota, or every \"i\" has been dotted and every \"t\" is crossed and so on.\n\n*MR MILLER:* So I don't know what the prime minister will say either in his speech to Congress or in any of his other public remarks. I'll leave that to him. But the discussions continue, and there are a number of issues at play that we're still working to reach conclusion on that we have not yet reached conclusion.\n\n*QUESTION:* My final question is on - there is a report that Israel bombed a tent of journalists. I wonder if you know about this report. And of course, there has been something like 160 Palestinian journalists that have been killed thus far. Why is there no outrage on the fate of journalists in Gaza?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So I think there is a great deal of outrage about the deaths of journalists. You have heard us speak to this - not just me, but the Secretary has spoken to this - a number of times and made clear the importance we place on the work that journalists do in conflict zones around the world and, of course, especially in Gaza, where we, in many cases, the world only knows about what's happening inside Gaza because journalists, who risk their lives, put their lives on the line to bring us the news, are there every day reporting it. And so we mourn the death of any journalist, just as we mourn the death of any civilian.\n\nAnd it is why, again, we are working so hard to try to reach a ceasefire. It's why the President has put his own political muscle behind this. It's why the Secretary has worked on it. It's why others in the administration have worked on it. Because we believe ultimately the only way to stop the suffering of civilians - all civilians in Gaza, journalists, others who - other aid workers, others who do important work, as well as just people trying to go about their lives - the only way to alleviate that suffering in the daily death toll is to reach a ceasefire.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you.\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you. Republicans are criticizing Vice President Harris for not attending or not planning to attend Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech to a joint meeting of Congress. Tomorrow she'll be campaigning in the Midwest, but Republicans say she's boycotting the speech. Of course, there's also no public meeting right between Secretary Blinken and Netanyahu. Can you say if this is a boycott or if there are any concerns on behalf of the administration about the optics of meeting with Netanyahu publicly?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So Republicans are going to say what Republicans are going to say. I don't have to - I don't spend much time worrying about that, nor do I spend much time worried about optics. I worry about substance and reality, and the reality is the Vice President's office has made clear that she had a prescheduled trip before the prime minister announced this date, which is a date he decided in consultation with Congress, not with the administration. So she had pre-announced travel. And I would just ask: What is more important? Being there for a speech, or meeting with the prime minister and talking about how we can work together to address our concerns? I would posit that a meeting is more important.\n\n*QUESTION:* Have Israeli officials reached out with any concerns? This is the first time this has happened, the Vice President not attending a speech before a joint meeting of Congress in over three decades, I believe.\n\n*MR MILLER:* Not that I'm aware of.\n\n*QUESTION:* Just to follow up on --\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah.\n\n*QUESTION:* Will there be any meetings with other members of the delegation that will come with Netanyahu? I don't know who's accompanying him, but let's say at the State Department?\n\n*MR MILLER:* I don't have anything to announce, but typically when you have a head of state or head of government meeting to the United States, there are always meetings that happen on the sidelines of that visit. And I would expect that to be the case here.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you.\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you, Matt. Switching the topic, can you give us a sense of where things stand in terms of implementation of the REPO act, after yesterday's presidential memorandum which passes some of the authorities to the secretary of state and treasury?\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah, we are working hard on it here at the State Department. There are other agencies, the Treasury Department, who are - who have pieces that they to implement as well. I don't have details to announce today, but we're working very hard to execute the details as - and execute the responsibilities delegated to us by the President.\n\n*QUESTION:* Do you have a timetable?\n\n*MR MILLER:* No. No.\n\n*QUESTION:* There's an election. Obviously we have presidential - vice presidential --\n\n*MR MILLER:* No. No. As quickly - as quickly as - as quickly as possible. There's important work we have to do, and we want to get that work done as quickly as possible. We want to get it right and be thorough.\n\n*QUESTION:* Japan decided to pass 3 billion from proceeds from frozen Russian assets. Do you support that decision?\n\n*MR MILLER:* Of course we do.\n\n*QUESTION:* Moving to Ukraine. Ukrainian foreign minister is in Beijing today. Do you hold any hope in terms of any behavior change when it comes to China's supporting Russia in Ukraine?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So I'm not going to make any assessments about what might happen or try to gauge expectations of what might happen, but I do think it's important that China hear directly from Ukraine about the toll that Ukraine has suffered through Russia's war of aggression, which we know China is doing a great deal to fuel through their support for reconstituting Russia's defense industrial base.\n\nWe have always made clear that it is important that every country in the world recognize that in this conflict there's an aggressor and there's a victim. And we shouldn't treat the two parties as if they bear equal responsibility or as if this is some war that just magically popped out from nowhere without one side being responsible; and that when it comes to looking at how this war can end, it's important to remember those core principles. And so we have made that clear when we have engaged with China on the topic of the war in Ukraine. I know that other members of NATO and European countries have also made that clear to Russia. And we think it's important anytime that any country - and of course that includes China - hear directly from Ukraine.\n\n*QUESTION:* Do you expect engagement from the Secretary and Minister Kuleba ahead of Secretary's own meeting with China's foreign minister?\n\n*MR MILLER:* Well, I do not believe that Ukraine is coming to ASEAN. They're not a member of ASEAN. (Laughter.) So he does --\n\n*QUESTION:* A phone call.\n\n*MR MILLER:* So I mean, I don't quite understand the question. He does speak with Foreign Minister Kuleba all the time, and of course that will continue.\n\n*QUESTION:* Do you expect any call within this --\n\n*MR MILLER:* I don't have any calls to announce, Alex.\n\n*QUESTION:* And my final topic. Russian forces are conducting second nuclear missile launch drills in less than two months. What do you think they are doing there and what is your reaction?\n\n*MR MILLER:* I don't have any assessment for that from here.\n\nYeah, go ahead, Michel.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you. I have two questions, one on Sudan. You just released a statement on the talks that will be held in Switzerland next month. Why did the U.S. move the talks from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to Switzerland? And what do you expect from these talks?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So first of all, I wouldn't - I wouldn't frame it as the United States. These are talks that we hope will take place that will be cohosted by the United States, the Government of Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia. And the - the goal of these talks is to build on the work that has already taken place in Jeddah and to try to move them to the next phase.\n\nWe continue to believe there is no military solution to the conflict in Sudan, and we believe that convening these national ceasefire talks and making clear that they are backed by key international stakeholders it the only way to end the conflict in Sudan, to prevent the famine that exists there now from spreading, and to create space to restore the civilian political process. So we hope that the SAF and RSF will accept this invitation that we've extended to them. And as I said, it is not just from us; it's from the Government of Switzerland, the Government of Saudi Arabia. And I would note that these talks, should they go forward, will be joined by observers from the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Nations.\n\n*QUESTION:* Did you receive any response from the Sudanese parties?\n\n*MR MILLER:* The invitation just went today so we have not yet, but we're certainly hopeful that they will accept. We think it's important that they use this opportunity to negotiate a ceasefire, to stop this horrific conflict, and help ensure humanitarian access gets to the Sudanese people who need it.\n\n*QUESTION:* And on Iran, Iranian president has said today that Iran stands ready for all negotiations on nuclear program. What's your reaction?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So we have long made clear that we support diplomacy. We see that as the chief route to dealing with Iran's nuclear program, but we're a long way from that right now, especially when you see the steps that Iran has taken to flagrantly flout the requirements of the IAEA. And so we would hope that as a first step, Iran would come back in compliance with the demands of the IAEA that they have been, as I said, flouting here to date.\n\n*QUESTION:* Does it mean --\n\n*MR MILLER:* Sorry. Go ahead, Michel.\n\n*QUESTION:* -- that you're not ready for talks with the new president?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So let me back up and say I - while we certainly saw the comments from the new president, I do think it is important to remember that ultimately these decisions are decisions that are made by the supreme leader. And we have not made any assessment that Iran is yet changing its overall strategic approach to these issue.\n\n*QUESTION:* And finally on this, that means you're waiting to hear from the - from Khamenei, not from the president?\n\n*MR MILLER:* I don't have anything to add beyond what I just said on that. So --\n\n*QUESTION:* Thanks.\n\n*QUESTION:* Sorry, just to follow up on Sudan, the Jeddah talks have been unsuccessful so far. What makes you think that this format will be more successful in reaching a deal.\n\n*MR MILLER:* So we - the way to answer that is I can't give you any assessment on the likelihood of a deal, but we just want to get the parties back to the table. And what we determined is that bringing the parties, the three host nations, and the observers together is the best shot that we have right now at getting a nationwide cessation of violence and getting a ceasefire that would allow humanitarian actors to surge humanitarian assistance in and get back to this place where we can find a mechanism to restore the democratic transition that Sudan was on.\n\nAnd so we are looking - this is the - the Secretary spoke to this on Friday. Sudan right now, unfortunately, doesn't get all the attention it should from, I believe, the world. It certainly gets attention from us here; we know it gets attention from others in the region and others in the international community. But there is a horrific human tragedy taking place there right now, these two parties that continue to fight each other and put civilians at risk and bring civilians not just through direct harm, but harm through the humanitarian crisis that has been created.\n\nSo we're looking for anything we can do to get these talks restarted and try to get a ceasefire, and so if we can bring the weight of the United States to bear and our partner nations Switzerland and Saudi Arabia can do so as well, we think it's important to do that.\n\n*QUESTION:* And aside from the location, obviously, are there any changes to the format being made that you hope will help move this forward?\n\n*MR MILLER:* I don't want to talk about the details of the - of details of how the talks would proceed. I think it's something that we ought to hold and discuss with our partners before making those public. But ultimately, these are decisions that SAF and RSF have to make. They are the parties to the fight. They are the parties that are putting their own countrymen in such grave danger and costing the lives of so many of their innocent countrymen. And so we're going to do all we can to get these talks restarted with our partners, and we'll hope that the SAF and the RSF will come to the table for talks. They've committed to make various steps in the past and have blown through them time and time again, and so we're hopeful that this would be an opportunity to finally get our way to a ceasefire.\n\nYeah.\n\n*QUESTION:* Matt, thanks. Donald Trump's confirmed that Netanyahu is going to go to Mar-a-Lago tomorrow. Do you have any concerns that this meeting is happening ahead of his Congress address and also meeting with the President? I have one more after that.\n\n*MR MILLER:* I don't. Look, obviously we have one president at a time, and I think it's always important that everyone remember that. But at the same time, it's fairly common that heads of state and heads of government in foreign countries meet with political parties while they're here in the United States and meet with nominees for president while they're here in the United States, and we do the same thing. The Secretary has met with opposition leaders and opposition candidates a number of times in his visits around the world, so that in itself is a fairly routine event.\n\n*QUESTION:* And --\n\n*MR MILLER:* Both on behalf of other countries and on behalf of the United States.\n\n*QUESTION:* And one just going back to the region. There's a report about this - it's described as a secret meeting with the UAE about the Gaza day-after plan and the report - the reporting is that State Department Counselor Tom Sullivan attended. Can you confirm whether that meeting took place, and if yes, whether you can give us any more information about it?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So that did - meeting did take place. Tom Sullivan was in the UAE at the end of last week to advance our plans around a ceasefire and advance our plans around the day after. But as often happens - I know people will portray these meetings as secret, but oftentimes these meetings involve pretty delicate, sensitive discussions and sensitive negotiations, and there's a reason we don't make the topics of those discussions public, and I think I will decline to do so here.\n\n*QUESTION:* Just one more, because there's an op-ed coming from - from the Emiratis as well. Their special envoy wrote about this. She said that the plan involves deploying a temporary international mission to Gaza. Can you comment at all on whether that's accurate or --\n\n*MR MILLER:* No, I have not read the op-ed that you're referring to. Obviously, we have been in discussions with our partners about what security inside Gaza would look like both during a ceasefire and at the end of the conflict, but I don't want to comment on the particulars of those discussions from here.\n\n*QUESTION:* Follow-up on Gaza?\n\n*QUESTION:* Just a follow-up on that?\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah, go ahead.\n\n*QUESTION:* On the - on the day-after plans, can you give us an understanding as to how far along those plans actually are, if you guys have agreements in terms of the countries that would partake in this international force to stabilize Gaza?\n\n*MR MILLER:* You're stipulating as some - you're stipulating something as fact that I have not said is fact from here, but go ahead.\n\n*QUESTION:* Okay.\n\n*MR MILLER:* (Laughter.)\n\n*QUESTION:* Well, if you would like to describe it in your own words, have at it. But just are - are these agreements still in the works? Are they almost done? Are they ready to roll out day two after a ceasefire? Just give us an understanding of where that stands.\n\n*MR MILLER:* So the - it really does vary when you look at each - at different aspects of what's required for Gaza. We have had a number of discussions, including fairly advanced discussions, with countries in the region about the security situation and how to address the security situation and ensure security in Gaza, and the same is true for governance. And there are proposals that we have put forward to our Arab partners. There are proposals that they have put forward to us, and we have been working through various differences, and it's - and when I say - it's not the case that every country in the region is signed up to the same plan either, right? People have different views about what the best way would be to accomplish this, and people have different political imperatives that they need to be responsive to.\n\nSo we are working through that. It has been a high priority. Barbara Leaf was in the region last week meeting with foreign ministers and other leaders. As I said - as I noted, Tom Sullivan was there on Friday. Secretary has had a number of phone calls over the past couple of weeks to talk about these plans, and I don't want to put a timetable on them other than to say it is critical that the work move forward, and that's what we are working to do.\n\n*QUESTION:* Okay. And then just one question on the previous question she had about Trump meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. Are you guys concerned at all about the former president trying to influence the prime minister at a moment when there are these tense, high-stake negotiations to come to a ceasefire and hostage agreement?\n\n*MR MILLER:* I don't know what the former president will do, just as I don't know what any private citizen will do in a meeting with the prime minister or other officials with the Government of Israel or any government. I would just say, speaking generally, that we would hope every American would --\n\n*QUESTION:* But there's certain things he's allowed to do and not allowed to do.\n\n*MR MILLER:* Hold on - yeah, sure, but I'm just - I'll just say we would hope that every American would find it in the interests of the United States to work towards a ceasefire, to work to get a ceasefire over the line, to work to get the American hostages home - remember there are still Americans who are held hostage, not just Israeli citizens, but Americans as well. And so we believe it's in the interests of everyone in the United States to try and reach a ceasefire that gets our hostages home as well as ends the suffering of Palestinians - and of course that includes Palestinian Americans who are in Gaza - and helps us build better, broader security and stability for the region.\n\n*QUESTION:* And can I just ask one clarifying question on that? The Hatch Act prevents citizens who don't have authority from the United States from directly or indirectly having correspondence with foreign governments to try and influence the measures or the conduct of those foreign governments.\n\n*MR MILLER:* I think that's the Logan Act. Is that the Hatch Act or the Logan Act?\n\n*QUESTION:* I mean - sorry, it's the Logan Act, yeah.\n\n*MR MILLER:* The Logan Act, yeah. My old DOJ hat on here.\n\n*QUESTION:* I'm - yeah, I'm thinking Hatch Act - yes, thank you.\n\n*MR MILLER:* I still remember - I remember little bits and pieces of it crawling around back here somewhere.\n\n*QUESTION:* How would you guys know if the Logan Act was violated here given you're not going to have any U.S. official in these meetings? Maybe you have a plan for getting a readout. Can you just explain to us how you know in a situation like this?\n\n*MR MILLER:* I think when it comes to any question about enforcement of U.S. law, I would defer entirely to the Justice Department. I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment in any way.\n\n*QUESTION:* Okay.\n\n*QUESTION:* Follow-up on Gaza?\n\n*QUESTION:* Can I just - one point --\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah. I'll come to you next, but go ahead, Said.\n\n*QUESTION:* Yeah, very quickly - I mean, we have witnessed before - I'm old enough to remember the Reagan campaign, and they actually did influence the hostage negotiations and so on, and they delayed it. I mean, there are examples in history where actually this happened, where certain contenders do not believe that we have one president at a time. I think it's a situation that is probably kind of critical for you guys to deal with in this particular case.\n\n*MR MILLER:* Look, I'm not going to speak to a meeting between the former president and the prime minister. But as I said, we would hope that no American citizen of any party would do anything to jeopardize the work to bring home American hostages who have now been held in captivity for over nine months.\n\nGo ahead.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you.\n\n*QUESTION:* On the topic of presidents, with President Biden being done in six months, does the administration - there by extension the State Department, Antony Blinken - are they at risk of losing any leverage of ending the war in Gaza or in freeing the hostages?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So the President is the President and brings in his conversations the full weight and authority and credibility and influence of the United States, and that has not changed and that is not going to change as long as he's President. And the same goes for the Secretary of State. And so when we have conversations with foreign governments, we always make clear our position and the things that we are willing to do to stand by our position, and that will be the case.\n\n*QUESTION:* If I may - if you'll indulge me, please, on Nicaragua. I know it's totally separate, but can I --\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah.\n\n*QUESTION:* Okay, thank you. Religious freedom in Nicaragua - a couple questions. USCIRF - you're - I'm sure you're familiar with it - the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, they say religious freedom conditions in Nicaragua are getting worse, deteriorating. In fact, USCIRF is holding a virtual hearing tomorrow to discuss the situation in Nicaragua, religious freedom. First question: Will the State Department be in attendance at that virtual meeting?\n\n*MR MILLER:* I don't know the answer to that. I'm happy to check and get back to you.\n\n*QUESTION:* Two: U.S. - USCIRF said recently, quote, \"Nicaragua's government continues to repress the Catholic Church for its human rights advocacy by arbitrarily arresting, imprisoning, and exiling clergy and laypeople and shuttering and seizing the property of Catholic charitable and educational organizations.\" In fact, just recently Ortega shut down Radio Mar\u00eda Nicaragua. That all said, what more can the U.S. do right now, this moment, to help those in Nicaragua being persecuted for their faith?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So you have seen us on a number of occasions speak out about the persecution of religious figures in Nicaragua and call for the release of religious figures, and we will continue to do that.\n\n*QUESTION:* But do you see - is Ortega listening?\n\n*MR MILLER:* I will say that it's not just something that we speak out on but that we work with our partners in the region to accomplish. It is a high priority for us, the exercise of freedom of religion both in Nicaragua and all around the world.\n\n*QUESTION: *Thank you.\n\n*MR MILLER: *Yeah.\n\n*QUESTION: *Thank you, Matt. Today Secretary Blinken met with the Yezidi society leaders here at the State Department. And the Yezidi communities, since 10 years ago when they faced the genocide, they never been so vulnerable as they are now. Unable to go back to their homes and also they are living in a dire situation in IDP camps in the Kurdistan region. The so-called Shingal Agreement has not and no longer being implemented. What's the U.S. firm position on the Yezidi situation in the region and also the Shingal Agreement? Do you still have the faith in that agreement?\n\n*MR MILLER: *So we do believe that the Sinjar Agreement was an important start for supporting those targeted in the 2014 genocide committed by ISIS. But as you note, the agreement has not yet been fully implemented, which must be done in partnership with local communities, including the Yezidis. We continue to encourage the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government to implement the tenants of the Sinjar Agreement, including security, governance, and reconstruction in Sinjar. The upcoming 10th anniversary of the ISIS genocide represents an important moment to demonstrate meaningful progress, and that's what the Secretary discussed with those with whom he met today.\n\n*QUESTION: *And I think you know that the Shingal is a disputed area between two governments, Erbil and Baghdad, and there are several militia groups have control over the area. And this has - political infighting has prevented the reconstruction of the city. So what the role - what roles the U.S. can play in bringing this situation to an end and also give a relief to the Yezidi communities?\n\n*MR MILLER: *So for - protection for vulnerable ethnic and religious communities in Iraq has always been a priority for the State Department. Since 2018 the United States has provided over $500 million in assistance to religious and ethnic minority communities that were targeted for genocide. We provide a significant amount of U.S. humanitarian assistance on the basis of need regardless of ethnic or religious affiliation in addition, and we continue to advocate for the security of Sinjar to be in the hands of federal police and Iraqi Security Forces, including the local police force established under the Sinjar Agreement.\n\nYeah.\n\n*QUESTION: *Thank you, sir. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is here, and there is a big protest planned for tomorrow outside the Capitol Hill. At the same time --\n\n*MR MILLER: *Outside which building?\n\n*QUESTION: *Hill.\n\n*MR MILLER: *The State Department?\n\n*QUESTION: *Yeah - Hill, not the State Department.\n\n*MR MILLER: *Oh, the Hill. Oh, I didn't - the Hill, yeah.\n\n*QUESTION: *Yeah. Yeah. At the same time, there are large groups expected in favor of Netanyahu also. The local media reports that there is a possibility of clash and disturbance on the streets of D.C. tomorrow. What are your thoughts on that? What is your message to the protesters coming here from different states?\n\n*MR MILLER: *So look, we - as you hear us say when we talk about protests around the world - and typically we from the State Department don't talk about domestic matters; there are other agencies inside the U.S. Government that do so - but of course we think all protests should be held peacefully. We support the right of Americans to protest. It's one of the things that makes America great and strengthens our democracy, and so - is people speaking their minds either to the United States Government - to United States Government officials or to foreign government officials who are in town. We support people's right to do that. But of course those protests in any event should remain peaceful.\n\n*QUESTION: *The Pakistani Government was deporting millions of Afghan refugees, but on the intervention of UN and United States, Pakistani Government extended their stay for one more year. What are your thoughts on this decision, and what is your - what is your comment on the situation of Afghan refugees in Pakistan?\n\n*MR MILLER: *Let me take that back and get you an answer.\n\n*QUESTION: *Sir, one last question, if I may.\n\n*MR MILLER: *Yeah.\n\n*QUESTION: *Sir, Pakistani - on the direction of Pakistani Government, the police raided the offices of a political party and arrested the spokesperson. They're also trying to ban this political party. You spoke about it last week, but what is your reaction on the raids on the offices of the political party and arrest of their spokesperson?\n\n*MR MILLER: *So we have seen the reports of the arrests of PTI leaders. We are always concerned when we see arrests of opposition leaders. I'm always personally concerned when I see the arrest of a spokesperson. (Laughter.) We support the peaceful upholding of constitutional and democratic principles, including the rule of law, equal justice under the law, and respect for human rights like freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly. And we urge that these principles be respected in accordance with Pakistan's constitution and laws.\n\nGo ahead - yeah.\n\n*QUESTION: *Thank you, Mr. Matt. Thank you, everyone, and good afternoon. (Inaudible) who are sitting here. My name is Niranira (ph). I'm from Bangladesh and I'm proud Bangladeshi American living in this country last 24 years. I live in New York. I come here to talk one thing. The running president in my country, what he is doing, the way we speak every time, thousand of students are killing, and especially women students - they got raped, killed under that prime minister we call illegal, which is true. He is illegal, unelected Prime Minister Hasina Sheikh - what he is doing in my country right now. Is my concern - I know that concern of USA and always we believe is superpower, and I living in this country, and my - what I say, what I can help from you for my country, Bangladesh. (Inaudible) see my country Bangladesh slide and everything is (inaudible). Thank you.\n\n*MR MILLER: *So we continue to closely follow developments in Bangladesh and call for calm and de-escalation. And as I said yesterday, we condemn any acts of violence, whether they be acts of violence committed against peaceful protesters or they be acts of violence committed by people who are protesting the actions of the government. We support peaceful assembly. We support peaceful protests. But in all cases, they ought to be carried out peacefully, and the government should refrain from acts of violence against peaceful protesters.\n\nBut I would say that when it comes to Bangladesh, we also remain deeply concerned by reports of ongoing telecommunications disruptions across the country which limit the ability of people in Bangladesh, including American citizens there, to access critical information. That's something we have spoken out against in other countries, and we speak out against it when it comes to Bangladesh as well, and we'll continue to make those concerns known.\n\n*QUESTION:* A follow-up on Bangladesh if I may.\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah.\n\n*QUESTION:* Yesterday I informed you that there is thousands of people are getting killed under the direction of Hasina Sheikh, the legal prime minister of Bangladesh. Last night I learned the tank and vehicle with the logo of United Nations are being used and they are firing from those UN carrying a logo vehicle and killing innocent student. Also there is a helicopter on the sky; they're also killing innocent civilians. It's like country is going into a civil war, number one.\n\nAnd number two, some public figure name Nurul Haq, the president of Gono Odhikar Parishad, and there is another leader Tarique Rahma, then another leader Zonayed Saki, then another leader Abu Adnan Taha - everyone is getting kidnapped by the government forces and they are taking advantage because there is no internet, there is no telephone communication, and prime minister is sitting down at Ganabhaban and directing police, army, RAB, and other law enforcement agencies just keep killing because world cannot watch what is going on. I know Europe satellite and American satellite cannot take the picture because there is no internet.\n\nAnd I have third question if you allow me. America is the proponent of democracy and institution of democracy in all over the world. We respect that. But under the direction of General Asim Munir of Pakistan and the chief justice of Faez Isa, they are destroying every single democratic institution in Pakistan. There is no reflection of the people's choice in Pakistan. Do you think America other than showing concern and expect something, do you think that country is on the right direction?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So I think that the - what we as the United States have always done - and I should say what we have always done when we are at our best - is to speak out for democratic values around the world and make sure that - or - and make clear that countries are strongest when they uphold democratic values - countries anywhere in the world. And that's what we're going to continue to do. That's our greatest strength, and it's what will continue to guide our approach.\n\nDo you have another one?\n\n*QUESTION:* Do you think Hasina Sheikh and the operatives in Pakistan, they are listening what American, European governments are asking them to do?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So we will continue to make our priorities clear. We will continue to make our values clear. Does every country in the United - or in the world do exactly what the United States or any country in Europe or any other country around the world thinks they ought to do or thinks how they ought to handle every situation? Of course not. Sovereign countries make their own decisions. They always have. They always will.\n\nWhat we can do is impress upon countries what we believe are the right way to approach questions of fundamental freedom, questions of democratic values, questions of human rights, and bring all the influence we can to bear to urge them along that path. And that's what we'll continue to do.\n\n*QUESTION:* But would you like to make a comment that they're using United Nations logo on the Humvees and tank and they are firing from that vehicle into the civilian and thousands of people are getting killed? Why they are using United Nations logo?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So I am not aware of that specific report. You should address that to the United Nations, I would think. But I would say, as I have made clear, we condemn any violence against peaceful protests. Protesters should be allowed to carry out their fundamental freedom of expression, their fundamental freedom of speech. And at the same time, we urge that all protests be peaceful.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you.\n\n*MR MILLER:* Yeah.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you, Matt. I'll be on a different topic. How would you describe Secretary Blinken's relationship with Vice President Harris?\n\n*MR MILLER:* He has an extremely close working relationship with the Vice President. He's actually known her for more than 10 years, worked with her before she became Vice President, before he became Secretary of State. He spoke to some of this this morning when he talked about how he's seen her inside the Oval Office, inside the Situation Room and overseas asking tough questions about difficult issues and really getting to the heart of some of the difficult foreign policy choices that we face, and that he has been impressed by her both command of various foreign policy issues, but just as importantly her insights into getting at what really can be the nub of an issue and try to determine how we as a nation can move forward in a way that serves the American people.\n\n*QUESTION:* And would he be interested in continuing to serve under a potential Harris administration?\n\n*MR MILLER:* Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. There's an election that's going to take place. I'm not going to comment on the election. I think we should take things one day at a time.\n\nYeah.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you. I don't claim to be an expert on this, but there's a British musician called Charli who has described Kamala Harris as \"brat.\" (Laughter.) She did give an interview to the BBC saying - explaining what that term means. She said she feels like - talking about Kamala here - \"feels like herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it's brat. You're brat. That's brat.\" I just wondered if you had any comment on that as the possible future of the president, or if that affects foreign policy at all.\n\n*MR MILLER:* My comment is I think - I think I am officially aged out of participating in this conversation. (Laughter.) And I'm trying to think of anything I could say that wouldn't make me look worse for having - saying it, and I'm coming up with nothing. So I think some things are better left to a younger generation to comment on, and I'm certainly not that.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you.\n\n*QUESTION:* Thank you so very much. I'm not sure if someone already asked about this, but it's about the U.S. troops withdrawal from the Iraq, as number of media reports suggest that Iraqi officials, Iraqi Government, they want complete withdrawal of U.S. forces. And we have seen months before U.S. hosted top Iraqi official regarding this. So the question is with this intense and panicked situation in the Middle East, the U.S. is ready to do for the base, and there is specific quantities, specific numbers, U.S. are to keep their - this withdrawal process.\n\n*MR MILLER:* So I would refer you to the Department of Defense to comment on that in detail. But as we have said before, we are committed to the Higher Military Commission, which is a process that is taking place in Baghdad to determine how and when the coalition's military mission will transition. And we've spoken this before - to this before, and nothing has changed.\n\n*QUESTION:* Secondly, the Pakistani recent military spokesperson highlighted three things I asked before and my senior colleague, Mr. Afridi, asked many times, that is regarding the digital terrorism that Pakistani military spokesperson is mentioning again and again. And that is - that is all about the - all those vocals who are supporting Imran Khan and his party and everything and all that. Secondly, he highlighted the number of operations Pakistani military is doing all day in 24 hours. That is between hundreds - 60 to 80 operations he mentioned.\n\nSo there are two questions. So I already asked before that the (inaudible) Pakistani Government (inaudible) to curtail media freedoms, social media freedom. And secondly, the Pakistani officials - the security officials, they are again hinting more U.S. military assistance or something like that. So you have anything on that?\n\n*MR MILLER:* So with respect to the first question, as I've spoken to with respect to other countries, we support media freedom in Pakistan, just as we support it around the world. And with the second, I don't have any announcements to make today.\n\nWith that, I think we'll wrap for today. Thanks, everyone.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 2:09 p.m.)\n\nTags\n\nBangladesh [ https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/bangladesh/ ] China [ https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/china/ ] Iran [

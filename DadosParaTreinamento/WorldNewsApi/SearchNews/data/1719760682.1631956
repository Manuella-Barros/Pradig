Luckily, there are far cheaper and easier options to refresh your sleeping quarters that takes virtually no effort and almost no time at all. One of those ways is through updating your main duvet set.. A new bed spread can elevate your bedroom or guest rooms by injecting a bit of colour and texture into your space, as the bed is more often than not the main focus of the room. There are so many great duvet covers at a range of different price points on the market, but there is one set in particular that shoppers are raving about at Dunelm. Shoppers have been snapping up the Maria Ochre Reversible Floral Duvet Cover and Pillowcase Set in droves while it is discounted heavily in Dunelm's massive summer sale. For a limited time, shoppers can pick up the gorgeous white and floral bed spread for as little as \u00a37 for a single, \u00a310 for a double, \u00a312 for a kingsize and \u00a315 for a kingsize.

Its reversible design offers two looks in one, with an alternate detailed patterning. Crafted from a soft polycotton blend, Maria is durable with easycare properties, providing ultimate comfort for the best night's sleep.\" The Maria Ochre Reversible Floral Duvet Cover and Pillowcase Set has racked up a near-perfect average review rating of 4.8 stars out of five from over 250 reviews. One shopper said: \"A great buy. Looks more expensive than what I paid, really good value, suits my bedroom style perfectly.\" A second wrote: \"Nice quality duvet set with a fresh look and reasonably priced. Love the colours bought to match feature wall of grey and yellow wallpaper.\" A third penned: \"Love this bedding. Good quality and feels lovely and cosy. My bedroom looks bright and beautiful.\" \"This is a gorgeous bedding set,\" mentioned another. \"We use it in our holiday let and it's a doddle to iron. The beds always look beautiful. We also run a B&B with Dunelm bedding in all the rooms, and this particular set is the best of all we've tried - so much so that we're now replacing all bedding with this one.\" However, one person gave the Maria Ochre Reversible Floral Duvet Cover and Pillowcase Set a three-star review because Dunelm doesn't sell extra pillowcases to go with the set. They wrote: \"It\u2019s a lovely bed set but the only additional pillow cases you sell to match this are Oxford pillow cases. I really want an additional two standard pillow cases and would have to purchase an entire other bedding set to get them.\" But another loved their latest Dunelm purchase, adding: \"lovely quality and fits perfectly. The sunny looking material brightens up the room. As its reversible you get 'two for one'. It's a winner every time.\" Or shoppers can pick up the Pure Cotton Floral Bedding Set, which starts from \u00a329.50, from Marks and Spencer. Or slightly more expensive is the Pure Cotton Sateen Aspden Bedding Set from Laura Ashley that starts from \u00a350.", "summary": "&quot;A great buy.

With the female welterweight boxer set to compete for a gold medal on Friday, it once again offers the chance for misinformation surrounding the debacle to come to light.\n\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif, along with Taipei's Lin Yu-ting, remains the loudest talking point of the Summer Games. The pair of boxers have been in the spotlight after it was revealed that the two were banned from the 2023 World Championships due to failed gender eligibility tests administered by the International Boxing Association (IBA).\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has supported the boxers' participation in the 2024 Paris Games, hence why the two remain in the competition. Both the IOC and IBA have given their sides of the debate, however, the complete details of the situation remain murky.\n\nWith that said, here is what we know about the facts of the Khelif case and the ongoing conversation that has followed.\n\nDeCOURCY: Imane Khelif's current opponent is bigger than her sport\n\nIn most cases. if an individual is revealed to have XY chromosomes, they would fall under the male gender. However, there are exceptions, as there are certain conditions that can allow a woman to present XY chromosomes.\n\nDSD stands for differences in sexual development. They are a group of conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nSome people with DSDs that are raised as female may have sex chromosomes other than XX, or potentially also elevated testosterone levels, according to NIH.\n\nIt is not true that athletes with variations in their sex traits, or DSDs, are the same as transgender athletes. Conflating the two is considered to be inaccurate.\n\nIt is not verified that Khelif has a variation in sex traits or DSDs, according to GLAAD and interACT.\n\nSwyer syndrome is a rare genetic condition in which an individual has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell (typically found in males), but they have female reproductive structures, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nIt is not verified if Khelif has been diagnosed with Swyer syndrome.\n\nKhelif is a woman, according to GLAAD and interACT. She is not transgender, and does not identify as intersex. She has competed as a woman in boxing for years.\n\nKhelif was one of two boxers to fail a gender eligibility test ahead of the 2023 World Boxing Championships. Those competitions are sanctioned by the IBA, and it was the same group that administered the tests.\n\nThe IBA said that these tests revealed that Khelif has XY chromosomes, which are most commonly found in males. This is what started the controversy in the first place.\n\nThe group previously stated that \"the athletes did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential.\" But IBA president Umar Kremlev contradicted that statement at a press conference during the Olympics.\n\n\"We got the test results that they allowed us to take themselves and these tests show they have a high level of testosterone like a man,\" Kremlev said through a translator. \"Man's level of testosterone.\"\n\nDeCOURCY: IBA's ugly press conference further imperils boxing's Olympic future\n\nThe IOC defended Khelif's eligibility amid the controversy, releasing a statement before the Olympics that said \"every person has the right to practice sport without discrimination.\"\n\n\"The two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA,\" the IOC said, arguing that Khelif and Yu-Ting \"were suddenly disqualified without any due process.\"\n\n\"The Algerian boxer was born female, was registered female, lived her life as a female, boxed as a female, has a female passport,\" IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said during a media briefing. \"This is not a transgender case.\"\n\nThe organization does not use the gender eligibility tests that the IBA utilize. Instead, the IOC went back to using passports to determine age and gender, which were the previous regulations used at prior Olympics.\n\n\"Many women can have testosterone which will be called 'male levels' and still be women and still compete as women,\" IOC spokesman Adams said. \"This idea that you do one test for testosterone and that sorts everything out? Not the case I'm afraid.\"\n\nThere is well-documented bad blood between the two organizations. The IOC banned the IBA from the Olympics in 2023, causing the ongoing dispute between the two groups. Considering the IOC doesn't currently recognize the IBA, it does not come as a surprise that the result of the IBA's tests and the bans that followed were not held up by the IOC.\n\n\"The IOC has made it clear that it needs National Boxing Federations to reach a consensus around a new International Federation,\" the IOC said in its statement.\n\nThe IOC also has threatened to remove boxing from the 2028 Olympics altogether if no changes are made to the process of sanctioning fights.\n\nUltimately, Khelif checked the boxes that are required in order to compete in the 2024 Olympics. While she may have been disqualified from the World Championships sanctioned by the IBA, those standards do not apply to the IOC and the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "XY sex-determination system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_gonadal_dysgenesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "XY gonadal dysgenesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterACT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "InterACT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GLAAD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_people_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender people in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex chromosome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Y chromosome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Cancer Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex organ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Intersexed", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Intersexed", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Family_and_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Family and Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/Imane%20Khelif%20080724.jpg?itok=Dn91Pk1x", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803238", "eventUri": "eng-9803238", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The following day, Lin defeated Uzbekistan's Sitora Turdibekova in the featherweight division by unanimous decision - allowing the Taiwanese to advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nThe two fighters have been under fire in the past few days over their gender identity. Both had been disqualified at the 2023 World Championships organized by the International Boxing Association (IBA). Lin and Khelif reportedly failed the IBA's eligibility rules, which bar athletes with male XY chromosomes from participating in women's events. (Related: World Athletics bans transgender athletes from competing in female category at international events.)\n\n\"The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision,\" the IOC said in a statement. \"The IOC is saddened by the abuse that the two athletes are currently receiving. Every person has the right to practice sport without discrimination.\"\n\nBut from the looks of things, Carini is more justified to be called a victim of aggression. During the Aug. 1 competition, Khelif delivered two powerful punches to the head that hurt the Italian despite the presence of protective gear.\n\nAccording to Carini, the punches from Khelif \"hurt too much,\" adding that she has never been hit so hard. Following the 46-second bout, the Italian boxer could be heard in the ring telling her coach that \"it's not right.\"\n\nThe IOC, which categorizes boxers as men or women based on their passport, pointed its finger at the IBA for the vitriol being received by Khelif and Lin. According to Reuters, the IBA was stripped of its recognition by the IOC last year over governance and finance issues - leading to the IOC running the boxing events in France.\n\n\"These two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA. Toward the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process. According to the IBA minutes available on their website, this decision was initially taken solely by the IBA Secretary General and CEO [Chris Roberts],\" said the IOC.\n\n\"The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision which was taken without any proper procedure - especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years.\"\n\nAccording to the IOC, the rules of eligibility were based on those of the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021 and cannot be changed during a match.\n\nMeanwhile, the IBA criticized \"inconsistencies in eligibility\" at the Paris Olympics in a statement. It also defended the decision to exclude Khelif and Lin, arguing that the two fell short of the association's eligibility requirements.\n\n\"Both Khelif and Lin post-testing did not meet the required eligibility criteria to compete within the female category of our respective events,\" the IBA stated. \"The urgent nature of the decision [to disqualify the boxers] was justified, as the safety of our boxers is our top priority.\"\n\nWatch John O'Looney's commentary about Algeria's Imane Khelif beating Italy's Angela Carini in the 2024 Paris Olympics below.cult\n\nMen pretending to be \"women\"

In June 2023, the IOC voted unanimously (69-1 with ten members abstaining) to remove the IBA as the governing body for Olympic boxing, a decision which was later upheld in court.\n\n\"We highly value the sport of boxing. We have an extremely serious problem with IBA because of their governance,\" IOC President Thomas Bach told members during an online meeting via the Associated Press.\n\n\"The boxers fully deserve to be governed by an international federation with integrity and transparency.\"\n\nWhat caused this relationship to break down? Why is the IOC questioning the \"integrity and transparency\" of an organization that governed Olympic boxing for years? And what is the IBA's current role in amateur boxing?\n\nThe Sporting News takes a deep dive into the origins of the IBA and its current standing in the sport.\n\nMORE: Fact-checking the Imane Khelif Olympic boxing controversy\n\nThe roots of the IBA can be traced back to 1946 when the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Boxe Amateur (FIBA) was dissolved in favor of fledgling competitor AIBA (Association Internationale de Boxe Amateur (AIBA).\n\nFor over six decades, the AIBA has controlled Olympic boxing competitions. In 2007, as part of a reform, the name of the company was changed to the International Boxing Association.\n\nThe IBA currently governs the IBA World Boxing Championships and the Youth and Junior World Boxing Championships. They no longer govern boxing at the Olympic Games.\n\nMORE: Boxers who went from Olympic gold to professional gold\n\nIn 2020, Russian sports magnet Umar Kremlev was elected President of the IBA. Operations were moved from Switzerland to Russia, with the latter country's energy giant Gazprom becoming the sole sponsor of the organization.\n\nWhen it emerged that IBA debts of over $20 million were suddenly cleared, the IOC strongly opposed Gazprom's association. It was also widely reported that Kremlev has connections to Vladimir Putin, supported by the fact that Ukraine was suspended by the IBA following the Russian invasion in 2022.\n\nThese publicized events led to the complete breakdown of the relationship between the IBA and the IOC. The latter has already taken control of the boxing competition at Tokyo 2020 and officially removed the IBA from governance in the summer of 2023.\n\nThe IOC has also governed boxing at Paris 2024 but would like a new independent organisation to step in for Los Angeles 2028.\n\nMORE: Who is Imane Khelif? Bio and history of Algerian Olympic boxer\n\nDespite reaching the finals of the IBA-governed World Championships in March 2023, Khelif and Lin were disqualified before their respective bouts for \"medical reasons.\"\n\nIn the weeks that followed, it emerged that Algeria's Khelif and Taiwan's Lin were removed from the competition due to failed gender identity tests.\n\nKremlev would state that these results proved that Khelif and Lin carried male chromosomes, which gave the athletes an unfair advantage in female competition.\n\nHowever, details of the testing procedures and specifics on the results have never been released, with the IBA stating that the findings are confidential.\n\nThe IOC does not recognize independent drug testing. Instead, they accept gender identity details from the corresponding National Olympic Committees and gender information provided on passports.\n\nIt has been widely reported that Khelif and Lin were both born females. It has also been speculated that these women have a condition known as DSD (Differences in Sexual Development).\n\nOn Monday, the IBA held a press conference in Paris to explain their position, only to use the time they had as an opportunity to besmirch the IOC. The event turned into a farce.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Khelif was disqualified from last year's Women's World Boxing Championships after the IBA said she failed a DNA test.\n\nThe IBA confirmed Khelif was also tested at the previous year's World Championships, adding she had not undergone \"a testosterone examination\" but was \"subject to a separate and recognised test, whereby the specifics remain confidential\".\n\nLike Khelif, Taiwan's Lin was disqualified from last year's World Championships as a result of similar tests conducted there and the previous year.\n\nShe was stripped of a bronze medal won at last year's event. She had won gold the previous year, to add to a bantamweight title she had claimed in 2018.\n\nThese tests, however, are not recognised by the Olympics, who instead accept national Olympic body approval so long as their passports correspond.\n\nKhelif had initially lodged an appeal against her disqualification with the Court of Arbitration for Sport only to withdraw it. The IOC, meanwhile, has already stated \"this is not a transgender issue\" and pointed out she also competed at the last Olympics in Tokyo, but it has provided no further clarity as to Khelif's status.\n\nIt is most likely the fighters were born with differences in sex development (DSD), akin to middle-distance runner Caster Semenya. The extent of any such differences can vary but those with DSD assigned as female at birth often possess internal testes that produce testosterone, giving them a potential size and strength advantage over those without them.\n\nWhat sex chromosomes do Khelif and Lin have?\n\nIf the IBA tests are taken at face value, XY chromosomes are present in the DNA of both fighters, although the IOC disputes the eligibility of the tests.\n\nAfter Khelif's diqualification from the WWBC, IBA president Umar Kremlev told Russian news agency TASS it was due to results from DNA tests of certain fighters.\n\nHe added: \"Based on the results of the tests, it was proven that they have XY [male] chromosomes. Such athletes were excluded from the competition.\"\n\nWere Khelif or Lin ever male?\n\nNo. Not according to the IOC, which has said both Khelif and Lin were \"born women and raised women\". However, the IBA insist its test results should bring the eligibility of both for women's boxing into question.\n\nThe IOC has said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female, which is the case for Khelif and Lin.\n\nWhen are Khelif and Lin's Olympic boxing finals?\n\nImane Khelif will go for gold in the 66kg final against Liu Yang of China on Friday, with the bout scheduled for 9.51pm.\n\nLin Yu-Ting will appear at Roland-Garros Stadium the following evening at 8.30pm. She will fight Poland's Julia Szeremeta for Olympic gold in the 57kg category.\n\nWhy are Khelif and Lin allowed to compete at the Olympics?\n\nAfter previously policing gender eligibility at the Games, the IOC has passed the buck to the international federations of individual sports, many of which have now banned transgender women from competing in female events. The likes of athletics also have rules in place governing those with DSD, which are enforced at the Olympics.\n\nSo, under normal circumstances, you would expect the IOC to follow the IBA's lead when it comes to eligibility. However, the IBA has not run the Olympic boxing competition since 2016 following a major corruption scandal, with the IOC instead taking charge.\n\nThat has seen it use arguably out-of-date gender-eligibility rules at the Games, prompting major criticism from women's rights campaigners. The fact it is effectively at war with the IBA and that a rival international federation, World Boxing, could end up running the sport at the Olympics in future has also not helped when it comes to alignment between the two bodies.\n\nIt is also unclear why Khelif was disqualified by the IBA only before her gold-medal match at last year's World Championships given she had been tested a year earlier, when she won silver.\n\nHow likely are Khelif and Lin to win?\n\nBoth fighters are heavy favourites, Khelif more so than Lin. Many leading bookmakers have even halted betting on the Algerian's category, signalling how strongly tipped she has become.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIt will be interesting to see if further abandonments, or even boycotts, follow. Sharron Davies, the British swimming icon turned women's rights campaigner, told Telegraph Sport: \"Boxing countries need to come together and say, 'Enough!', to protect female boxers and the integrity of the sport.\"\n\nAny legal challenge to the IOC regulations would likely have to be lodged with a civil court by an affected athlete and would be potentially very expensive.", "source":

The Room of Mirrors. No, it was not a joke.\n\nThe IBA wished to urgently give a \"detailed explanation of the reasons for the disqualification of two boxers, Imane Khelif from Algeria and Lin Yu-ting from Taiwan, from all IBA competitions\". In the middle of the Olympic Games?\n\nAn interesting coincidence here was Khelif was disqualified from the New Delhi World Championships in 2023 three days after she won an early-round bout against Azalia Amineva, a previously unbeaten Russian prospect.\n\nAs the Paris press conference progressed, it descended into a chaotic and shambolic event. Sky: \"Boxing press conference was a sideshow that turned into a shambles.\" Time Magazine: \"The IBA held a press conference about boxing's gender controversy. It was a chaotic mess.\" But first some background.\n\nThe IBA is led by a Russian, whose current name is Umar Kremlev. His original name was Umar Lutfuloev. He and the IBA have a deal in place with Gazprom, who have been generously supplying sponsorship and prize money to boxing. Gazprom is an enormous Russian majority state-owned energy company.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not recognise the IBA because of major concerns stated in a letter last year regarding the IBA's \"practice and activities\".\n\nThe IOC asked for boxing to make reforms on governance, finance and ethical issues but nothing was forthcoming that satisfied the IOC requests. Now, not only is the IBA outside the IOC tent, but boxing has been left off the roster for the LA Games in four years' time.\n\nThe organisation's history is also opaque. In 2021, it was announced that the boxing federation had paid in full an outstanding $10 million debt to Azerbaijani company Benkons LLC. In the same announcement, we were informed of a $7 million round of development funding to national federations. The IOC wanted details but didn't get them.\n\nBefore that the organisation elected Uzbek businessman Gafur Rakhimov as president. At the time he was on a US Treasury Department sanctions list for alleged links to international heroin trafficking, the same list to which Daniel Kinahan was added in 2022.\n\nThe dispute has been simmering for some time, with the IOC running the boxing events at Tokyo and Paris without input from the IBA.\n\nSo, the IBA held their press conference in the room of mirrors. Throughout the event technical glitches and noise disrupted Kremlev, who did not attend in person. He brought zero clarity and stoked fresh doubts over gender eligibility. He also referred to the opening ceremony and hitched himself to the offended Christians wagon.\n\nA report on Sky also cited Chris Roberts, the IBA chief executive. Roberts was also opaque and couldn't expand on the principal issue - the nature and results of the tests the IBA allegedly carried out that led to both boxers being banned.\n\n\"We don't have a conspiracy theory,\" said Roberts. \"We're not able to disclose the results of any tests but you can read between the lines of where that sits.\"\n\nWell, no you can't. The IBA didn't achieve clarity, they achieved what they wanted to and that was bedlam by successfully dragging the eligibility dispute into a wider war over gender identity.\n\n\"The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure, especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years,\" the IOC said in a statement. Correct. Harrington beat Khelif on her way to an Olympic gold medal in Tokyo three years ago. There was no issue at the time.\n\n\"Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process,\" added the statement.\n\nThe issue is triggering for many people across all sports. There is a need to sort out equitably who can and cannot take part in women's competitions.\n\nBut the IBA intervention was not about fairness or safety or about caring for some of their women boxers. It was a surge of aggression in an increasingly dirty turf war between them and the IOC.\n\n[ IBA gender tests on boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting flawed and illegitimate, says IOCOpens in new window ]\n\nThe two athletes have been the collateral damage as the IBA despicably refuse to disclose evidence. Instead, the pair have been attacked by the organisation who are supposed to represent them and who are required to show them a duty of care. The press conference and the bans were political strokes by an association desperate to hold position and relevance within the Olympic family.\n\nAdditionally, they have campaigned to ensnare both Khelif and Yu-ting in a poisonous dispute, the result of which has been to place them at the centre of a culture war that all week has been characterised by ignorance, cruelty and a lack of humanity.\n\nTactically, the IBA's apparent belief that a deliberate assault on two individuals protected by the Olympic Charter, and the disruption of boxing at the Olympics, can get them back to the table seems naive, and desperate. And the chances of having boxing as part of the roster for Los Angeles 2028 look doomed.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [],

We were also told that these kinds of tests are and can be against human rights because they are too intrusive. Then the new system was developed in great agreement with everybody. And I think this is since 1999 or 2000 that this system has been working. Therefore, our decision is very clear. Women must be allowed to take part in women's-competitions,\" said Bach.\n\nKhalif will be competing for a gold medal in the final of the women's 66 kg boxing at the ongoing Paris Olympics.\n\nKhalif, who was banned from competing in world championships following failures in testosterone and gender eligibility tests, achieved a controversial win over Italy's Angela Carini within just 46 seconds after her opponent quit in the opening round.\n\nNow in the semifinals, she defeated Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand by 5-0, via win by points.\n\nImane will be battling China's Yang Liu for the top prize on August 10.\n\nThe win over Carini drew adverse comments from many prominent people like JK Rowling and Elon Musk who took to social media questioning the gender of Khelif.\n\nJust before her gold medal bout in the International Boxing Association (IBA) Women's Championships held in New Delhi last year, Khelif was disqualified as she had failed to meet IBA's eligibility criteria. She was not allowed to compete due to elevated testosterone levels, as per ESPN.\n\nBut she was allowed to compete in the Paris Olympics by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) task force, which is running past two Olympic boxing events as IBA has been banned from the past two years from the Olympics due to governance issues, lack of financial transparency and instances of corruption in judging and refereeing.\n\nIOC defended the rights of Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, another boxer under scrutiny due to failing an unspecified eligibility requirement in a biochemical test, to compete in the Olympics.\n\nReplying to the controversy, the IOC said on Thursday in a statement, \"All athletes participating in the boxing tournament of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations set by the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU). As with previous Olympic boxing competitions, the gender and age of the athletes are based on their passports.\"\n\n\"These rules also applied during the qualification period, including the boxing tournaments of the 2023 European Games, Asian Games, Pan American Games and Pacific Games, the ad hoc 2023 African qualifying tournament in Dakar (SEN) and two world qualifying tournaments held in Busto Arsizio (ITA) and Bangkok (THA) in 2024, which involved a total of 1,471 different boxers from 172 National Olympic Committees (NOCs), the Boxing Refugee Team and Individual Neutral Athletes, and featured over 2,000 qualification bouts,\" the IOC statement read.\n\nThe IOC said that the athletes in question had been subjects of an arbitrary decision by the International Boxing Association earlier.\n\n\"We have seen in reports misleading information about two female athletes competing at the Olympic Games Paris 2024. The two athletes have been competing in international boxing competitions for many years in the women's category, including the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, International Boxing Association (IBA) World Championships and IBA-sanctioned tournaments. These two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA. Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process,\" the IOC said.\n\n\"According to the IBA minutes available on their website, this decision was initially taken solely by the IBA Secretary General and CEO. The IBA Board only ratified it afterwards and only subsequently requested that a procedure to follow in similar cases in the future be established and reflected in the IBA regulations. The minutes also say that the IBA should \"establish a clear procedure on gender testing. The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure - especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years. Such an approach is contrary to good governance,\" the IOC added.\n\nThe IOC said it was committed to protecting the human rights of all athletes participating in the Olympic Games as per the Olympic Charter, the IOC Code of Ethics and the IOC Strategic Framework on Human Rights. The IOC further said it was saddened by the abuse that the two athletes are currently receiving, the release added.

She went to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 as one of Algeria's first Olympic boxers and while she won her opening bout, she lost her second.\n\nKhelif has had some previous international success but she has been beaten by nine women boxers prior to the Paris games.\n\nBoxing's questionable approach to gender testing\n\nIn 2023, a boxing competition held in Russia and run by the International Boxing Association (IBA) questioned the gender identity of Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-Ting (who is also competing at the Paris Olympics).\n\nThe IBA president, Umar Kremlev of Russia, was quoted as saying the two athletes had XY chromosomes and thus were subsequently disqualified.\n\nElsewhere, it was stated the athletes presented with \"elevated\" levels of testosterone.\n\nThe facts are yet to be confirmed and it is not the role of an international sports organization to be handing out personal and private information.\n\nUpon request from the athletes, the IBA refused to provide evidence of the tests undertaken.\n\nThe IBA minutes (available on its website) state the decision to disqualify Khelif and Lin was initially taken solely by the IBA secretary general and CEO.\n\nThe IBA board only ratified it afterwards, with the minutes stating the organization needs to \"establish a clear procedure on gender testing\".\n\nAs the records suggest, the IBA did not follow ethical practice regarding the disqualification of Khelif and Yu-Ting. In fact, the very use of such tests to identify an athlete's sex and/or gender are highly problematic.\n\nSex testing in question\n\nSince 1968, some sportswomen competing in the Olympics have had to undergo humiliating tests \"proving\" their gender identities. This often involved visual examinations of their genitals in front of doctors and other medical experts.\n\nMandated by the IOC, \"gender verification\" tests were then implemented by international sports organizations.\n\nUnderpinning such practices was a set of problematic assumptions, particularly that a woman who is good at sport could perhaps be a man masquerading as female.\n\nBeyond visual examinations, blood tests documenting hormone levels and/or chromosome testing were used. But as research has revealed, the effects of testosterone on performance are often overstated, and understandings of sporting performance and gender require much more nuanced approaches.\n\nAfter many years of critique, the IOC halted such practices in 1999.\n\nIn place of outdated sex tests that fail to recognise the physiological and socio-psychological complexities of gender identity, the IOC introduced a new set of guidelines prioritising the basic human rights of privacy, inclusion and participation.\n\nWhile the IOC sets out the framework in the hope of guiding other international organizations towards more inclusive understandings of gender, the guidelines remain contested.\n\nSome organizations opted to take alternative approaches to testing and proving an athlete's \"true\" gender identity - for example, World Athletics continue to use testosterone testing.\n\nBoxing and the IOC: a clash of ethics\n\nThe boxing events at the Paris Olympics are not being organized by the IBA, but instead by a special IOC-appointed unit.\n\nThe IBA was suspended in 2019 by the IOC, and last year stripped of its status as the world governing body of amateur boxing due to concerns regarding its governance, financial transparency and integrity of its officials.\n\nThe IOC was also concerned the IBA refused to follow their approach in issuing sanctions on Russian athletes over the Ukraine war.\n\nWith the Russian leadership of the IBA, this position highlights another layer of geopolitical complexity in this case.\n\nResponding to the media frenzy after the Khelif-Carini bout, the Paris 2024 boxing unit stated: \"all athletes participating in the boxing tournament comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations set by the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU)\".\n\nThe IBA has responded by offering Carini and her coach a payment similar to the purse awarded to the Olympic champion (US$100,000).\n\nSince the incident, Carini has apologized to Khelif for her reaction and the resulting abuse, stating she would \"embrace her\" the next time they meet.\n\nThe real issues for women in sport\n\nIn the contemporary context, many sportswomen who appear too powerful, too successful, or look \"too masculine\" according to a particular set of values are at risk of being targeted. Importantly, it is most often non-white athletes who face the most scrutiny of their gendered sporting bodies.\n\nBeyond the ethics of the tests being used, the extreme levels of online abuse directed to sportswomen such as Khelif and Lin reveal new ways in which women's bodies are being policed and regulated.\n\nTo avoid such accusations, many sportswomen are engaging in what scholars have termed \"emphasised femininity\" - wearing long lashes, jewellery, make-up, painted nails and overtly feminine clothing. This is not because it enhances their performance but to reassure audiences (and critics) of their femininity.\n\nIf they do not offer a convincing performance that meets limited versions of femininity, they may also face surveillance of their gendered bodies, and public attack and online abuse.\n\nHowever, this recent controversy may be a distraction from the real issues affecting women's sport, such as safeguarding against systematic abuse, which has been seen in recent high-profile cases involving Volleyball Australia and USA Gymnastics.\n\nWhile the Paris Olympic and Paralympics may be celebrated as the first \"gender equitable\" games, with 50% female participation, the abuse faced by Khelif and Yu-Ting highlight the challenges many women still face in sport.",

On August 1, 2024, a few brisk punches were exchanged between Algerian Imane Khelif and Italian Angela Carini in the women's 66 kg preliminary boxing match. In under a minute, Carini abandoned the match and Khelif emerged as the winner.\n\nAfter the match, Carini told BBC Sport, \"I wasn't able to finish the match. I felt a strong pain in my nose and I said [to myself] for the experience that I have and the maturity as a woman that I have, I said I hope my nation won't take it badly, I hope my dad won't take it badly - but I stopped, I said stop for myself.\"\n\nItaly's Prime minister, Georgia Meloni commented on the matter, as recorded by the Associated Press, saying, \"I think that athletes with male genetic characteristics should not be allowed to compete in women's competitions, and not because one wants to discriminate against anyone but to protect the right of female athletes to be able to compete on equal terms.\"\n\nFurther, on her X account, Meloni added, \"I know you won't give up, Angela, and I know that one day you will earn with effort and sweat what you deserve. In a finally fair competition.\" Her statement garnered several comments - some supporting Carini, others supporting Khelif, and many speculating on Khelif's biological sex.\n\nThe more recent news of the disqualification of Vinesh Phogat for being overweight, by roughly 100 gm, in an altogether different sport of wrestling, has once again sent social media abuzz. Some social media users are attempting to draw parallels between the dramatically different situations by claiming that rules for gender need to be as black-and-white as the rules with regard to weight.\n\nBut the noise on social media has drowned out the facts. Payoshni Mitra, athlete rights advocate and executive director of Humans of Sport said, \"A spectacle [is being made] around mega sporting events. This is particularly done by lobby groups, and federations with an agenda to garner public opinion. But no one cares for the athletes and their well-being.\"\n\nWith a great deal of disinformation and/or misinformation surrounding the issue, here's what we know and what we don't know with regard to gender controversy: The root of the controversy lies in the World Boxing Championships in 2023, held in New Delhi. During the 2023 games, the IBA (International Boxing Association) was the sanctioning body for the sport. During the event, Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting were disqualified by the IBA, claiming the athletes were ineligible.\n\nJust prior to the controversial 2024 match, in Paris, the IBA released a statement saying that the 'disqualification was a result of failure to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition,' as set by the IBA regulations.\n\nThe statement further stated that in 2023 the, 'athletes did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test, whereby the specifics remain confidential', and that Khelif (and Lin) were found to have 'competitive advantages over other female competitors.'\n\nKhelif's 2023 disqualification by the IBA -- a Russian-dominated sports body -- was deemed biased due to its timing. The disqualification came within days of Khelif winning an early-round match against Azalia Amineva, a previously unbeaten Russian. This disqualification meant that the Russian boxer's official record was once again set straight with no losses.\n\nIn response to the IBA's recent statements, the IOC pushed back by stressing that the IBA's recognition itself was withdrawn in 2023, a decision that was upheld by the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sports). The IOC further stated that Imane's disqualification by the IBA was 'a sudden and arbitrary decision', and had taken place 'without due process'.\n\nThe flames were fuelled yet again, post the contentious boxing match, on August 5 2024, when the IBA held a press conference in Paris which multiple news organisations described as 'chaotic'. Here once again the IBA said: \"The results of the chromosome tests demonstrated both boxers were ineligible,\" while admitting that the tests and the results thereof were confidential.\n\nIBA president Umar Kremlev also reportedly said that the tests had shown that both boxers had high levels of testosterone. But the IBA's doctor, Ioannis Filippatos, said testosterone had not been tested for. Moreover, the IBA had also stated on July 31, 2024, that no testosterone test had taken place and had placed reliance upon alleged chromosome tests. The contradictory information has only led to greater speculation and has further reduced the credibility of the IBA.\n\nIn an interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan on August 1, 2024, IBA chief executive Chris Roberts said male XY chromosomes were found in 'both cases'. Roberts said there were 'different strands involved in that' and therefore the body could not commit to referring to the fighters as 'biologically male'.\n\nOn the other hand, IOC has repeatedly stated that, \"As with previous Olympic boxing competitions, the gender and age of the athletes are based on their passport\". In various statements, IOC via representatives, has stated that Khelif (and Yu-ting) are 'born as a woman, raised as a woman, and have passport as a woman. And have competed for many years as a woman. And this is the clear definition of a woman.\"\n\nNo proof in the form of medical test results or laboratory tests has been disclosed by either of the warring factions while stressing the privacy of the athletes.\n\nTo set the record state on gender variations, GLAAD, the world's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) media advocacy organisation, and InterACT, which works to empower intersex youth, have released a fact sheet. The sheet acknowledges that there is no substantiated information on Khelif's sex traits. However, to combat the misinformation on biological sex, the sheet explains that there are variations in sex traits or differences in sexual development (DSDs).\n\nThe NHS (National Health Services in the United Kingdom) also recognises DSD which, simply put, are a group of conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs. Some with DSDs are raised female but may have sex chromosomes other than XX, or elevated testosterone levels.\n\nNadeem Rais, a senior endocrinologist, based in Mumbai, explains that there are many different types of DSDs. He explained: \"A child may be born with female genital appearance, but may also have internal testes in the pelvis, and may carry the XY chromosome\". He said that for those with typical external sex characteristics, the detection is often delayed, till puberty. For instance, when menarche is not reached by a female teenager, further testing may reveal the DSD. Other DSDs can be easily detected at birth due to atypical genital appearances.\n\nDSDs can co-exist with high testosterone levels as is the case with South African runner, Caster Semenya, whose prolonged battle continues before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Semenya is challenging the World Athletics regulations that female athletes with DSDs must medically reduce their testosterone levels to qualify for participation.\n\nThe recent boxing row has highlighted the fact that biological sex and gender lie across a spectrum. But even in days gone by, when sex was defined in the binary of male and female, gender remained a contentious issue at the Olympics.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1998, female athletes were required to prove their femininity. The premise was that it was necessary to prevent men from posing as women and using their innate genetic advantage to win the competition unfairly. At the time, the tests involved visual inspection of anatomy dubbed the 'nude parade'. If a woman wanted to participate in the Olympics, she had no choice but to undergo the examination. Eventually, the Olympics moved on to more sophisticated testing -- cellular tests, gene tests, etc.\n\nToday, the IOC guidelines aptly titled, \"IOC framework on fairness, inclusion and non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex variations\" seek to 'promote a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.' However, the guidelines are not binding law. In fact, the guidelines acknowledge the authority of the governing body of each sport to determine whether or not an athlete has a disproportionate advantage over their peers. And so the gender wars continue.\n\nBut are there any real-world solutions? Should players be matched on testosterone and chromosomal levels? It's not quite as simple. Because such compulsory tests would mean subjecting players to many unnecessary and often humiliating medical tests, infringing upon their rights. Moreover, where does one draw the line in terms of levelling the playing field? Should limb length also be measured? In such cases, Michael Phelps has an atypical, advantageous wing span, wherein his arm span is more than his height.\n\nWhen questioned about solutions, Mitra said: \"I cannot comment on solutions, nor is it my job. However, the IOC's decision with regard to Khelif is laudable and reflects a commitment towards human rights.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the two boxers at the heart of the controversy have moved on, with Carini publicly apologising: \"I'm sorry for my opponent, too. If the IOC said she can fight, I respect that decision.\" Khelif, on her part, continues to soar, as she storms into the women's boxing finals after beating Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng, slated for August 10.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "view_all@hindustantimes.com", "name": "View All", "type": "author",

We were also told that these kinds of tests are and can be against human rights because they are too intrusive. Then the new system was developed in great agreement with everybody. And I think this is since 1999 or 2000 that this system has been working. Therefore, our decision is very clear. Women must be allowed to take part in women's-competitions,\" said Bach.\n\nKhalif will be competing for a gold medal in the final of the women's 66 kg boxing at the ongoing Paris Olympics. Khalif, who was banned from competing in world championships following failures in testosterone and gender eligibility tests, achieved a controversial win over Italy's Angela Carini within just 46 seconds after her opponent quit in the opening round.\n\nNow in the semifinals, she defeated Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand by 5-0, via win by points. Imane will be battling China's Yang Liu for the top prize on August 10. The win over Carini drew adverse comments from many prominent people like JK Rowling and Elon Musk who took to social media questioning the gender of Khelif.\n\nJust before her gold medal bout in the International Boxing Association (IBA) Women's Championships held in New Delhi last year, Khelif was disqualified as she had failed to meet IBA's eligibility criteria. She was not allowed to compete due to elevated testosterone levels, as per ESPN.\n\nBut she was allowed to compete in the Paris Olympics by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) task force, which is running past two Olympic boxing events as IBA has been banned from the past two years from the Olympics due to governance issues, lack of financial transparency and instances of corruption in judging and refereeing.\n\nMUST READ: Here's How Arshad Nadeem's Village Pooled In Money To Send Him To Olympics\n\nIOC defended the rights of Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, another boxer under scrutiny due to failing an unspecified eligibility requirement in a biochemical test, to compete in the Olympics.\n\nReplying to the controversy, the IOC said on Thursday in a statement, \"All athletes participating in the boxing tournament of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations set by the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU). As with previous Olympic boxing competitions, the gender and age of the athletes are based on their passports.\"\n\n\"These rules also applied during the qualification period, including the boxing tournaments of the 2023 European Games, Asian Games, Pan American Games and Pacific Games, the ad hoc 2023 African qualifying tournament in Dakar (SEN) and two world qualifying tournaments held in Busto Arsizio (ITA) and Bangkok (THA) in 2024, which involved a total of 1,471 different boxers from 172 National Olympic Committees (NOCs), the Boxing Refugee Team and Individual Neutral Athletes, and featured over 2,000 qualification bouts,\" the IOC statement read.\n\nThe IOC said that the athletes in question had been subjects of an arbitrary decision by the International Boxing Association earlier.\n\n\"We have seen in reports misleading information about two female athletes competing at the Olympic Games Paris 2024. The two athletes have been competing in international boxing competitions for many years in the women's category, including the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, International Boxing Association (IBA) World Championships and IBA-sanctioned tournaments.\n\nThese two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA. Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process,\" the IOC said.\n\n(With Inputs From ANI)", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType":

According to the results of the tests, it was proved that they have XY chromosomes. Such athletes were excluded from competition,\" Kremlev said.\n\nWith a constant stream of questions over boxer Imane Khelif's gender, Yacine Arab went on the attack, saying, \"The Zionist lobby wants to break Khelif's spirit, but she is strong. They don't want to see an Arab or Muslim woman succeed in boxing.\"\n\nKhelif has been defiant over the controversy and even shot back at the critics.\n\n\"I dedicate this medal to the world and to all the Arabs, and I tell you, 'Long live Algeria!'\" the boxer told reporters after winning the most recent match in Paris.\n\n\"I want to tell the entire world that I am a female, and I will remain a female,\" the Algerian added.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Boxing Association reiterated that Khelif was disqualified from fighting last year after registering with male XY chromosomes in a gender test.\n\n\"Based on DNA tests, we identified a number of athletes who tried to trick their colleagues into posing as women. According to the results of the tests, it was proved that they have XY chromosomes.

While IBA remains committed to ensuring competitive fairness in all of our events, we express concern over the inconsistent application of eligibility criteria by other sporting organizations, including those overseeing the Olympic Games.

But the International Olympic Committee should never have allowed the ugly spectacle to happen. Both athletes are now guaranteed to win medals -- Algeria's Khelif as a welterweight, Taiwan's Lin as a featherweight. But both still face questions, a year after the International Boxing Association (IBA) publicly raised the issue, over whether they have XY chromosomes and a disorder of sexual development -- also known as an intersex condition -- which give them an unfair advantage over other women. Some boxers who have lost to Lin or Khelif at the Paris Games have protested by making double-X gestures, a reference to female chromosomes, with their fingers.\n\nThe Olympic bosses have screwed this one up with their ill-preparedness, buck-passing, and passion for incomprehensible language. (The \"Portrayal Guidelines\" issued ahead of the Paris Games instruct journalists that the phrase biologically male is \"problematic,\" but without that phrase, explaining the debate becomes impossible.) Social-media commentators have confused and inflamed the situation with inaccurate posts. Right-wing politicians and influencers have piled on, suggesting that these athletes are simply men punching women. Meanwhile, traditional media have often floundered, unable to describe accurately where the disagreement actually rests. The result is a bitter debate fueled by misinformation on many sides, in a sport where matching the size and strength of competitors is vital for safety as well as fairness.\n\nLast year, the IBA disqualified both Khelif and Lin from its Women's World Championship, saying that the boxers had failed tests to determine their eligibility to compete. The IBA's leadership has since indicated without providing detail that these were genetic tests that revealed that the two women have XY chromosomes. The IBA and the Olympics fell out several years ago over claims of corruption and mismanagement, and boxing federations in the United States and Britain have broken with the Russian-led association. The IOC argues that the IBA's testing is flawed and used its own eligibility guidelines for women's boxing -- a passport check, which both Khelif and Lin passed. The Olympic rules state that, as a general principle, athletes \"should be allowed to compete in the category that best aligns with their self-determined gender identity.\"\n\nMaggie Mertens: Separating sports by sex doesn't make sense\n\nIn boxing, though, biology really matters. One of the most established sex differences between male and female bodies is upper-body strength, which in boxing means that men can punch much harder. The women's category is not just about fairness, but about safety. That is why it was such an incendiary moment when Italy's Angela Carini stopped her match against Khelif after taking a punch to the face, telling reporters afterward, \"It could have been the match of a lifetime, but I had to preserve my life as well in that moment.\" (She has since apologized for how she handled the fight.)\n\nOlympic bosses have taken to giving press conferences where they seem annoyed to be asked questions, which they then answer inaccurately. Why have the IOC's statements been so misleading and nebulous? Perhaps because it does not want to compromise the athletes' privacy by discussing their medical details without consent. And perhaps because the IOC's leaders are not prepared to defend their own rules, which state that even if Lin and Khelif do have XY chromosomes, they are allowed to compete in Olympic women's boxing.\n\nThe IBA fired back with its own press conference. It was a chaotic, unpleasant event in which the group's leader, Umar Kremlev, ranted in Russian about the supposed disrespect to Christianity shown by the opening ceremony. (With Russia banned from the Paris Games, the Kremlin must be enjoying the IOC's embarrassment on this issue.)\n\nBoth sides have demonstrated a lack of interest in women's sports, and the well-being of all its competitors, that is tantamount to contempt. A simple cheek swab could clear this up, revealing the presence (or not) of a second X chromosome. If either athlete was XY instead, she could have further genetic testing to get a precise diagnosis and determine if it affected her ability to participate fairly. If Lin and Khelif are straightforwardly female athletes with XX chromosomes, they could have appealed their IBA bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an independent body based in Switzerland. (Lin did not do so, according to the IBA, while Khelif withdrew her appeal. The process can be costly for athletes.)\n\nIn recent years, most controversies over eligibility for women's sports have involved trans athletes. IOC President Thomas Bach dismissed the past week's debate as a \"culture war,\" which might be true -- many newly minted women's-boxing enthusiasts have emerged with strong opinions -- but ignores the fact that addressing intersex conditions is an ongoing challenge in women's sports. Trying to suppress people's questions doesn't work, and just makes life harder for the athletes involved.\n\nFor years, doubts over the South African runner Caster Semenya were deemed to be racist, and rival runners who questioned her eligibility in the female category suffered abuse and death threats. Yet the court's judgment in her case revealed that she was not simply, as she had often been described, a female runner with \"naturally high testosterone.\" She had male XY chromosomes and a condition called 5ARD.\n\nAlthough genetically male, people with the condition lack a crucial enzyme, 5-alpha reductase, which means that as fetuses, their bodies cannot process a masculinizing hormone called DHT, which helps determine how the reproductive system develops. They are therefore born with internal testes but external female genitalia -- and thus many are raised as girls. At puberty, their internal testes start to produce a different masculinizing hormone, testosterone, which their bodies are able to metabolize. And so they develop typically male muscle mass and proportions, and their genitalia take on a more male appearance. At this point, some people with 5ARD feel more comfortable identifying as men rather than as women.\n\nSteve Magness: There's good reason for sports to be separated by sex\n\nThis is why the IOC's insistence that Lin and Khelif were \"born as women\" -- a phrase banned by its own guidelines, but never mind -- is unenlightening. With 5ARD, a child can be registered as female at birth, but later develop a significant athletic advantage during puberty from the effects of testosterone. Some other intersex conditions, such as complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, in which a genetically male body is completely unable to process masculinizing hormones in the womb and throughout puberty, provide no edge in sports and so are not a barrier to competing as a female.\n\nAfter the court ruling, Semenya was asked to reduce her testosterone levels to compete in the female category; she declined. \"For me I believe if you are a woman, you are a woman,\" she said at the time. Semenya, who retired from athletics and is raising a young family with her wife, has since written a book about how she found the scrutiny over her case humiliating and degrading. Many athletes subjected to previous forms of sex verification -- which involved genital inspections and even \"naked parades\" -- have said the same. Added to that, many people with 5ARD have no idea of their condition until adolescence, when they are forced to reassess their identity at a profound level. To have your sense of self challenged like this must be an extraordinarily tough experience -- even more so amid a social-media circus.\n\nWorld Athletics, the governing body for running, track and field, and related sports, has tightened its rules since Semenya was competing, as have authorities in other sports -- and the IOC defers to them, having scrapped its own sex testing in the 1990s. World Rugby in particular should be praised for holding a long and impressive consultation period during which the organization heard from all sides. Sporting bodies regulate the use of shoes and swimsuits that give competitors even a tiny boost, so it's no wonder that they would need policies governing athletes who identify as women but have male chromosomes and high testosterone levels. \"The performance gap between males and females becomes significant at puberty and often amounts to 10-50% depending on sport,\" the academics Emma Hilton and Tommy Lundberg found after analyzing the data. The fastest women's 100-meter sprint time is 10.49 seconds, a record held by Florence Griffith-Joyner; the men's record, held by Usain Bolt, is nearly a whole second faster, at 9.58 seconds. Victory hinges on far smaller margins; 0.005 seconds separated the gold and silver medalists in the men's 100-meter sprint earlier this week.\n\nDoriane Coleman: Why Biden's new school-sports rule matters\n\nNow, one can argue that the benefits of male puberty are overstated: The sports scientist Joanna Harper, who is herself a runner and a trans woman, has queried just how big an advantage biologically male athletes who suppress their testosterone really have. That's a question that can be investigated and answered empirically. But too many people who have sprung to Khelif's and Lin's defense have assumed that bigotry is the only possible motivation for their opponents. \"Challenge: find a single person whining about trans people in women's sports who has done or said anything supportive of women's sports previously,\" David Roberts, a popular science influencer, posted on X. Okay then, challenge accepted: the tennis legend Martina Navratilova. The boxing champion Nicola Adams. The former swimmer Sharron Davies. Shall I go on?\n\nThis debate is not about whether to accept someone's sense of their own gender, or about an intolerance of gender nonconformity -- both Navratilova and Adams are lesbians who faced abuse for their appearance during their career. After all, a transgender boxer is competing in these Games with absolutely no pushback at all. Hergie Bacyadan, a Filipino trans man -- a biological female -- is competing in a women's event. He has no sporting advantage, because he has chosen not to take testosterone to masculinize his body. During the same American collegiate swimming season when the transgender woman Lia Thomas became a national talking point, another trans swimmer was competing in the female division. His name was Iszac Henig, and he was a trans man who had undergone a mastectomy but stayed off hormones. Henig also competed fairly against other biological females, with no backlash at all.\n\nThose two examples show that the current debates over gender and sports are not simply driven by prejudice -- although the subject has undoubtedly attracted bigots and provocateurs. The debate should be a respectful one grounded in evidence about the effects of testosterone and male puberty. Sporting categories are not inherently offensive or degrading: We don't let flyweights take on heavyweights. Having clear, transparent, and well-accepted rules would stop individual athletes from being subjected to cruel and embarrassing questions -- and would prevent the discussion from being hijacked by culture-war bomb-throwers.\n\nImane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting have been through hell over the past week, and the determination and discipline they have shown are admirable. But if the questions around their eligibility remain unresolved, the medals they win will always have an asterisk next to them. That isn't fair to them, or to their opponents.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_lewis@theatlantic.com", "name": "Helen

But we cannot wait longer than the end of next year,\" Bach told a press conference when asked when the IOC would decide on the sport's inclusion or not for Los Angeles. The Olympic body has said it will not run the boxing competition at the next Games.\n\nA new organisation called World Boxing was launched in 2023 and currently has 37 members, still far fewer than the IBA, but it is not recognised by the IOC.\n\nThe IOC suspended the IBA in 2019 over governance, finance, refereeing and ethical issues and did not involve it in running the boxing events at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, before stripping it of recognition in 2023.\n\nThe IOC and IBA have been at loggerheads for days during the Paris Olympics over the participation of two female boxers, Algeria's\n\nImane Khelif\n\nand Taiwanese\n\nLin Yu-ting\n\n.\n\nThe IBA banned them midway through last year's World Championships following a chromosome test, citing gender ineligibility, but the IOC has\n\nallowed them both to compete\n\n, saying they are women.

I have never seen such pandemonium at a press conference,\" Badel said on the Matty & The Missile podcast.\n\n\"Jacquelin Magnay, my esteemed colleague, has done 15 Olympics. She says it was the wildest press conference she has ever seen. That just encapsulates what we saw today.\"\n\nIBA officials including Kremlin-linked Russian oligarch Umar Kremlev, the organisation's president, who was on a remote video call, gave a series of contradictory statements to a room packed full of reporters.\n\nThe officials said they were also constrained by medical confidentiality. What was clear was when Ioannis Filippatos, former chairman of the IBA's medical committee, said \"abnormalities\" were detected in blood tests in 2022.\n\nThe two boxers were tested again in 2023 to confirm the initial findings, IBA officials said, and after that they were disqualified.\n\nIOC president Thomas Bach and high-level officials from Algeria and Taiwan have strenuously defended Khelif and Lin, saying they were born and raised as women, and have passports saying that.\n\nThe Olympic body, which has effectively expelled the IBA from the Olympic movement, has accused the IBA of making \"an arbitrary decision\" over disqualifying the duo in 2023.\n\nBadel went on to add that the conduct of some journalists at the press conference was \"disgraceful\", likening it to that of reporters \"masquerading as activists\".\n\n\"There were 200 journalists and what was originally designed to be an explanation from the IBA as to why they kicked the two XY athletes out of last year's World Championships turned into bedlam where some of the conduct of the journalists was disgraceful,\" he said.\n\n\"They were attacking the IBA, there were journalists almost masquerading as activists, not so much asking questions as giving opinions.\"\n\nThe IBA were also accused of dealing with the Russian mafia, with Badel explaining that links back to Kremlev's background and a result at last year's World Championships.\n\n\"The president of the IBA, Umar Kremlev, is Russian,\" Badel explained.\n\n\"There is a view there is Russian influence and that was behind why the two athletes were rubbed out of the World Championships because one of the athletes beat a Russian in that tournament and so there was a view there was corruption involved.\"\n\nThere was also a moment when an Algerian supporter of Khelif, who Badel said is a boxer in a lower weight class, interrupted the press conference after walking in with an Algerian flag.\n\n\"All the journalists started interviewing her so we basically had two press conferences going on,\" Badel said.\n\n\"It was just wild and it was a circus.\"\n\nKhelif fights in the semifinals at 6.34am on Wednesday morning AEST while Lin fights Esra Yildiz Kahraman on Thursday morning.\n\nOLYMPIC CHAMPION'S INJURY 'NEGLECT' ACCUSATION\n\nSouth Korea's sports ministry said Tuesday it would investigate allegations by new Olympic badminton champion An Se-young that she was neglected by her national federation while injured.\n\nWorld number one An swept to gold on Monday in Paris with a 21-13, 21-16 victory over China's He Bingjiao.\n\nShortly after, the 22-year-old An shocked fans at home in South Korea by telling reporters: \"I think it may be difficult to continue with the national team after this moment.\" An accused the Korea Badminton Association of not providing adequate support while she was suffering from a knee injury sustained last year.\n\nAn said she had to compete in pain because of the injury and had even been initially misdiagnosed regarding its severity.\n\n\"I was so disappointed with (the association) during my injury. I really can't get over those moments,\" An told reporters, without getting into further details.\n\nShe accused the association of \"neglecting\" its responsibilities. The sports ministry issued a statement Tuesday saying it planned to \"ascertain the exact facts as soon as the Olympics conclude\" and \"review the need for appropriate improvement measures based on the findings\".\n\nThe ministry \"plans to examine whether there are areas for improvement in athlete management across other sports as well,\" it added.\n\nIn a separate interview with South Korea's Yonhap News Agency published early Tuesday, An was quoted as saying the association had decided she would not be competing in certain events without providing her with any explanation.\n\nShe further accused the current training system of being outdated and not entirely safe for athletes, claiming it fails to \"train in a way that prevents injuries or take proper measures if an injury occurs\".\n\nAn said the country's doubles players -- who have enjoyed more success in international competitions -- were prioritised for training and medical support over singles players.\n\n\"I found my motivation in my anger as I set my goals and pursued my dreams,\" the new Olympic champion told Yonhap.\n\n\"I wanted to make my voice heard. In a way, my dream was (to have) a 'voice.'\"\n\nTraining for open water swimming at the Paris Olympics was cancelled on Tuesday due to poor water quality in the River Seine -- the fifth time organisers have acted to protect athletes' health.\n\nThe first four occasions were related to triathlon events in the French capital, with the men's triathlon postponed by a day.\n\nThe Seine has been the focus of attention during the Games, consistently failing water quality tests despite a 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) upgrade to improve the Paris sewerage and water treatment systems.\n\nOrganisers issued a statement early Tuesday saying the marathon swimming \"familiarisation session\" would not go ahead.\n\n\"After the daily situation meeting this morning between Ville de Paris, Paris 2024 and World Aquatics, it has been decided that the familiarisation session to take place today, 6 August 2024 is cancelled,\" the statement said.\n\nSeveral triathletes had expressed frustration over the repeated cancellations and uncertainty.\n\nThe River Seine was judged clean enough to stage the mixed triathlon relay on Monday following uncertainty over pollution levels and illness in the build-up.\n\nThe race turned out to be a thriller, Germany's Laura Lindemann holding off a fierce challenge from the United States and Britain to take gold.\n\nThe women's 10-kilometre marathon swim is due to take place early Thursday, with the men's event listed for the following day.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"},

The IBA's tests, which contributed to its loss of governing status, were deemed unreliable by the IOC.\n\nDavies, a silver medalist in the 1980 Olympics, expressed concern that the boxers' defeated opponents might be too intimidated to contest the results. Speaking on a panel for Sex Matters, a campaign group focused on women's rights, Davies stated, \"You'd like to think that there ought to be (a route to legal challenge), from a duty of care perspective.\n\n\"It is the job of any organisation, whether that is a school or a sports club or a governing body, or, in fact, a world governing body like the IOC, to have a responsibility to safety. At the moment they are definitely negligent in this area when it comes to female athletes. They are not considering the damage, the potential damage, of putting a male athlete in with a female athlete. So if I was one of those female athletes, I would be trying to pursue this for sure.\n\n\"The problem we've got is that these female athletes are very young. They are very intimidated. They are very silenced. And the IOC puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the government and the national associations to make their athletes sign documentation which stops them, which takes away their voices. And that is also a problem that we have.\"\n\nKhelif and Lin made headlines when Italian boxer Angela Carini withdrew from her bout against Khelif after just 46 seconds, claiming she had never been hit so hard. In recent bouts, Lin's opponents have made an X with their fingers, seemingly protesting the IBA's alleged finding that Lin, and Khelif, have male XY chromosomes.\n\nThe IBA has not published the results of gender tests on Khelif and Lin due to non-disclosure clauses. Chris Roberts, the IBA Secretary General, stated that the athletes have a \"duty\" to the sport to be transparent and urged them to undergo additional testing and disclose the results. He said, \"They owe it to their opponents and their community to be upfront and to be honest about all of this. They owe that to their opponents. And, you know, I call for them to have another test, if that's the case.\"\n\nDavies criticised the IOC for failing women throughout her career and continuing to do so. She remarked, \"People have to look back at the history of the IOC and their horrendous history of looking after female athletes.\" Davies spoke out, recalling how the IOC permitted the East German state to administer testosterone to young female athletes for 20 years.\n\nShe said, \"The reason I speak out is, for 20 years, they allowed the East German state to dope young women, 11, 12, 13 years old, full of testosterone. Every single person in the track, in the swimming pool, at the rowing venue, knew exactly what was going on. The IOC did nothing.\n\n\"For 20 years they allowed female athletes to be cheated out of their medals and they allowed these young East German girls to be poisoned, to the state that all of them have health issues, and many of them have died. The history of the IOC defending female athletes is atrocious.\"\n\nIn response, an IOC spokesperson stated, \"All athletes participating in the boxing tournament of Paris 2024 comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also noted, \"The guidelines on athlete expression for Paris 2024... provide a framework for athletes and other Games participants to express their views during the Games and are fully in line with the guidelines implemented for Tokyo 2020 and the Winter Games Beijing 2022,

Explaining the governing body issue facing 2028 LA Games after IBA controversy", "body": "As the relationship between the IBA and the IOC disintegrated, the latter was forced to govern boxing for both the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 tournaments. However, that will not be the case at Los Angeles 2028 as doubt hangs over the sport's future at the Olympic Games.\n\nIt's been over a year since the IBA was officially removed from the Olympic family and no global organization has taken its place. Subsequently, the IOC has made it clear that if no replacement is found within the next six months then the Los Angeles 2028 program will not include boxing.\n\nMORE: Olympic boxing results: Updated 2024 medal winners at Paris Games\n\nOver the past several decades, the Olympic Games have produced some of the greatest fighters in boxing history. Names like Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya and Lennox Lewis are synonymous with their respective gold medals which served as a springboard to Hall of Fame careers.\n\nWill boxing get off the canvas and fight on within the pinnacle of amateur sporting competition, or will it be counted out?\n\nThe Sporting News looks at where things stand with the sport and its inclusion at the Olympic Games going forward.\n\nMORE: Fact-checking the Imane Khelif Olympic boxing controversy\n\nThe program for Los Angeles 2028 currently has 36 sports included and boxing isn't one of them.\n\n\"We would love to see boxing; we want to see boxing on the program in LA. Now it is up to the boxing community to organize themselves for the sport and for the athletes,\" IOC spokesperson Mark Adams told a press conference via Reuters.\n\nIn April, the IOC made it clear that a new global organization would have to be in place by early 2025, presumably to give them enough time to get things organized.\n\nAnother governing body named World Boxing has some support from key countries but has not been accepted officially.\n\n\"The popularity of boxing in America is important and its ability to have kids from all socioeconomic walks of life be able to participate in it is powerful and important,\" said LA28 CEO Casey Wasserman via dawn.com\n\n\"We've always said that we've got to figure out a way to get boxing in the Games in 2028 but as we sit here today... it is not on our schedule and we don't have a venue for it.\"\n\nMORE: Top 11 Olympic boxing champions who became all-time greats as professionals\n\nIn 2020, Russian sports magnet Umar Kremlev was elected President of the IBA. Operations were moved from Switzerland to Russia, and the country's energy giant Gazprom became the sole sponsor of the organization.\n\nWhen it emerged that IBA debts of over $20 million were suddenly cleared, the IOC strongly opposed Gazprom's association. The controversy continued when Ukraine was suspended by the IBA following the Russian invasion in 2022.\n\nThese publicized events led to the complete breakdown of the relationship between the IBA and the IOC. The latter took control of the boxing competition at Tokyo 2020 and removed the IBA from governance in the summer of 2023.\n\nBoxing has been a mainstay of the modern Olympics since 1904. Since that time, the only Games that didn't feature the sport was Stockholm 1912 because Sweden had a permanent ban on boxing.\n\nBy the time Paris 2024 concludes, the Olympics will have hosted 28 boxing tournaments over the past 120 years.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A victory would bring a little levity to the athlete who, since the start of the Olympic Games, has above all borne a target on her back. Since her victory by forfeit in the round of 16 against Italy's Angela Carini on Thursday, August 1, she has been accused of being a man, one who deliberately competed in the wrong category, or even of promoting violence against women.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Khelif's androgynous physique has raised questions in boxing circles. Like Taiwan's Lin Yu-Ting - currently in the featherweight final event at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games - in March 2023, Khelif was disqualified in the middle of the tournament at the IBA Women's World Boxing Championships in New Delhi, on the grounds of non-compliance with \"eligibility criteria,\" just as she was about to compete in the final. At the time, she had denounced it as a \"great conspiracy\" against Algeria.\n\nThe president of the International Boxing Federation (IBA), Umar Kremlev, told the Russian news agency TASS at the time that the two boxers had \"tried to pass themselves off as women\" even though they allegedly had \"XY chromosomes.\" Recently, the IBA confirmed that it had conducted a test \"whereby the specifics remain confidential,\" the result of which allegedly revealed that they had \"competitive advantages over other female competitors.\" The federation has stated that its definition of a man is an \"individual with chromosome XY.\" According to Kremlev, who is close to the Kremlin and its essentialist, conservative view of gender, these athletes are men, and should be excluded from women's competitions.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has stated the opposite position, and considered both boxers to, on the contrary, be eligible to compete in women's boxing. On August 3, its president, Thomas Bach, defended the pair as \"two boxers who were born as a woman, who have been raised as a woman, who have a passport as a woman and who have competed for many years as a woman.\"\n\nAttacks from the IBA, J.K. Rowling and Donald Trump\n\nThe opposition between the IOC and the IBA runs deep. The two institutions are at loggerheads, with the IOC having withdrawn its recognition of the IBA in 2023, after several corruption scandals. The IBA's essentialist vision, which presupposes a biological, natural and absolute difference between men and women, has also been seen by its supporters as opposed to the inclusive, so-called \"woke,\" vision they believe the IOC advocates.\n\nThis interpretation is shared by influential transphobic figures such as novelist J.K. Rowling. She saw Khelif's victory as characterized by \"the smirk of a male\" at \"a woman he's just punched in the head,\" ironically referring to the \"new men's rights movement.\" Entrepreneur Elon Musk deemed it \"obviously terribly unfair\" that Khelif and Yu-Ting were able to take part in the women's Olympics events.\n\nMany far-right political leaders added their voices to these complaints. \"Enough with the madness of 'woke' ideology!\" Italian Lega Nord party leader Matteo Salvini raged, while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her wish for \"a finally fair competition,\" in posting her support for Carini. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump pledged to \"keep men out of women's sports.\"\n\nIn France, pro-Kremlin conspiracy circles were quick to pick up on the IBA's talking points. For example, conspiracy theorist and influencer Silvano Trotta, who expressed his certainty that \"neither Lin nor Khelif are biological women.\" An edited image showing Khelif in front of a scene displaying queer deities from the Paris Olympic Games' opening ceremony epitomizes the far-right networks' accusations against the \"woke\" Olympic Games, which would allegedly be an assault on traditional Christian values. Except that Khelif was neither born male nor is she transgender.\n\nBiological stereotypes\n\nCaught in the middle of this cultural battle, the Algerian boxer has been subjected to numerous misconceptions likening her to a man, and even accusations of cheating. First and foremost, IBA president Umar Kremlev accused her, in 2023, of \"trying to deceive\" her opponents. While the precise reason for Khelif's androgynous physique is not known, and has been the subject of speculation, the criticisms levelled at her are often based on reductive biological stereotypes.\n\nFor example, those internet users who have denied her femininity often assume that the combination of X and Y chromosomes is unique to men, whereas there are exceptions linked to disorders of sexual development (DSDs), as in the cases of Swyer syndrome or 5\u03b1-Reductase 2 deficiency. They also presume that testosterone - which is often used to distinguish men and women - is an exclusively male hormone, even though it is also produced by ovaries (albeit in much smaller quantities), and some so-called \"hyperandrogenic\" women produce a lot of it.\n\nA final stereotype posits that the two main biological genders are clearly distinguishable, denying the existence of more complicated cases. For example, a scientific meta-analysis from 2000 estimated the proportion of intersex individuals - in other words, people with sexual characteristics that do not correspond to the traditional definition of their gender, and fall outside a binary classification - at 1.7% of live human births.\n\nSocial media manipulation\n\nA naive vision of biology? That's not all. These uninformed judgments on social media are also coupled with manipulative presentations. Many anti-woke Internet users, armed with zoomed-in images and fluorescent circles, highlight the slightest shadow on Khelif's shorts to assert that she has a penis. Others deconstruct her every move to insinuate that they betray the presence of male genitalia. Trotta, for example, found an archival photo from a French regional press outlet to categorically assert that she \"wears testicle protection for men.\" It is indeed a type of protective garment designed for men, but \"there's nothing exceptional about it. Female boxers are used to wearing [them] when training, it's more comfortable,\" explained French Olympic champion Brahim Asloum, recontextualizing the matter.\n\nThe disinformation was sometimes blatant, such as in an excerpt from an Arabic-language TV interview, which has been shared online since early August, accompanied by a suspicious translation: \"In 2017 we were little boys... I was perceived as a future Olympic champion... I am an Algerian soldier.\" As French television channel TF1 has pointed out, Khelif actually said: \"We were little children\" and indeed identifies herself as a woman throughout the entire interview.\n\nConspiracy theorist circles close to the far right are no strangers to tracking down alleged transsexuals, and never tire of inventing pseudo-evidence. The same type of procedure was used to try and prove that French First Lady Brigitte Macron is, in fact, a man, in a disinformation campaign started at the end of 2021, as well as to denigrate Michelle Obama.\n\nDoubts going back almost a century\n\nThe issue of the eligibility of hyperandrogenic female athletes has rocked the sporting world for the past 15 years, with the questions raised by South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya's crushing victory in the 800m final of the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. In the name of sporting fairness, in 2018 World Athletics (then the International Association of Athletics Federations) imposed the use of testosterone inhibitors on hyperandrogenic women. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that she was a victim of discrimination, but her participation in sporting events nevertheless remains dependent on taking hormonal inhibitors with significant side effects.\n\nThis is not a first. As far back as 1936, German Olympic high jump champion Dora Ratjen had surprised many observers with her masculine physique. A mix-up at birth, linked to genitalia that were difficult to identify, had led her parents to identify and raise her as a girl, according to an investigation by Der Spiegel. Renamed Heinrich, he underwent an administrative gender change. His gold medal was confiscated and his records were erased.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_audureau@lemonde.fr", "name": "William Audureau", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Broadcasting_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Broadcasting Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Essentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Androgyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

MOFA condemned Polyanski's referral to \"false statements from the International Boxing Association (IBA).\"\n\nThe ministry reiterated that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has repeatedly confirmed Lin's eligibility to compete. It pointed out that the IOC revoked the IBA's right to organize Olympic boxing events as early as 2019, and later stripped the IBA of its status as the governing body for boxing in 2023, rendering the organization devoid of international credibility.\n\nMOFA said Polyanskiy had \"arbitrarily cited false accusations from the International Boxing Association without verifying the facts, and misused the Security Council venue to purport fallacies irrelevant to maintaining international peace and security.\" The ministry said this fully highlights Russia's \"disregard for international rules and justice, its intention to use political power to influence the Olympic games, and its inherently arrogant nature.\"\n\nThe ministry called on the international community to unite in condemnation and jointly uphold the Olympic spirit of \"friendship, unity, and fair competition\".\n\nReferring to Lin and Algerian boxer Imane Khelif during the Security Council meeting, Polyanskiy claimed that at the Paris Olympics, \"female boxers are being publicly subjected to violence on the part of athletes who had previously failed hormonal tests done by the International Boxing Federation and, according to the Federation and according to common sense, are men,\" reported Reuters.\n\nPolyanskiy described this as a \"repellent sight\" and accused the West of imposing an \"LGBT agenda\" on the world. Senior Algerian diplomat Toufik Koudri countered Polyanskiy's comments by saying \"The courageous boxer Miss Imane Khelif was born a female.

Credit: \u5b8b\u80b2\u5ef7, CC BY-SA 4.0 , via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe upcoming women's boxing final at the Olympics has sparked a heated controversy. The two athletes vying for the gold medal, Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting, both have XY chromosomes. This revelation has ignited a widespread debate over the fairness of their participation in a women's category, raising questions about the rules governing gender and competition in international sports.\n\nImane Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting, who have excelled in their respective bouts to reach the final, now find themselves at the center of a contentious issue that touches on the broader conversation about gender identity and competitive fairness. The fact that both athletes have XY chromosomes, traditionally associated with male genetics, has led to intense scrutiny of the rules that allowed them to compete in the women's division.\n\nCritics argue that the inclusion of athletes with XY chromosomes in women's sports undermines the principle of fair competition, particularly in a physically demanding sport like boxing, where differences in muscle mass and strength can be decisive. They contend that allowing such athletes to compete in women's categories could disadvantage those with XX chromosomes, traditionally associated with female genetics.\n\nSupporters of Khelif and Lin, however, argue that their participation is in line with the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) guidelines, which allow transgender women and those with differences in sexual development to compete in women's events under certain conditions. These guidelines balance inclusivity with fairness, considering factors like testosterone levels and other physiological criteria.\n\nThe controversy has reignited debates that have been simmering in the sports world for years as more athletes who do not fit neatly into traditional gender categories come forward. As the pinnacle of global sports, the Olympic Games have increasingly become a focal point for these discussions, as they bring together competitors from diverse backgrounds and identities.\n\nAs the final match approaches, the tension surrounding this issue is palpable. The outcome of the bout will not only determine the winner of the gold medal but also likely fuel further debate over the rules and policies governing gender in sports. The IOC and other sports governing bodies may face renewed pressure to revisit and possibly revise their guidelines in light of the ongoing controversy.\n\nThe situation also underscores the challenges faced by athletes caught in the crossfire of these debates. For Khelif and Lin, their achievements in reaching the final are overshadowed by the questions surrounding their eligibility, placing them in an uncomfortable spotlight extending far beyond the boxing ring.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "XY sex-determination system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skeletal muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trans woman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chromosome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/08/nj42ap3y34_th_1024x0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803238", "eventUri": "eng-9803238", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Each sport's governing body is responsible for drafting its own eligibility rules, and gender and the IOC accepts the age and gender of athletes on their passports.\n\nTesting has only come back into the discussion due to the IBA's decision to test athletes before the sport's 2023 World Championships.\n\nBoth Yu-ting and Khelif - who identify as females, were assigned females at birth, lived as females their entire lives and have always competed as females - failed the testing despite having boxed for years.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) called the decision to test the athletes before the championship \"sudden and arbitrary\".\n\nIBA chief executive Chris Roberts said XY chromosomes were found in \"both cases\". In most cases, the female is XX, and the male is XY.\n\nHowever, the IBA has refused to go into further deal about how it reached that conclusion, citing privacy reasons.\n\nThe IOC, however, doesn't gender test anymore. So that's what has landed us into the entire circus.\n\nShould those with XY chromosomes be able to fight in the women's category?\n\nThese tests result show that Yu-ting and Khelif are both people with innate variations of sex characteristics.\n\nThe IOC says it is fine for the athletes to compete in female category given that - once again - they identify as females, were assigned female at birth, lived as females their entire lives and have always competed as females.\n\nThe IOC mandated gender verification for female athletes in 1968 until 1998.\n\nIn fact, our very own 2000 Sydney Games decided to abandon it.\n\nIt costs around $150,000 to conduct the testing - and this didn't include volunteers' time which was given by around 60 professionals over up to 90 days.\n\nSecondly, it also put the athletes under more stress at a time when there was already so much pressure.\n\nAnd thirdly, given the absence of males trying to \"masquerade\" as females to compete, the IOC decided to do away with it moving forward.\n\nBut as pressure continues to mount for the IOC to bring the testing back, experts have warned there is a very important fourth reason why the testing should be abandoned.\n\n\"It could be a bit of a raffle,\" Sydney Health Ethics Associate Professor Morgan Carpenter says.\n\n\"There are people that don't know, there are people that are not told [they have any variations of sex].\"\n\nOn top of this, Prof Carpenter, who runs a project on models of care for people with innate variations of sex characteristics, says that people who have any ambiguity to their sex can express it prenatally, in puberty, while trying to conceive a child or during menstruation.\n\nBut for most elite athletes, menstruation and puberty look quite different to the average person - adding another layer of complexity.\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nAt the 1996 Atlanta Olympics - the Games before the testing was abandoned - 3387 female athletes were tested. Eight of them returned a positive result for the SRY gene which is found on the Y chromosome - or one in 423.\n\nIn Barcelona 1992, 2406 were tested, and six returned positive. In Los Angeles 1984, 2500, six were positive.\n\nAcross five games, 11373 female athletes were tested with 27 returning positive results.\n\nThat works out to about one in 421.\n\nGiven there were 5503 female athletes at the Paris Olympics - statistically, that would mean roughly 13 women would have innate variations of sex characteristics.\n\nStatistically, Prof Carpenter says, it could be any of the Olympian champions from any nation.\n\nWhat if all of sudden - one of the Olympic stars of the last few Games suddenly found out that they too had innate variations of sex characteristics?\n\nProf Carpenter says it is more than possible.\n\n\"Disclosure is still a problem, including in high-income countries, including in countries like Australia and New Zealand,\" he said.\n\n\"Historically, and the evidence suggests that this is still sometimes the case, individuals with innate variations of sex characteristics are not informed that they have a variation.\n\n\"Some doctors still believe it's too stigmatising to know. And seeing how demonised people are in the public space ... it lends a bit of weight to that hey?\"\n\nRespect above all\n\nProf Carpenter said he hopes for a more respectful future for Olympians with innate variations of sex characteristics.\n\nThe conversation around Khelif and Yu-ting - especially online - has been nothing short of abhorrent.\n\n\"There is a percentage of people, a very small percentage of people, whose bodies are a bit different, but who still have the same rights to compete and have the right to compete in their birth, assigned birth, observed sex,\" he said.\n\n\"If somebody has been observed assigned female at birth, has lived their life as a woman, understands themselves as a woman, then who has the right to take that away?\"\n\nKhelif will fight for gold in the women's welterweight at 6.51am on Saturday AEST, while Yu-ting's gold-medal bout in the women's featherweight division starts on Sunday August 11 at 5.30am.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au",

It's the latest chapter in the global war over gender, and a string of women just lost everything they trained for at the hands of it.\n\nBy now, most Americans have heard about Italy's Angela Carini, who quit her match earlier this week after a 46-second pummeling at the hands a boxer with male chromosomes. Telling reporters later that she had \"never been hit so hard in her life,\" she fell to her knees and withdrew. \"She's too strong,\" Carini told her coach about Algeria's Imane Khelif. \"I didn't give up,\" she insisted, \"but a punch hurt too much, and so I said I had enough. I go out with my head held high.\"\n\nShe'd been warned it was dangerous, even pressured to drop out before fighting Khelif, but Carini was determined to do what she'd come to Paris to do. Watching from America, women's sports activist and former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines said she felt \"heartbroken.\" \"It was very clear that this athlete was different than the athletes from the fight before.\" In reality, Gaines said of Carini, \"She is the winner. She is a hero for every young girl watching.\"\n\nA handful of days later, on Friday, Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting overpowered Uzbekistan's Sitora Turdibekova to advance to the quarterfinals of women's boxing, despite being disqualified from the 2023 World Championships for also having XY chromosomes. Although Sitroa managed to last three rounds, she ultimately couldn't match Yu-ting's strength and went down in defeat. Since then, both men have clinched medals.\n\nSince Carini's fight, the international uproar has been deafening, even boiling over into the U.S. presidential race. \"I WILL KEEP MEN OUT OF WOMEN'S SPORTS!\" Donald Trump thundered on Truth Social.\n\nBut the situation that's grabbed headlines from New York to Taipei is a little more nuanced than a lot of people realize. As Denny Burk explains, whereas Lia Thomas is absolutely a biological male pretending to be a woman, Khelif's situation is more complicated. \"... [N]either fighter regards himself as transgender, and yet both fighters believe themselves to be female in spite of having XY chromosomes. If these reports are accurate, then it would suggest that they both have some sort of intersex condition,\" which, he goes on to explain, would make them men with \"malformed reproductive anatomy.\"\n\nAnd while \"not all intersex conditions are the same,\" Burk notes, their sex \"is not ambiguous.\" In these instances, the boxers would still be producing \"male-level amounts of testosterone,\" which would make them dominant in sports like boxing. A lot of children who are born intersex are raised and treated as female, which should, he urged, \"evok[e] our compassion and sympathy.\" That said, \"It is neither compassionate nor helpful to pretend that the biological situation is somehow unclear when in fact it is not. And of course the discovery of a genetic male should have implications for athletic competition. Because they are biologically male, people with [this condition] should compete in male divisions, not in female ones.\"\n\nAnd that, critics argue, is where the International Olympic Committee (IOC) went wrong. In the uproar over Carini's rout, committee spokesman Mark Adams claimed, \"I would just say that everyone competing in the women's category is complying with the competition eligibility rules. They are women in their passports.\"\n\nThe International Boxing Association (IBA) vehemently disagreed, which is unsurprising considering that they disqualified both Yu-Ting and Khelif last year. \"While IBA remains committed to ensuring competitive fairness in all of our events, we express concern over the inconsistent application of eligibility criteria by other sporting organizations, including those overseeing the Olympic Games,\" the organization said in a statement. \"The IOC's differing regulations on these matters, in which IBA is not involved, raise serious questions about both competitive fairness and athletes' safety.\"\n\nRegardless of the sympathy these athletes deserve for their condition, no one with XY chromosomes should be fighting women -- in a contact sport like boxing or otherwise. \"[T]he majority of Americans know it's wrong,\" Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) told Family Research Council President Tony Perkins on Thursday's \"Washington Watch.\" \"And you saw on full display the how upset that female boxer was. She probably worked her entire life for this moment. And she has to go up against a male, [and] ... the Olympic Committee even admits that he's a male.\" To Steube and others, \"It's just absolutely horrifying that the Left has perverted all types of women's sports, whether it be Olympic sports, whether it be kids in schools, whether it's women that are losing scholarships in Title IX in the United States, they have perverted it. And we now are seeing it on the world stage. And it's really disgusting.\"\n\nIt's \"unjust,\" Perkins agreed, \"but it's also dangerous.\" A male punch, he wanted people to know, \"can carry about 162% more power than a woman.\" That's what experts mean by a \"biological difference.\" And yet, he shook his head, \"We're playing this charade, and now it's here in the United States. You've tried to stop it,\" he acknowledged in a nod to Steube's Save Women's Sports Act that passed the House earlier this year.\n\nBut the Biden administration \"doesn't care,\" the Florida legislator argued. \"They don't care about ... the safety of women in sports, and they don't care about the fact that there's going to be biological men in your daughters' locker rooms in middle school or in high school or in college. They don't care about that because they are pushing this progressive agenda on the American people. And you saw that with the recent release of Biden's Title IX rules, which flies in the face of why Title IX was created in the first place.\"\n\nThose new rules, which put trans-identifying students above real girls' safety, privacy, and opportunity, has been a constant source of frustration for the states, almost half of whom have sued -- many successfully -- to stop the White House from hurting America's daughters. \"Over 50 years ago ... Title IX was created for women to have an athletic playing field to play each other in sports ... and now they're allowing biological men to compete. It's absolutely ridiculous. I hope it enrages every American and they show up with their feet and they vote against these types of policies, because this is what the Left is today, and this is what the current administration pushes on our kids,\" Steube fumed.\n\nThe Floridian, whose bill with Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) would have also leveled the Olympic playing field for U.S. athletes, put the blame for what we're seeing on the world stage squarely at the feet of the American Left. When the time came to vote on his legislation, he points out, not a single Democrat could bring themselves to protect girls' sports. \"The argument from the Democrats was, 'This never happens. [Girls don't get hurt.] You never see that. [You're] making this up.' And we had example after example that was happening then. And now we see it all the time, and now we're seeing it on the world stage. And they want to push this progressive ideology on America, on the world. And it's just wrong,\" he insisted. \"It's frustrating. It's upsetting. Women have come so far on the athletic playing fields to now have such a setback, and it's completely embraced by the Left. And this is exactly what they want to push on the American people.\"\n\nFor Kamala Harris, that reality will be a difficult one to overcome in the general election. Her longtime advocacy for the trans movement won't sit well with voters, 80% of whom are disgusted by the Biden administration's bulldozing of girls' sports. Already, it's providing ample firepower to the GOP, who's pounced on the Olympics as proof that Kamala is well outside the rational mainstream. \"This is where Kamala Harris's ideas about gender lead,\" Republican vice presidential candidate and Senator J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) posted, \"to a grown man pummeling a woman in a boxing match. This is disgusting, and all of our leaders should condemn it.\"\n\nOthers, like Gaines, want women to know that this is a female candidate who doesn't represent them in the slightest. \"Crickets from Kamala,\" Gaines told Fox's Jesse Waters on the boxing controversy. \"And if I could implore you,\" she said, \"a vote for Kamala is a vote against your daughter's future. I see lots of people on social media saying they'll be voting for Kamala because she's a woman. Well, let me tell you, Jesse, I will be voting for Trump because I am a woman.\"\n\nSo is this a rallying cry, these Olympics? Is this one of those times, Perkins wondered, where people will say, \"Enough of this insanity?\"\n\nSteube certainly hopes so. But to be honest, he acknowledged, \"The only way that we can change this and save women's sports is [to elect] Trump president. We flip the Senate, and we keep the House. That's the only way that this is going to happen.\" Otherwise, he warned, all we're going to get is four more years of a White House claiming they care about women -- only to do everything in their power to erase them.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suzanne_bowdey@christianpost.com", "name": "Suzanne Bowdey",

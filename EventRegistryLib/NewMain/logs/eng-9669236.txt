At least 13 of them had no affiliation with Columbia, the school said.\n\nThe 31 people whose cases were dismissed were students or staff at Columbia, Barnard or Union Theological Seminary.\n\nOf the defendants who will later have their cases dismissed, pending no further arrests, 12 were not staff members or students at Columbia and two were students, the district attorney's office said.\n\nDuring the court appearances Thursday afternoon, a prosecutor said the defendants do not have criminal histories and that they will face internal disciplinary proceedings at Columbia.\n\nA Columbia University official said the disciplinary process is ongoing but declined to comment further.\n\nThe prosecutor said it would have been \"extremely difficult\" to prove the dismissed cases because the district attorney's office lacks evidence, including surveillance footage from cameras that were covered up.\n\nAn attorney for the defendants asked the court to immediately dismiss the charges against all of the accused, saying there are no allegations that the defendants hurt people or damaged property.\n\nIn the downtown courtroom, some of the defendants wore face masks and some wore kaffiyehs, which are distinctly patterned Palestinian scarves. At least two wore sunglasses.\n\nAs the hearings began, police confiscated what appeared to be a protest sign found under one of the seats.\n\nWhen a prosecutor told the court that Carlson was accused of burning an Israeli flag, some of the defendants seated in the room could be heard snickering. A police officer instructed them to be quiet.\n\nHamilton Hall was famously occupied by people protesting the Vietnam War in 1968.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_desecration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag desecration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Theological_Seminary_(New_York_City)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Theological Seminary (New York City)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_protection_helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot protection helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Postgraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240620-hamilton-hall-columbia-protesters-al-0738-404071.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669236", "eventUri": "eng-9669236", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 704, "textEnd": 712}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Donate today\n\nA Manhattan judge on Thursday dismissed and sealed 30 criminal cases against students and staff at Columbia University accused of occupying a campus building during a demonstration against the Israel-Hamas war this spring.\n\nNearly 300 people were arrested at protests at Columbia University and the City College of New York on April 30. While most were issued tickets and sent home, several dozen who faced more serious charges, like trespassing, were temporarily detained and faced prosecution in criminal court. Most Columbia protesters charged in criminal court appeared before a judge on Thursday.\n\nProsecutors charged more than 40 people with third-degree criminal trespass for allegedly breaking into and occupying Hamilton Hall , an academic building on Columbia's Morningside Heights campus, in late April. One case against a student was already dismissed and another non-student defendant recently accepted a plea, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nThe DA's office said in court that it lacked evidence, because surveillance cameras were covered almost immediately after protesters entered Hamilton Hall. Prosecutors said that no police officers were harmed during the arrests and that the students and staff whose cases were dismissed are already facing disciplinary proceedings.\n\nA university official declined to comment but said disciplinary proceedings are ongoing.\n\nMore than a dozen protesters arrested at Columbia on April 30 who aren't students or staff declined offers that would have dismissed their cases later, as long as they followed certain conditions. The defendants' attorneys asked for their cases to be dismissed outright, like the students' cases were.\n\nThe DA's office is also continuing its prosecution of James Carlson, a protester accused of burning an Israeli flag on April 20, among other charges, according to court records. His defense attorney said in court that she disputed the validity of many of the allegations and said Carlson declined an offer to complete a diversion program for one of the lesser charges. As she spoke, Carlson stood beside her with a keffiyeh wrapped around his shoulders.\n\nSupporters crowded the gallery of the second-floor Manhattan courtroom during the proceedings, which lasted less than 20 minutes. Many covered their faces with COVID masks and wore keffiyehs. Afterwards, defendants whose cases were dismissed met with their attorneys while supporters decorated T-shirts, ate pizza and chanted \"Free Palestine\" in a nearby park.\n\nAt a press conference across the street from the Lower Manhattan courthouse, a group criticized prosecutors for giving university-affiliated demonstrators offers that were different from those given to demonstrators who weren't affiliated with the university. They declined to share their names or say whether they were Columbia students.\n\nAt City College, where protesters were accused of occupying a campus building and throwing objects at police during their April 30 arrest, charges have already been dismissed against six students, according to the DA's office. Several people not affiliated with the university declined plea deals, prosecutors said. Prosecutors are also still pursuing cases against several others arrested at City College, including five charged with assaulting police officers.\n\nThe NYPD and Mayor Eric Adams have defended police conduct during the mass arrests on college campuses, while some advocates have raised concerns about the officers' response. One officer accidentally fired a gun while searching a building at Columbia. No one was hit. The NYPD and the DA's office are investigating the incident.", "source": {"uri": "gothamist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gothamist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningside_Heights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morningside Heights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothamist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gothamist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City College of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keffiyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lower Manhattan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://api-prod.gothamist.com/images/345725/fill-1200x650|format-webp|webpquality-85/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669236", "eventUri": "eng-9669236", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 403, "textEnd": 411, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-20", "textStart": 1901, "textEnd": 1909}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

A trove of students and their supporters, many of whom used face masks and keffiyehs to cover their faces, streamed into the building just before 3 p.m., the Free Beacon observed.\n\nInside the courtroom -- where audio and video recording is not allowed -- a prosecutor in Bragg's office argued that the defendants should not face criminal penalties, citing their lack of criminal histories and arguing that the protesters will face internal discipline at Columbia.\n\nThe prosecutor also argued that Bragg's office lacked evidence to land convictions in the cases, given those who occupied Hamilton Hall wore masks and covered up surveillance cameras. New York City police arrested the occupiers while they were inside Hamilton Hall.\n\nThe Free Beacon spotted several Columbia faculty members in the crowd, and the public defender for the protesters made reference to \"Hind's Hall,\" the name student protesters used to refer to Hamilton Hall. Ahead of the proceedings, a Columbia faculty group urged its Instagram followers to \"come on through\" to a \"Pack the Courts for the Hind's Hall 46\" demonstration.\n\nIn total, Bragg's office dismissed charges against 30 individuals arrested for occupying the building. As a result, the large majority of those who occupied Hamilton Hall will not face criminal penalties -- 46 people were arrested and charged in connection with the occupation.\n\nOnce their cases were dismissed, protesters headed outside to hold a defiant press conference. One speaker, whose entire head was covered with a ski mask, said the protesters \"resist the pigs, the police in the U.S.\"\n\n\"This is standing with Palestinian resistance,\" he said. \"This is an interlinking of our struggles -- struggles against carceral violence, against colonialism, against racism, against genocide.\" The speaker, who went by \"Mickey Mouse,\" later said the protesters \"refuse to condemn the Palestinian resistance.\"\n\nThe 30 protesters who saw their cases dismissed Thursday were arrested in an April 30 police sweep of Columbia's Manhattan campus, which came less than 24 hours after they stormed Hamilton Hall, used tables, chairs, and a human chain to block entry to the building, and hoisted an \"intifada\" banner.\n\nOf the 112 people arrested that night, roughly two-thirds were affiliated with the university.", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The prosecutors told 14 other defendants that their cases would be dropped if they could avoid arrests over the next six months, according to NBC News.\n\nIn April, protesters broke into and occupied Columbia University campus building Hamilton Hall, with dozens of students arrested as well as several employees, six students from affiliated schools and 13 people with no affiliation to the university. The district attorney's office is prosecuting one individual who has no affiliation with the school but has two other cases, including for flag burning. (RELATED: Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese Lambasts Columbia Protesters Demanding 'Chicken Nuggets' And 'Applesauce' Deliveries)\n\nProsecutors said that the video footage was obtained from cameras that were covered up, making it difficult to prove identities, according to NBC News.\n\nDuring the court hearing, several of the defendants wore masks, sunglasses and kaffiyehs, with one student holding a protest sign under their seat, which police later confiscated.\n\nSeveral defendants also snickered at the mention of an Israeli flag being burned, according to NBC News.\n\nBragg's office prosecuted former President Donald Trump for falsifying business records, securing a conviction in a Manhattan courtroom last month. To indict Trump on felony charges and get around the fact that the statute of limitations had expired, Bragg argued the records were falsified to conceal or commit another crime -- which he did not prove.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Another 173 were arrested the same night at a separate raid uptown at City College\n\nThirty of those arrested at Hamilton Hall were charged with trespassing, but their lack of criminal history and the \"extremely limited video and security footage\" available to prosecutors hindered any investigation, according to Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Stephen Millan.\n\nSecurity cameras inside Hamilton Hall were almost immediately covered by some of the defendants, who were could not be identified, according to prosecutors.\n\n\"No police officers were injured,\" Millan said. \"It would therefore be extremely difficult for the People to prove any charge other than trespass at trial.\"\n\nDefense attorney Matthew Daloisio, representing the other 16 charged with trespassing, claimed many of his clients were doxxed, or had their personal information publicly exposed online, and \"there is no allegation they damaged property.\"\n\nThose who were arrested at Columbia on April 30 but not charged with trespassing received summonses or desk appearance tickets, instead.\n\nPotential disciplinary actions by the university was also a factor in prosecutors' decision to recommend dismissal of charges, which a Manhattan Criminal Court judge signed off on.\n\nJames Carlson, facing separate charges of arson and criminal mischief for burning an Israeli flag and breaking an NYPD camera, had his case adjourned to July 25.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_keogh@nydailynews.com", "name": "Elizabeth

Daloisio argued that they should have their cases tossed immediately, saying that no one was hurt or damaged property.\n\n\"The only allegation that was different is that they weren't enrolled or currently a faculty member,\" Daloisio told the judge, adding that this group included \"alumni [and] community members concerned of genocide.\"\n\nProsecutors also threw out nine cases -- including six students -- who were charged for occupying a building at the City College of New York protests on April 30.\n\nSeveral police sources could barely contain their disbelief to The Post.\n\n\"Lack of evidence?\" one said. \"Apparently body-worn camera wasn't enough?\"\n\n\"We have a DA giving them what amounts to a mandate to push the envelope further now,\" fumed another veteran cop.\n\nJeffrey Wiesenfeld, who served 15 years as trustee on the governing board for CUNY, said it strained belief that authorities couldn't identify anyone.\n\n\"How can it be that you can't identify a single person?\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

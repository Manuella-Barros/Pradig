Article 35A of the Constitution defines the residency laws in Jammu and Kashmir and bars outsiders from buying any immovable property or applying for jobs in the state government.

They said the plea against Article 35A was part of plans to change the demography of Jammu and Kashmir, which is a Muslim majority state.\n\nYou May Also Like To Watch:\n\nThe separatists said the strike was also against the \"continuous killing of Kashmiris at the hands of Indian forces\".

Saturday hit out at Pakistan for 'interfering' in Jammu and Kashmir, saying that Article 35A, which provides special rights and privileges to permanent residents, was a shield for the people of the state.\n\nPakistan's foreign office Spokesperson Nafees Zakria in a statement on Thursday had accused India of trying to alter the demography of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe main Opposition party also lashed out at the local BJP for giving a \"political and communal color\" to the issue and called for a referendum in Jammu region on Article 35A.\n\nRepresentational image. AFP\n\nThe article empowers state's legislature to define \"permanent residents\" of the state and provide special rights and privileges to those permanent residents.\n\nProvincial president Devinder Singh Rana announced a campaign to educate people about benefits of Article 35A with the inauguration of a seminar by the party working president Omar Abdullah here on 14 August. He would also inaugurate another seminar in Kashmir on the same day.\n\nBlock presidents, block secretaries, district presidents, and district secretaries would participate in it and later disseminate the information at the grass-root level, he said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the party headquarters, he said the statement issued by Pakistan seems to be part of a \"conspiracy to make the issue India versus Pakistan to pave way for its abrogation\".\n\nHe also said if the Article 35A is tinkered with, the Dogras will suffer the most and Article 370 of the Constitution, which gives special status to the state, will be rendered merely a \"skeleton\".\n\n\"The BJP is trying to sell that the Dogras are with it in its demand for revocation of the Article 35A and gives it a communal and regional color. There should be a referendum on the issue in Jammu and Dogras be given a chance to decide whether the law should remain or go.\n\nQuestioning those who term the presidential order as \"illegal\", Rana said if that order is illegal, what about the other orders passed by the president.\n\nHe said the defense of the attorney general and the state in the Supreme Court on the issue was \"weak\" to pave the way for the abrogation of the constitutional provision.\n\nThe Supreme Court last month had asked the Centre to file a reply within three weeks to a writ petition filed by an NGO seeking that Article 35A be struck down.\n\nThe PIL said the state government, under the guise of Article 35A and Article 370, which grants special autonomous status to the state, has been discriminating against non-residents who are debarred from buying properties, getting a government job or voting in the local elections.\n\nThe Centre would explain to the Supreme Court the legal aspects of Article 35A. Attorney General KK Venugopal is expected to explain before the apex court these aspects.\n\nHe said the debate over Article 35A was neither Hindu versus Muslims nor Jammu versus Kashmir.\n\n\"We are part of India and we are Indians. Constitution of India and Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir govern our living and existence but we have been vested with certain rights and we will protect those rights,\" he said.\n\nThe National Conference leader questioned the BJP leadership for introducing a domicile certificate in Himachal Pradesh and of assuring the citizens of Maharashtra of introducing a similar law.\n\n\"In Sikkim, there is article 371A but you don't challenge it,\" he claimed.\n\nRana accused the BJP of deliberately raking up such issues for politics and undermining the safeguards ensured to people of the state by the Constitution.\n\nHe said the people of Jammu were angry at the discrimination with the region, especially during the last three years of the BJP-PDP rule.\n\n\"We demand that the rights of all the people of all the three regions, Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh should be protected and there should be no discrimination.\n\nHe said if Article 35A was abrogated, it would create serious problems for the people of the state, especially Jammu region, as businessmen and shopkeepers would lose their businesses, students lose their scholarships, and various jobs as well.\n\nIn reply to a question about the issue bringing together mainstream and separatists in Kashmir, he said, \"It is the responsibility of people of all three regions to ensure the protection of their rights,\" he said.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 12, 2017 06:23 pm | Updated Date: Aug 12, 2017 06:23 pm\n\nTags :#Article 35a#Devinder singh rana#Dogras#Jammu and kashmir#Kk venugopal#Nafees zakria#National conference#Newstracker#Opposition#Pakistan", "time": "13:07:00"}

opposition National Conference (NC) today hit out at Pakistan for \"interfering\" in Jammu and Kashmir, saying that Article 35A, which provides special rights and privileges to permanent residents, was a shield for the people of the state.\n\nPakistan's Foreign Office Spokesperson Nafees Zakria in a statement on Thursday had accused India of trying to alter the demography of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe main opposition party also lashed out at the local BJP for giving a \"political and communal colour\" to the issue and called for a referendum in Jammu region on Article 35A.\n\nThe article empowers state's legislature to define \"permanent residents\" of the state and provide special rights and privileges to those permanent residents.\n\nProvincial president Devinder Singh Rana announced a campaign to educate people about benefits of Article 35A with the inauguration of a seminar by party working president Omar Abdullah here on August 14. He would also inaugurate another seminar in Kashmir on the same day.\n\nBlock presidents, block secretaries, district presidents and district secretaries would participate in it and later disseminate the information at grassroot level, he said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the party headquarters here, he said the statement issued by Pakistan seems to be part of a \"conspiracy to make the issue India versus Pakistan to pave way for its abrogation\".\n\nHe also said if the Article 35A is tinkered with, the Dogras will suffer the most and Article 370 of the Constitution, which gives special status to the state, will be rendered merely a \"skeleton\".\n\n\"The BJP is trying to sell that the Dogras are with it in its demand for revocation of the Article 35A and gives it a communal and regional colour. There should be a referendum on the issue in Jammu and Dogras be given a chance to decide whether the law should remain or go.\n\nQuestioning those who term the presidential order as \"illegal\", Rana said if that order is illegal, what about the other orders passed by the president.\n\nHe said the defense of the attorney general and the state in the Supreme Court on the issue was \"weak\" to pave the way for abrogation of the constitutional provision.\n\nThe Supreme Court last month had asked the Centre to file a reply within three weeks to a writ petition filed by an NGO seeking that Article 35A be struck down.\n\nThe PIL said the state government, under the guise of Article 35A and Article 370, which grants special autonomous status to the state, has been discriminating against non- residents who are debarred from buying properties, getting a government job or voting in the local elections.\n\nThe Centre would explain to the Supreme Court the legal aspects of Article 35A. Attorney General KK Venugopal is expected to explain before the apex court these aspects.\n\nHe said the debate over Article 35A was neither Hindu versus Muslims nor Jammu versus Kashmir.\n\n\"We are part of India and we are Indians. Constitution of India and Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir govern our living and existence but we have been vested with certain rights and we will protect those rights,\" he said.\n\nThe National Conference leader questioned the BJP leadership for introducing a domicile certificate in Himachal Pradesh and of assuring the citizens of Maharashtra of introducing a similar law.\n\n\"In Sikkim, there is article 371A but you don't challenge it,\" he claimed.\n\nRana accused the BJP of deliberately raking up such issues for politics and undermining the safeguards ensured to people of the state by the Constitution.\n\nHe said the people of Jammu were angry at the discrimination with the region, especially during the last three years of the BJP-PDP rule.\n\n\"We demand that the rights of all the people of all the three regions--Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh--should be protected and there should be no discrimination.\n\nHe said if Article 35A was abrogated, it would create serious problems for the people of the state, especially Jammu region, as businessmen and shopkeepers would lose their businesses, students lose their scholarships, and various jobs as well.\n\nIn reply to a question about the issue bringing together mainstream and separatists in Kashmir, he said, \"It is the responsibility of people of all three regions to ensure protection of their rights,\" he said.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "11:40:00"}

the heart and soul of Article 370 that grants special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir and privileges to the citizens of the state, news that was broken first by Mail Today and followed diligently - has ruffled the separatists as well as principle opposition party in the state, the National Conference.\n\nWhile separatists - hardliner and moderate factions of the Hurriyat Conference and the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) - on Saturday called a bandh in the Valley to protest the serious legal battle that awaits the Constitutional provision in Supreme Court, which the right wing has time and again called a \"fraud on the Parliament\" as it was passed by presidential or executive assent without ever going to the parliamentary process of amendment in 1954, NC accused the BJP to be trying to stoke the fire of communal division among the people.\n\nSEPARATISTS CALLED FOR BANDH\n\nThe separatists said the strike was also against the continuous killing of Kashmiris at the hands of Indian forces. NC alleged that the abrogation of the provision would adversely affect people of Jammu region, a charge vehemently denied by the BJP. Incidentally, RSS-supported think tank Jammu Kashmir Study Circle (JKSC) is one of the petitioners against the controversial article. Also, they have argued that such fundamental provisions as Minority Commission was absent from the state.\n\nThe NC called for a referendum in Jammu on Article 35A. It announced a campaign to educate people about benefits of Article 35A with the inauguration of a seminar by party working president Omar Abdullah on August 14. He would also inaugurate another seminar in Kashmir on the same day. The NC, though, hit out at Pakistan for interfering in J&K. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Nafees Zakria on Thursday had accused India of trying to alter the demography of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nNC provincial president Devinder Singh Rana said the statement issued by Pakistan seemed to be part of a conspiracy to make the issue to pave way for its abrogation. He said the debate over Article 35A was neither Hindu versus Muslims nor Jammu versus Kashmir.\n\n\"We are part of India and we are Indians. Constitution of India and Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir govern our living and existence but we have been vested with certain rights and we will protect those rights.\" The BJP accused the NC of trying to create a fear psychosis among people of Jammu over Article 35A.\n\n\"We are taking a serious note of the statement. Rana tried to create a scary picture of the ill-effects on the people of Jammu if Article 35A is held illegal by the SC. He is creating a fear psychosis,\" BJP state spokesperson Anil Gupta said, adding, \"His statement - Jammu will be affected far more than Kashmir since no outsider will like to settle there but will flock in hordes to settle in Jammu - clearly indicates the mindset of his party that has always advocated politics of exclusion.\"\n\nALSO READ |\n\nJammu and Kashmir: Army jawan killed in Pakistan firing in Krishna Ghati sector Kashmir: Jawan injured in terror attack on army camp in Kupwara\n\nALSO WATCH VIDEO | Kashmir: Terrorists attack Army camp in Kupwara, soldier injured", "time": "01:06:00"}

That is the issue to be decided in the highest court of the land and will be properly scrutinised, he pointed out.\n\nWhen an issue of such great sensitivity is in the court, to claim that Jammu supports this provision is misleading and false, he said.\n\nThe claims of support for Article 35-A in the Jammu region are totally misplaced and the NC should observe the legal nicety of desisting from commenting on an issue with the Supreme Court, he added.\n\n\"In fact, commenting on any issue before the courts and seeking to raise passions is flawed and not proper. The process of a matter being sub-judice needs to be understood and respected,\" he said.\n\nGupta said \"the BJP's stance on Article 370 as also Article 35-A is very well known among people, and does not need to be reiterated here. Rana claims that scrapping Article 35-A will render Article 370 hollow but a decision regarding it can come only from the apex court\".\n\n\"A political party voicing apprehensions about it are out of place,\" he said.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "14:40:00"}

of Commerce also did not see anything wrong in Article 35 A being repealed. (Representational image) Centre to explain to SC legal aspects of Article 35ACentre to explain to Supreme Court legal aspects of Article 35AMufti likely to meet PM, Congress chief on Article 35 A issue\n\nIn the middle of debate on Article 35A, which allows Jammu and Kashmir to define its \"permanent residents\", the constitutional provision seems to have few takers among political parties and other organisations in Jammu. Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party chairperson Harsh Dev Singh described Article 35A as unconstitutional. \"It is void ab initio as it is not passed by Parliament, but has been extended to Jammu and Kashmir by virtue of a Presidential order,\" he said. Kashmiri politicians have been supporting it only to project J&K as different from India, he added.\n\nAshwani Chrungoo, president of Panun Kashmir, a front organisation of migrant Kashmiri Pandits, said there was a need to get rid of the \"stifling statute\" (Article 370) \"coupled with Article 35A, which have provided a constitutional mechanism to promote fissiparous and separatist tendencies in J&K. This Article has created a state within a state and provided justification to so-called sub-nationalism,'' he added.\n\nAnother migrant Kashmiri Pandit leader, Vinod Pandit, chairman of the All-Parties Migrant Coordination Committee, had a similar view. \"If Article 35A comes in the way of development of the state compared to other parts of the country, there will be no hesitation in repealing it,\" he said.\n\nJaved Rahi, general secretary of Tribal Research and Cultural Foundation, said that though tribals were not opposing the Article at present, the constitutional provision had adversely affected their development. He pointed out that people from Gujjar and Bakerwal communities got Scheduled Tribe status way back in 1991, but they did not get political reservation in the state legislature despite the fact that they were the third largest group after Kashmiri Muslims and Dogras.\n\nThe Jammu Chamber of Commerce also did not see anything wrong in Article 35 A being repealed. Even Muslim leaders in Jammu did not speak in support of it. Congress leaders treaded cautiously. \"It is a sensitive and debatable issue and it will be kept in public domain so as to take on board people of all three regions of the state including civil societies,'' said state Congress vice-president Sham Lal Sharma.\n\nPointing out that the issue is sub judice, Sharma said that old laws should be revisited by taking people on board as part of a democratic structure. But before that, the Centre and state government should clear their stand on the issue, he added.\n\nNational Conference provincial president Devender Rana, however, said that state subject laws were brought into force by Maharaja Hari Singh in 1927 to protect Jammu Dogras from the rich people from Punjab. \"It these are removed, the greatest damage would be to Jammu Dogras in terms of economic condition, employment and identity. People of all three regions will suffer,\" he said.\n\nThe BJP, which is in power in the state in alliance with the PDP, also did not support Article 35A. \"It has done damage to the state and the Indian nation,'' said state BJP spokesperson Sunil Sethi.\n\nOn the alliance with PDP, he said, \"The BJP in its agenda of alliance with PDP has committed that it will not alter any of the constitutional provisions. Abiding by coalition dharma, the BJP on its own will not do anything to alter any provision of the Constitution.\"\n\nProfessor Hari Om, a historian and social activist, said, \"It is an atrocious article that creates a high wall between people of J&K and the rest of India. It must be thrown out lock, stock and barrel.\"\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Article 35 A", "time": "00:56:00"}

The article was added to Article 370 in 1954 by a presidential decree.\n\nThe BJP, which is an alliance partner in the Mehbooba Mufti-led government in the state, has been calling for the scrapping of the special provision since the party's inception in 1980.\n\nA fresh debate over the continuation of the article has been generated after a Delhi-based NGO recently challenged its validity in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe NC said the BJP is using the people of Hindu-majority Jammu region of the state as a pawn in its national politics.\n\nAddressing media here, NC provincial president and Nagrota MLA Devender Singh Rana, a close confidant of party leader Omar Abdullah, equated the article with the holy cow that cannot be touched.\n\n\"It is a very serious and sensitive issue and we believe that if 35(A) is scrapped, it would be a grave injustice to the people of the state, especially Dogras of Jammu,\" he said\n\nRana said his party will reach out to the people in every district apprising them about the dangerous ramifications of abrogating the Article 35 (A).\n\nThe NC MLA said common people in villages, who do not know much about the article, too are against abrogation of the state-specific laws.\n\n\"It is a shield for the backward people of Jammu and Kashmir,\" he said.\n\nPointing out that the state is governed by Indian Constitution as well as the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, Rana said: \"We have been vested with certain rights and we will fight for their protection. Our cadre will go to each block to educate the people,\" he said.\n\nRana recalled how the erstwhile Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh issued notifications in 1927 and 1932 to check influx of outsiders, especially from Punjab, who had started settling down in the state for business and jobs.\n\nReferring to the petition filed in the Supreme Court challenging the Article 35(A), Rana said his party is of the view that the attorney general presented a very weak defence in the court.\n\n\"If 35 (A) is repealed then the Article 370 will also be weakened,\" said Rana.", "time": "13:57:00"}

This provision was enacted by a Presidential Order in 1954. Presidential Orders are issued with respect to the state of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, which is a temporary provision in the Constitution. The Presidential Order of 1954 was the most detailed of such orders and was issued to implement the agenda of the Delhi Agreement of 1952, which was signed between the Union of India and the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nRepresentational image. News18\n\nThis Presidential Order inter alia added Article 35A to the Constitution of India. It is pertinent to note that any addition or deletion of the provisions in a legal document, let alone the Constitution, amounts to amendment of that legal document. There is an established procedure mentioned in the Constitution by which an amendment can be carried out. This process outlined under Article 368, was circumvented during the addition of article 35A.\n\nThe process under Article 368 involves the Parliament and in certain cases, even the state legislatures, to carry out any amendment to the Constitution. However, Article 35A was inserted by an Order of the President, which means by the exclusive exercise of the executive's power. The Parliament was thereby totally alienated in the process.\n\nThe President of India exercised legislative power without informing the Parliament in this case. Under the scheme of our Constitution, the President is the head of the executive and has very little legislative role, except under Article 123. Therefore, the Presidential Order of 1954 is also a violation of Article 368 of the Constitution.\n\nThe blatant illegality in the process of enactment of Article 35A is for everyone to see. The provisions of Article 35A give special rights to the \"permanent residents\" of the state. It empowers the state legislature to define permanent residents and then give them special treatment, privileges and rights. This special treatment is with respect to 'employment with the state government, acquisition of immovable property in the state, settlement in the state, or right to scholarships and such other forms of aid as the state government may provide'.\n\nThe implementation of these provisions therefore leads to creation of two classes of citizens in the Union of India. One class has special access in Jammu and Kashmir and the other doesn't. This is something which goes against Article 14 of the Constitution, which says that the state shall not discriminate amongst its citizens on the basis of their gender, caste, creed, religion or the place of birth. It further says that the state cannot refuse equality before the law and equal protection of the laws to any person within the territory of India.\n\nIn other words, this means that no person or groups of people can demand for any special privileges. Most importantly, Article 14 refers to 'persons' and not 'citizens'. Therefore, it is not even necessary for a person to be a citizen of India to invoke the right under Article 14.\n\nThe Supreme Court has said on numerous occasions that the fundamental rights are the most sacrosanct part of our Constitution and can't be violated under any circumstances. Fundamental rights are also part of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution, which cannot be amended at all as the apex court has stated. The amendments to the Constitution cannot even be made through Article 368. Therefore, Article 35A is in direct violation of Article 14.\n\nThe Union government has rightly parted ways with the state government in front of the Supreme Court. The Centre expressed its reservations in responding to the NGO's petition before the apex court. This means that if Article 35A is struck down, there will be more legal parity between a citizen of India in Jammu and Kashmir and a citizen of India in any other state. Even from a political point, the existence of such special legal provisions for Jammu and Kashmir is indirectly an acknowledgment in front of the international community that the state is a disputed territory and therefore, it has a special status within the country.\n\nIt is high time that the Supreme Court takes cognisance of this matter. The enactment in the first place was nothing but political appeasement and opportunism, which was done in an extra constitutional manner through an illegal process. The NGO's petition is a welcome opportunity to declare Article 35A ultra vires.\n\nThe author teaches law at National Law University, Mumbai and is also a research fellow at Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Bombay\n\nPublished Date: Aug 12, 2017 12:48 pm | Updated Date: Aug 12, 2017 12:57 pm\n\nTags :#Article 35a#Article 368#Constitution#Fundamental rights#Inmyopinion#Jammu and kashmir#We the citizens", "time": "07:32:00"}

government offices and banks was badly affected by the strike.\n\nThe authorities also imposed curfew-like restrictions in five police station areas of downtown Srinagar to maintain law and order and foil protests.\n\nThe police and paramilitary CRPF personnel had placed barricades and concertina wires in the downtown areas to prevent youth from taking to roads and staging demonstrations.\n\nThe train services between Banihal and Baramulla in Valley was suspended by authorities as a precautionary measure in view of shutdown called by the separatists.\n\nThe separatist leaders Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Mohammad Yasin Malik had called for shutdown today to protest against \"attempts\" to abrogate Article 35-A of the constitution, which confers special rights and privileges on permanent residents of J&K and debars non-residents from buying land or property, getting a government job or voting in State Assembly elections.\n\nIn 2014, an NGO had filed a petition

The apex court had last month asked the Centre to file a reply within three weeks on the writ petition filed.\n\nThe traders under the banner of Kashmir Economic Alliance (KEA) staged a protest a city centre, here to protest against any attempt to abrogate Article 35-A.\n\n\"If Article 35-A is abrogated, Kashmir will witness 2016-like uprising again.

Saturday due to a separatist-sponsored shutdown to protest the alleged \"devious attempts\" being made at the behest of Sangh Parivar to abrogate Article 35A and Article 370 of the Constitution that grant special status to J&K.\n\nShops and other businesses and educational institutions remained closed and public transport stayed off the roads in Kashmir Valley and parts of Kishtwar and Doda districts of Jammu. Rail services in the Valley were also suspended.\n\nThe Kashmir University and J&K Board of School Education deferred the examinations scheduled for Saturday. There was heavy presence of police, the CRPF and other central paramilitary forces in Srinagar and other cities. Separatist leaders were placed under house arrest.\n\nAuthorities imposed restrictions on movement of people in five police station areas of Maharajgunj, Nowhatta, Khanyar, Nowhatta and Rainawari, apprehending violent protests.\n\nThe call for the one-day strike was issued by an alliance of key separatist leaders -- Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik -- against the \"Sangh Parivar-backed devious attempts\" to fiddle with the special status of J&K.\n\n\"These attempts are aimed at changing the demography of the state and dilute its Muslim-majority character,\" it alleged. Various other like-minded political, social and religious organisations, besides lawyers' associations, had endorsed the shutdown call.\n\nChief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Friday claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured her that there would be no fiddling with the special status of the state. On Saturday, the Opposition National Conference (NC) said that it did not believe Ms Mufti's public utterances.\n\nThe party accused her of being hand-in-glove with the BJP and other affiliates of the RSS in \"concerted efforts\" aimed at striking down Article 35A and Article 370.\n\n\"Post Ms Mufti's meeting with the Prime Minister, senior BJP functionaries have made it abundantly clear that they will continue to actively seek ways and means to strike down Article 35A. This has yet again exposed Ms Mufti and her party,\" said NC general secretary Ali Muhammad Sagar.\n\nBJP's spokesperson Virendra Gupta had on Friday said in Jammu, \"Time has come to bid a farewell to Article 370 and Article 35A as these have created separatist psyche in Jammu and Kashmir.\"", "time": "20:44:00"}

Practically, it is BJP ruling the IOK with a rubber stamp Chief Minister from PDP. The agenda of BJP Government in New Delhi has been to do away with the Article 370 of Indian Constitution, which gives special status to IOK. However, owing to non-availability of requisite numbers of MLAs to support a constitutional amendment to repeal Article 370, BJP has resorted to dilute another constitutional provision with respect to IOK. This constitutional provision is 35A of the Indian constitution. This article supplements Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. Article 35A allows the Jammu and Kashmir legislature 'to define the list of 'permanent residents' of the state, who are eligible to vote, work for the state government and own land.'\n\nAfter having deliberations on this article, the BJP led Indian Government has adopted an indirect strategy through a New Delhi based NGO to approach Indian Supreme Court for the dilution of this article. Prior to its dilution, New Delhi has initiated a debate among the masses, academia, think-tanks and official circle for the dilution or otherwise of Article 35 A. On its part, Indian Supreme Court has constituted a three-judge Bench, to complete a hearing over the matter in six weeks. This Bench of Indian SC has been constituted on the request of Indian Attorney General, which clearly speaks of the motives of Indian Government. It is to be noted that, repealing Article 370 and doing away with the special status of IOK was an election manifesto of Modi's BJP and is being implemented through a gradual process.\n\nThere has been a serious reaction from PDP and National Conference, the political parties of IOK over this Indian manipulation. Omar Abdullah, the former Chief Minister and leader of National Conference said, \"If there is debate on (the legality) of the Article, you will have to debate the accession itself,\" because the state's accession to the Indian Union and its special status are \"two sides of the same coin.\" Indeed, \"Like Article 370, Article 35A was negotiated between the princely state of J&K and the government of India and it is the bedrock of accession.\" In fact, Article 370 provides the only linkage between India and IOK. If Article 370 is repealed, IOK will be constitutionally free of Indian yoke. On her part, the incumbent Chief Minister of IOK, Ms. Mehbooba Mufti, has criticized the efforts for diluting Article 35A and said, \"Who is doing it? Why are they doing it? (challenging the Article 35A). Let me tell you that my party and other parties who carry the national flag there (in Jammu and Kashmir) despite all risks... I have no doubt in saying that there will be no one to hold it (if the article is diluted).\"\n\nNew Delhi, particularly the ruling BJP and its militant wing, RSS feel that, special status of IOK is, \"not a sacred cow that cannot be touched\". In their opinion, 'Both Articles 35A and 370 (granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir) were meant to be temporary.' This speaks of an Indian mindset, which can be linked and interpreted from the wording of first Indian Law Minister, Dr. Ambedkar, the founder of Indian constitution, who unequivocally opposed the incorporation of Article 370 in Indian Constitution. Article 370 was a secret deal between Sheikh Abdullah, and first Indian Premier, Nehru and 35A was incorporated later, again to satisfy the Kashmiris. In response to Article 370, Dr Ambedkar, said to Sheikh Abdullah in 1949, \"You wish India should protect your borders, she should build roads in your area, she should supply you food grains, and Kashmir should get equal status as India. But Government of India should have only limited powers and Indian people should have no rights in Kashmir. To give consent to this proposal, would be a treacherous thing against the interests of India and I, as the Law Minister of India, will never do it.\" Dr Ambedkar boycotted the Indian Assembly session at the time of passage of Article 370.\n\nThere is a basic contradiction between what India proclaims and what Indian Constitution merits. Since mid-1950s, successive Indian leadership has been claiming IOK, as an integral part of Indian Union, despite it is being ruled through Article 370 of its Constitution. This (Article 370) is drafted in part XXI of the Indian Constitution and clearly relates to the \"Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions\" concerning Kashmir. Indian integral states and provinces are not being ruled through this article, which clearly states that, Kashmir is not part of India and calling it as its integral part is part of ill motive of successive Indian governments. Though a fake document, even then, the so-called Instrument of Accession also specified only three subjects for accession: foreign affairs, defence and communications. Furthermore, it provides a number of safeguards to the state's sovereignty. Clause 7 states, \"Nothing in this instrument shall be deemed to commit me in any way to acceptance of any future constitution of India ...\" And \"after the restoration of law and order in the State of Jammu and Kashmir and the expulsion of the raiders, its future will be decided in accordance with the wishes of the people of the State.\"\n\nIndian claim over the state of Jammu and Kashmir is completely illegitimate and unsubstantiated. India is negating its own constitution and commitment with Kashmiris, UN, Pakistan and world community. Indian leadership should realize this and adopt a realistic approach for the solution of this outstanding issue, rather endeavouring to dilute Article 35A and abrogate Article 370 of its constitution. Kashmiris want freedom from India, therefore, any move like dilution of Article 35A and doing away with the special status of IOK would give further impetus to the freedom movement of Kashmiris in IOK.\n\n-- The writer, Professor of Politics and International Relations, is based in Islamabad.\n\nEmail: [email protected]", "time": "23:18:00"}

'deliberate fear psychosis'\n\nThe Kashmir and Chenab Valleys on Saturday observed a shutdown over the issue of Article 35A. Meanwhile, regional parties, including the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP), pushed for a consensus against any revocation, while the BJP decried \"deliberate fear psychosis\".\n\nAuthorities set up barricades in parts of Srinagar to keep protesters at bay in the wake of the separatists' call for a shutdown. However, traders associated with the Kashmir Economic Alliance (KEA) held a demonstration at Lal Chowk.\n\nNormal life hit\n\nThe shutdown affected normal life as schools, offices and petrol pumps remained closed. There was thin traffic on the roads. Train services were also suspended.\n\nIn Jammu region's Chenab Valley, the bandh call was issued by Anjuman Islamia Bhadarwah, Markazi Seerat Committee Doda, Anjuman Islamia Gandoh, Masjid Committee Thathri and Majlis-e-Shoura Kishtwar against the \"dilution of J&K's special status\".\n\nKashmir is witnessing a political storm following the Attorney-General's suggestion to the Supreme Court in July \"to have a larger debate on Article 35A\" while it is being challenged by an NGO. The Article defines exclusive rights of locals in J&K over jobs, immovable property and scholarships.\n\nAfter meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, CM Mehbooba Mufti also met the BJP's national general secretary Ram Madhav as \"part of consensus building against any erosion of special status\", as per the agenda of the alliance. However, National Conference (NC) leader Ali Muhammad Sagar alleged that \"Ms. Mufti's wishy-washy claim of getting an alleged assurance from the PM stood exposed as senior BJP leaders talk of no change in total and complete opposition to Article 35A and Article 370\". The NC's provincial president claimed that \"Jammu Dogras would be the main sufferers if Article 35A is scrapped\".\n\n\"Jammu people should be given a chance to hold a referendum on whether Article 35A should stay or go,\" said Mr. Rana, while describing Pakistan statement over the issue \"a ploy.\"\n\nHowever, BJP state spokesperson Anil Gupta accused the NC of \"creating a fear psychosis.\"\n\n\"NC's statement clearly indicates the mindset of his party that has always advocated politics of exclusion,\" said Mr. Gupta.", "time": "16:40:00"}

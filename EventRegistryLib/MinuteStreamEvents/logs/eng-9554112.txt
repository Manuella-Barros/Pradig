Danny Huston, perhaps best known for his villainous role in Yellowstone, is the latest actor to board the highly-anticipated comedy film.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Huston has signed on to star alongside Liam Neeson, Pamela Anderson, Paul Walter Hauser, and Kevin Durand in the untitled Naked Gun reboot. At this time, Huston's role remains under wraps. So far, Paramount has only revealed who Neeson and Hauser will be playing, with Neeson stepping into the role of Detective Frank Drebin and Hauser cast as his partner Ed. However, it is understood that Durand -- who can be seen this summer as Proximus Caesar in Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes -- will be taking on one of the movie's villain roles.\n\nRelated Original Naked Gun Director 'Not Excited' for Liam Neeson's Reboot, Jokes About OJ The Naked Gun helmer David Zucker explains why he's leery about the upcoming reboot and jokes about OJ Simpson's involvement. Close\n\nWhat Is Danny Huston Known For?\n\nHuston has acted since 1975 but didn't achieve worldwide recognition until the 2010s, when he began appearing in blockbuster movies like Clash of the Titans (2010), Robin Hood (2010), Wonder Woman (2017), Game Night (2018), and Angel Has Fallen (2019). However, one of his more iconic roles has been billionaire land developer Dan Jenkins in the hit Paramount Network drama series, Yellowstone. He was a main cast member on the show for its first two seasons, appearing in 17 episodes. Other television acting credits include American Horror Story, Magic City, and Succession.\n\nHuston will next be seen in Viggo Mortensen's Western The Dead Don't Hurt, which opens in theaters on May 31. Other upcoming projects for the actor include Kevin Costner's Civil War epic Horizon: An American Saga and Lionsgate's The Crow reboot starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd.\n\nRelated Liam Neeson Is 'Nervous' About Playing Frank Drebin in Naked Gun Reboot Liam Neeson confirms his casting as Frank Drebin and shares why he's nervous to star in the Naked Gun reboot.\n\nThe Naked Gun Reboot Is Finally Moving Forward\n\nThe Naked Gun franchise began in 1988 with the release of The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! The film series, which served as a continuation of the short-lived 1982 television series Police Squad!, starred Leslie Nielsen as Detective Frank Drebin. The first film was both a critical and commercial success upon release, leading to two sequels -- 1991's Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear and 1994's Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult.\n\nA reboot has been in various stages of development since 2013. However, there was not much progress on the Naked Gun reboot until 2021, when Seth MacFarlane joined the project as a producer. Akiva Schaffer (Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers) and Neeson boarded the reboot in October 2022 as director and lead actor, respectively. Dan Gregor and Doug Mand wrote the draft script along with Schaffer.\n\nProduction on Naked Gun was expected to begin last summer, according to Neeson in a January 2023 interview, but was likely pushed back due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. With casting now underway and a 2025 release date set, Naked Gun is scheduled to begin filming this month in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe untitled Naked Gun reboot is set to hit theaters on July 18, 2025.\n\nSource: Deadline\n\nThe Naked Gun Created by Jim Abrahams , David Zucker , Jerry Zucker First Film The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad Latest Film Naked Gun 33+1/3: The Final Insult Upcoming Films Naked Gun Reboot First TV Show Police Squad!

SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe Naked Gun reboot, starring Liam Neeson, has added a Yellowstone alum to the project. A planned reboot of the successful 1988 Leslie Nielsen movie The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! has been in the works for around a decade. In 2022, the project was officially greenlit with Neeson in the lead role. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane will co-write and co-produce the movie, with Hot Rod director Akiva Schaffer at the helm.\n\nAccording to reports from Deadline, American Horror Story alumnus Danny Huston is the latest name to be added to the cast of the Naked Gun reboot. Details of his role remain under wraps. He will join Neeson, Baywatch's Pamela Anderson, Emmy-winning Blackbird star Paul Walter Hauser, and Abigail actor Kevin Durand.\n\nHere is the confirmed cast list for The Naked Gun reboot movie so far:\n\nActor\n\nRole\n\nLiam Neeson\n\nFrank Drebin Jr.\n\nPaul Walter Hauser\n\nCapt. Ed Hocken\n\nPamela Anderson\n\nUnknown\n\nKevin Durand\n\nUnknown\n\nDanny Huston\n\nUnknown\n\nWhat Makes Huston A Great Casting Choice For The Naked Gun Reboot? Huston Has Experience In Both Dramatic & Comedic Roles.\n\nKnown for his gravitas, larger-than-life performances, and antagonist roles, Huston would be a great choice for the movie's principal villain.\n\nHuston might seem an unusual casting choice for a comedy like The Naked Gun, but he is still a great addition to the reboot. Though he is more recognized for his dramatic roles, he has some comedy experience, such as How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, Game Night, and Succession. Furthermore, he collaborated with Neeson in 2022's Marlowe, which will help their on-screen chemistry.\n\nIt is unknown who Huston will be playing in the reboot, but he may be a foil to Neeson's Frank Drebin Jr. character. Known for his gravitas, larger-than-life performances, and antagonist roles, Huston would be a great choice for the movie's principal villain. This is evident from Huston's time as the villain Dan Jenkins, a Yellowstone character who wanted to ruin the Dutton family. Furthermore, when casting was announced for Durand, it was reported that he was playing one of the movie's villains. This implies that there could be multiple adversaries that Neeson's character could face, increasing the likelihood that Huston is portraying an antagonist.\n\nMeanwhile, Huston will co-star in The Crow remake alongside Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd and reunite with Yellowstone's Kevin Costner in the civil war epic Horizon: An American Saga. Further details about his role in The Naked Gun should come in due course, with the project currently in pre-production, and due for a 2025 theatrical release.\n\nSource: Deadline\n\nThe Naked Gun Reboot Not Yet RatedActionComedySatire\n\nThe Naked Gun is set for a reboot via writer-director Akiva Schaffer, with Liam Neeson starring in the lead role.

Neeson is set to revive the beloved character of Detective Frank Drebin, originally immortalized by Leslie Nielsen. Hauser will join as Drebin's partner, Ed. Durand, meanwhile, is rumored to portray one of the film's antagonists. The original Naked Gun film emerged from the 1982 television series Police Squad! and debuted in 1988, quickly becoming a favorite for its slapstick humor and parody style. Despite the series concluding in 1994, its cultural impact has endured, leading to the current reboot efforts.\n\nInitial developments for the reboot began as early as 2013, but the project truly gained momentum in 2021 with Seth MacFarlane joining as a producer and Akiva Schaffer signing on as director. The script, penned by Dan Gregor and Doug Mand with Schaffer, promises to revive the franchise's classic comedic style. Despite some delays attributed to the SAG-AFTRA strike, production is now scheduled to commence in Atlanta, Georgia, with a planned release date of July 18, 2025.\n\nWhat Is Danny Huston Best Known For?\n\nHuston has been a dynamic presence in Hollywood since his debut in 1975. Despite a gradual start, he gained significant recognition in the 2010s with roles in high-profile films such as Clash of the Titans (2010), Robin Hood (2010), and Wonder Woman (2017). On television, Huston shined as billionaire Dan Jenkins in the hit series Yellowstone, marking one of his most notable roles to date. His other television credits include American Horror Story and Succession.\n\nFans can look forward to Huston's upcoming appearances in Viggo Mortensen's Western The Dead Don't Hurt, and other projects like Kevin Costner's Horizon: An American Saga and The Crow reboot starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd. With its blend of new and familiar faces, the Naked Gun reboot is set to offer a fresh take on the beloved series, aiming to captivate both long-time fans and new audiences with its timeless humor and slapstick nonsense.\n\nStay tuned to Collider for more updates on The Naked Gun.", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Student Loan Bill enables vulnerable Nigerian students, the less privileged to obtain higher education.\n\n\"And as I speak to you now, over 30,000 Nigerian students have already been selected to benefit from that scheme. That is one of the bills I will say appealed to me the most.\"\n\nSaharaReporters earlier reported that President Tinubu signed the Student Loans (Access to Higher Education) Act (Repeal and Re-Enactment) Bill, 2024, into law.\n\nSaharaReporters reported on March 20 that the Nigerian Senate had passed the Student Loans (Access to Higher Education) Act (Repeal and Re-Enactment) Bill, 2024, after separate considerations by both the Senate and the House of Representatives of the report of the Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFund.\n\nThe report on the bill was tendered before the federal lawmakers by the committee's chairman, Senator Muntari Dandutse (All Progressives Congress - Katsina South).\n\nThe bill was introduced to the Senate by President Bola Tinubu for consideration and passage last week.\n\nThe Senate hurried the bill's hearing by suspending relevant elements of its standing rules and referring it to the Committee of the whole for consideration.\n\nFollowing a debate on the bill, Senate President Godswill Akpabio sent it to the Senate Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND for further legislative action, with a one-week report deadline.\n\nThe bill proposes to offer poor Nigerians access to higher education through interest-free loans from the Nigerian Education Loan Fund, which was established by the Act to ensure education for all Nigerians.\n\nMany concerned citizens and civil organisations have criticised this policy, saying the loan would not improve access to tertiary education in the country as advocated by the government.\n\nFor instance, the Education Rights Campaign (ERC) has described it as a smokescreen to take education out of the reach of the poor.\n\nThe group asserted that the scheme had not worked anywhere else, noting that it would transform public education into a business and students into customers.\n\nIt later stated that the postponement of the student loan policy by the government showed that the policy was not designed for the interests of indigent students in the country.\n\nThe ERC noted this in a recent press statement jointly signed by Hassan Taiwo Soweto, National Coordinator and Michael Lenin, its National Mobilisation Officer.\n\nThe group said that the programme was a packaged fraud by the Tinubu government to deceive Nigerians into continuing to raise tuition for public colleges, making education more expensive for common residents.", "source": {"uri": "saharareporters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sahara Reporters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

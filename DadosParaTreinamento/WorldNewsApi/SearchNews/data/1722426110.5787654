Police said officers responded after 4:47 a.m. to a reported collision on Mamalahoa Highway (Highway 190), north of the 23-mile marker. An investigation found that a southbound green 2015 Subaru Forester, driven by a 40-year-old Hilo woman, crossed the double solid yellow line and collided head-on with a northbound silver 2000 Acura Integra sedan, driven by a man, who was later identified as Alvin Godfrey Castro III. Castro was transported to the North Hawaii Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:25 a.m., according to a police report.

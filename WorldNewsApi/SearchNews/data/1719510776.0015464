{"id": 223688374, "title": "How this Pune artist created a magic table with sand, internet and invisible parts", "text": "Pune-based artist Sagar Agawane was creating works based on graphic design until, 15 years ago, he turned his interest to technology. During the Covid years, Agawane tried his hand at building a product that would showcase art as well as technology. This was how the lifestyle furniture startup LUNOoOM was born last year, the name blending the word Luno meaning moon and the Indian sound of Om. From the electronics to the machine parts to the outer body, entire products are indigenous and made in Kothrud. The startup manufactures lifestyle furniture with a unique technology and is now winning international recognition. LUNOoOM has won the \u201cBest Upcoming Innovative Concept of The Year-Furniture\u201d award at the Entrepreneur India Startup Awards 2024 and the Innovation Award at the World Furniture Expo. \u201cIt was not a new concept. I went back to what was in our culture and tradition. We draw rangoli and, even 10-20 years ago, this was made in every house every day. Nowadays, everyone has become too busy but the tradition has some value. That is what we thought we should create using technology,\u201d says Agawane, who dipped into his savings to create the startup. LUNOoOM's earliest product was a centre table whose features include a sand art-based surface and embedded technology that is invisible. \u201cThis is an IoT (internet of things) table that is connected to Wi-Fi. We can operate it through an application that is present on android and iOS. We can manage the lights on the table. There are static lights as well as themed lights like rainbow and the tricolour that we can change according to the ambience,\u201d says Agawane. The table can also play music and a user can choose the design it will display on the surface that day. \u201cWe have used multiple technologies on the table, from electronic to mechanical to robotic technology. The app has more than 200 patterns for the sand art. Inside the sand, there is a ball that is magnetically controlled. So, whatever design you play, the ball will create that design in the sand,\u201d he adds.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-artist-created-magic-table-with-sand-internet-and-invisible-parts-9353008/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/pune-artist.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:33:59", "author": "Dipanita Nath", "authors": ["Dipanita Nath"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.258}

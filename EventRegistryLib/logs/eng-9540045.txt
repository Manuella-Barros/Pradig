The Community Security Initiative, which coordinates security for Jewish institutions in the New York City area, said at the time that the threats were made as part of a campaign intended to interrupt synagogue operations by forcing law enforcement to go to a location, and there did not appear to be any actual danger to the targets.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams last month directed the New York Police Department to beef up security around Jewish institutions in the city in the wake of the Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel.\n\nAdams stressed at the time that there is no direct threat to Jewish institutions in New York City at the time and the decision to increase security was made as a precaution.", "source": {"uri": "israelnationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel

Investigators swiftly determined these emails were not credible, yet that did not dissuade the anger and fear around the communities.\n\nThe threats coincided with national commemorations of Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, a prayerful Jewish holy day in memory of the six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust.\n\nThe Brooklyn Heights Synagogue. which received one of the threatening emails, said officers from the 84th Precinct conducted a search of the building; three workers inside the location at the time were evacuated out of an abundance of caution.\n\n\"Sadly, mass email threats to Jewish institutions known as 'swatting' have increased throughout the country, and yesterday's non-credible threat was part of an ongoing, broader effort to instill fear and create havoc,\" a statement released by the Brooklyn Heights Synagogue read.\n\nHours after the bomb threats, U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer (D-New York) and Congress Member Jerry Nadler (D-Manhattan) announced $400 million in new federal funds to bolster security at synagogues, mosques, churches and other houses of worship.\n\nSchumer, the Senate majority leader, said the May 4 bomb threats underscored the need for greater federal funding to combat antisemitism and violence.\n\n\"Last night's bomb threats targeting New York City synagogues created immense fear, but sadly, these threats are not a total shock given the rise in antisemitism that we have seen and the overall spike in threats to places of worship,\" Schumer said. \"Amid these threats, especially those seen across the city and Long Island, we have just strengthened the federal program known as the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) so that we can boost security where it might be lacking. In the recent National Security Supplemental I just passed, I included an additional $400 million for this critical program because amid rising threats we need buttoned up security and amid the cascade of rising antisemitism, we need robust federal funds at the ready.\"\n\nDubbed the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, the initiative helps institutions pay for more security staff and measures in order to keep them safe and secure.

Kathy Hochul. (Barry Williams/New York Daily News/TNS)\n\nThree New York City synagogues and The Brooklyn Museum were hit with bogus bomb threats over a roughly two-hour span -- and the threats are believed to be part of a mass email sent to nearly two dozen Jewish houses of worship, according to a Jewish philanthropic organization.\n\nThe emailed threats, all determined to be unfounded, drew the attention of Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said on Twitter.com Saturday night her office was \"actively monitoring\" them.\n\nThe first threat came at about 3:15 p.m., to Congregation Rodeph Sholom at 7 W. 83rd St., according to both police and the congregation's leadership.\n\nPolice called for an evacuation, and after a search found no explosives.\n\n\"Sadly, threats to Jewish institutions across the country have increased and this afternoon's threat was part of an ongoing, broader effort,\" the synagogue posted on its Facebook page.\n\nJust before 4:30 p.m., cops say someone sent an email to Congregation Beit Simchat Torah at 130 W. 30th St. -- known for its progressive and openly LGBTQ congregation. No one was inside the building at the time, and cops found no explosives, police said.\n\nAbout 45 minutes after that, the Brooklyn Heights Synagogue at 131 Remsen St. received a similar threat, leading three employees to clear out, cops said. That threat, too, was unfounded.\n\nFinally, just before 5:30 p.m., someone sent an email to the Brooklyn Museum at 200 Eastern Parkway, claiming explosives had been planted on the No. 2 and 3 subway lines, cops said. Police found no explosives.\n\nCops have not said whether the threats are linked.\n\nA security bulletin obtained by the New York Daily News said the synagogue threats were all the work of a single person who sent out a mass email to 14 Jewish houses of worship in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, five in Queens, one on Long Island, one in upstate Utica, and one in Iowa.\n\n\"Hello, if you see this email just have notice of a bomb I have set inside of your building,\" the email reads, according to the bulletin by the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of New York's Community Security Initiative, which is run by former NYPD director of intelligence Mitch Silber.\n\n\"This isn't a threat I have set a bomb in your building, you have a few hours to disarm or else blood will shatter everywhere,\" the email continues. \"The group 'Terrorizers111' is behind this.\"\n\nThe threats come as tensions and college campus protests roil the city after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing almost 1,200 and sparking a sustained Israeli siege in Gaza that has killed roughly 35,000.\n\n\"We are actively monitoring a number of bomb threats at synagogues in New York,\" Hochul said in her statement. \"Threats have been determined not to be credible, but we will not tolerate individuals sowing fear &antisemitism. Those responsible must be held accountable for their despicable actions.\"\n\nAs the conflict continues, antisemitic hate crimes have jumped by 45% citywide, according to NYPD stats.", "source":

Full stop,\" he said.\n\nTreyger added that such threats are \"not isolated from the bigger, hostile climate right now against Jewish people.\"\n\nAnd while he thanked law enforcement and local and state officials for monitoring the situation and communicating with the Jewish community, he said the amount of security they have needed to practice their faith in a safer way is \"not normal.\"\n\n\"We cannot normalize that in New York City in the year 2024 ... we will never accept this as normal in New York, in the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nNew York City Police Department data obtained by the Post showed a 45 percent increase in antisemitic hate crimes in 2024. NYPD recorded 96 anti-Jewish incidents across the city, compared to 66 in the same time period in 2023.\n\n\"The troubling numbers account for antisemitic crimes occurring from Jan. 1 through April 14 -- months after Hamas' surprise attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023,\" according to the report.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We are grateful for the response from the NYPD, who, in partnership with our professional security team, completed a thorough investigation of the situation.\"\n\nCBS News also reports that that the Brooklyn Museum received an email threatening to blow up the nearby Eastern Parkway/Brooklyn Museum subway station. The MTA said an \"unusual package\" was found outside the station, but subway service was not affected.\n\nOn X, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine called the threats \"a clear effort to sow fear in the Jewish community,\" as well as a hate crime that's \"part of a growing trend of 'swatting' incidents targeting Jewish institutions.\"\n\nGov.

You have a few hours to disarm, or else blood will shatter everywhere.\"\n\n\"I have talked about this for a long time with my community,\" said Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum of Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, one of the synagogues addressed in the email. \"We plan for all this. We have protocols in place and we have increased security. We always need to be well prepared.\"\n\nAn LGBTQ+-affirming synagogue, Beit Simchat Torah has faced similar bomb scares before, but since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, many Jewish congregations, no matter their views on the war, have dealt with the threat of antisemitic attacks.\n\n\"I think there's tremendous anxiety and fear and concern about the world in which we live,\" said Kleinbaum. \"As the LGBT synagogue, we experience the world from a place of knowing there's a lot of hate. But we always have a choice. Do we focus on that hate? Or do we focus on love?\"\n\nKleinbaum's Midtown Manhattan congregation was holding its annual retreat away from the building that was threatened, but two other synagogues, Congregation Rodeph Sholom on the Upper West Side and the Brooklyn Heights Synagogue, were evacuated as a precaution.\n\nAnd later, the New York Police Department swept the synagogues and found the threats to be unfounded.\n\n\"Threats have been determined not to be credible, but we will not tolerate individuals sowing fear & antisemitism,\" tweeted New York Governor Kathy Hochul. \"Those responsible must be held accountable for their despicable actions.\"\n\nAn FBI investigation into the source of the email, calling itself \"Terrorizer 111,\" is underway.\n\nAccording to recent NYPD data, anti-Jewish hate crimes have jumped by 45% this year, fueled by the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the resulting tensions among Americans with ties to Palestine and Israel. Between Oct. 7, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel, and March 31 of 2024, there have been 241 confirmed incidents of antisemitism, including vandalism, robbery and felony assault.\n\nIn the wake of the weekend's false bomb threats, Senate Majority leader announced on Sunday (May 5) a $400 million increase in federal funds available for security in houses of worship. In his announcement, he added that bomb threats in New York are the highest in the country.\n\n\"The second I heard about the threats, your heart sinks, you hope it's a hoax. And in this case, thank God, it was,\" he said. \"But that doesn't (negate) the fear, the trauma when synagogues and other houses of worship have to be evacuated. The fear and trauma when they have to be evacuated stays with the congregants, and people who go the next day wonder, 'Is it going to happen again, am I safe?'\"\n\nThe existing Non Profit Security Grant Program, which offered $305 million to accepted nonprofits last year, is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The increase announced by Schumer will provide more money for \"both security personnel to guard their institutions as well as cameras, fencing, windows that would resist any kind of attack,\" said the majority leader.\n\nHouses of worship must apply by May 21 to tap into the first round of funds. FEMA said it will assist smaller houses of worship with grant writing.\n\n\"This is a persistent cascade of intolerance and even violence, and the state of hate has become a boiling point in America, and it demands a much stronger response,\" Schumer said. \"We're going to keep funding so that no synagogue or other religious institution is going to have to live in the fear that they now live with.\"\n\nState Assemblyman Alex Bores, whose Upper East Side district is home to four of the synagogues threatened on Saturday, calls the attacks on Shabbat \"deeply unsettling.\" Bores, notified of the threats by several sources, worked with NYPD to respond quickly, as \"a bomb threat is not something you make assumptions about.\"\n\n\"The first promise of government is to keep everyone safe,\" Bores told Religion News Service. \"Something that we desperately need is to find ways to counteract hate, both, I would say, from encouraging more dialogue and helping to guide people to better views, but of course, also in providing hard security so that everyone can be safe.\"\n\nJust two weeks ago, he said, the state added $35 million to its own Securing Communities Against Hate grant program. Earlier in April, New York lawmakers introduced a bill that would expand the state's criteria for a hate crime to include trespassing in places of worship.\n\nAt Beit Simchat Torah, Kleinbaum said her congregation plans to look into the possibility of funding and that she has been \"very grateful to Senator Schumer for really thinking these things through.\"\n\nBut the rabbi said a more pressing goal is the \"deeper level of security,\" which will happen by \"building a world in which God's presence can exist without this kind of hate.\"\n\n\"I always say one of the best responses to antisemitism is to be more Jewish,\" she said. \"And that what ultimately will defeat those who hate us is for us to build more meaningful, more engaged Jewish lives and Jewish institutions.\"", "source": {"uri": "religionnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Religion News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richa_karmarkar@religionnews.com", "name": "Richa Karmarkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bomb threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Synagogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_Beit_Simchat_Torah", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Congregation Beit Simchat Torah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Kleinbaum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sharon Kleinbaum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Heights"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Heights"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midtown Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Midtown Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_West_Side", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper West Side"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Upper West Side"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Kathy Hochul, who said on Twitter.com Saturday night her office was \"actively monitoring\" them.\n\nThe first threat came at about 3:15 p.m., to Congregation Rodeph Sholom at 7 W. 83rd St., according to both police and the congregation's leadership.\n\nPolice called for an evacuation, and after a search found no explosives.\n\n\"Sadly, threats to Jewish institutions across the country have increased and this afternoon's threat was part of an ongoing, broader effort,\" the synagogue posted on its Facebook page.\n\nJust before 4:30 p.m., cops say someone sent an email to Congregation Beit Simchat Torah at 130 W. 30th St. -- known for its progressive and openly LGBTQ congregation.

That threat, too, was unfounded.\n\nFinally, just before 5:30 p.m., someone sent an email to the Brooklyn Museum at 200 Eastern Parkway, claiming explosives had been planted on the No. 2 and 3 subway lines, cops said. Police found no explosives.\n\nCops have not said whether the threats are linked.\n\nA security bulletin obtained by the New York Daily News said the synagogue threats were all the work of a single person who sent out a mass email to 14 Jewish houses of worship in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, five in Queens, one on Long Island, one in upstate Utica, and one in Iowa.\n\n\"Hello, if you see this email just have notice of a bomb I have set inside of your building,\" the email reads, according to the bulletin by the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of New York's Community Security Initiative, which is run by former NYPD director of intelligence Mitch Silber.\n\n\"This isn't a threat I have set a bomb in your building, you have a few hours to disarm or else blood will shatter everywhere,\" the email continues. \"The group 'Terrorizers111' is behind this.\"\n\nThe threats come as tensions and college campus protests roil the city after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing almost 1,200 and sparking a sustained Israeli siege in Gaza that has killed roughly 35,000.\n\n\"We are actively monitoring a number of bomb threats at synagogues in New York,\" Hochul said in her statement. \"Threats have been determined not to be credible, but we will not tolerate individuals sowing fear & antisemitism.

The New York Landmarks Conservancy received a similar threat.\n\nThe threats come at a time when there is increased antisemitism in the five boroughs and other places. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters have set up anti-Israeli encampments on college campuses across the US amid the Hamas-Israel conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, New York officials said the threats were unfounded. Investigators are now trying to trace who sent them.\n\nUS Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Jerry Nadler said at a press conference that they had spoken with the FBI about the investigation. \"I asked them to make every effort to track down who did this,\" Schumer said, according to CBS News. \"It's hard to do, because those who do it can often hide where their email is coming from, where their phone calls are coming from, in either case. But the FBI has had good success, it takes time, and they are able to track many of these bad people who do this kind of activity down and then go after them.\"\n\n\"The second I heard about the threats, your heart sinks, you hope it's a hoax. And in this case, thank God, it was,\" he said. \"But that doesn't [negate] the fear, the trauma when synagogues and other houses of worship have to be evacuated. The fear and trauma when they have to be evacuated stays with the congregants, and people who go the next day wonder, 'Is it going to happen again, am I safe?'\"\n\nIn a post on X, Governor Kathy Hochul wrote, \"We are actively monitoring a number of bomb threats at synagogues in New York.

The same was also received to temples in upstate New York and on Long Island. The email, received on Saturday, warned of a bomb inside the buildings.\n\n\"Hello, if you see this email just have notice of a bomb I have set inside of your building,\" the email sent Saturday read, law enforcement sources told The NY Post.\n\n\"This isn't a threat,\" it said. \"I have set a bomb in your building, you have a few hours to disarm or else blood will shatter everywhere.\" The NY Post Sources said the threat came from a group calling itself \"Terrorizers111.\"\n\nThe targets of the threat included 14 synagogues and Jewish centers in Manhattan, five in Queens, and two in Brooklyn. Additionally, two temples upstate and one on Long Island were targeted. The New York Landmarks Conservancy also received a similar threat.\n\nThese threats occur during a period of increased antisemitism in New York City and beyond. Pro-Palestinian protesters have been demonstrating in the streets and setting up anti-Israeli encampments on college campuses, including Columbia University and City College, in recent weeks.\n\nUS Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Sunday announced that $400 million in federal assistance would be earmarked to protect houses of worship by funding security guards, cameras and barriers.\n\n\"Last night's bomb threats targeting New York City synagogues created immense fear, but sadly, these threats are not a total shock given the rise in antisemitism that we have seen and the overall spike in threats to places of worship,\" Schumer said in a statement.\n\n\"Protecting our nonprofit community spaces, like our synagogues, mosques, churches and more has unfortunately demanded more help at the federal level as the threats have increased,\" he said. \"These funds are to help lessen the unease across the city in the places where we worship, pray, and learn.\"\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, there were 8,873 antisemitic incidents in the US last year, marking a 140% increase from the 2022 figure.\n\nThe number surged after October 7, following a deadly attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists, which prompted a significant retaliatory response from Israel in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAfter October 7, there were 5,204 recorded antisemitic incidents. The incidents in 2023 included 1,009 bomb threats against Jewish institutions, as reported by the ADL.\n\nThe NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Saturday's bomb threats.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Hochul, who said on Twitter.com Saturday night her office was \"actively monitoring\" them.\n\nThe first threat came at about 3:15 p.m., to Congregation Rodeph Sholom at 7 W. 83rd St., according to both police and the congregation's leadership.\n\nPolice called for an evacuation, and after a search found no explosives.\n\n\"Sadly, threats to Jewish institutions across the country have increased and this afternoon's threat was part of an ongoing, broader effort,\" the synagogue posted on its Facebook page.\n\nJust before 4:30 p.m., cops say someone sent an email to Congregation Beit Simchat Torah at 130 W. 30th St. -- known for its progressive and openly LGBTQ congregation. No one was inside the building at the time, and cops found no explosives, police said.\n\nAbout 45 minutes after that, the Brooklyn Heights Synagogue at 131 Remsen St. received a similar threat, leading three employees to clear out, cops said. That threat, too, was unfounded.\n\nFinally, just before 5:30 p.m., someone sent an email to the Brooklyn Museum at 200 Eastern Parkway, claiming explosives had been planted on the No. 2 and 3 subway lines, cops said. Police found no explosives.\n\nCops have not said whether the threats are linked.\n\nA security bulletin obtained by the Daily News said the synagogue threats were all the work of a single person who sent out a mass email to 14 Jewish houses of worship in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, five in Queens, one on Long Island, one in upstate Utica, and one in Iowa.\n\n\"Hello, if you see this email just have notice of a bomb I have set inside of your building,\" the email reads, according to the bulletin by the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of New York's Community Security Initiative, which is run by former NYPD director of intelligence Mitch Silber.\n\n\"This isn't a threat I have set a bomb in your building, you have a few hours to disarm or else blood will shatter everywhere,\" the email continues. \"The group 'Terrorizers111' is behind this.\"\n\nThe threats come as tensions and college campus protests roil the city after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing almost 1,200 and sparking a sustained Israeli siege in Gaza that has killed roughly 35,000.\n\n\"We are actively monitoring a number of bomb threats at synagogues in New York,\" Hochul said in her statement. \"Threats have been determined not to be credible, but we will not tolerate individuals sowing fear & antisemitism.

The selloff in global stock markets, oil, and high-yielding currencies persisted on Monday, leading investors to seek safer assets like cash, while U.S. Treasury yields continued to drop.Japan's yen hit mid-January highs against the dollar at Asia open on Monday, as markets extended moves triggered last week after weak U.S. labour data stoked recession worries and expectations of deeper rate cuts by the Fed.\n\nFriday's job data, coming on top of a string of weak earnings reports from large technology firms and heightened concerns over the Chinese economy, drove a global selloff in stock markets, oil and high-yielding currencies as investors sought the safety of cash.\n\nThe selling continued on Monday, with U.S. Treasury yields falling further, stock indexes in the red and currencies slightly less volatile but down against the dollar and yen.\n\nThe safe-haven and carry-funding favourite, the yen, was traded at 145.43 yen, up 0.8% versus the dollar, after hitting a mid-January peak of 145.28 in early deals.\n\nThe euro was flat at $1.091, the dollar index was nearly flat too at 103.17 while the Australian dollar fetched $0.6495 and was down 0.25%.\n\n\"The market pricing has a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed at its September meeting, which I think will be too much,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\"The U.S. economy is showing signs of slowdown but it's not as bad as the market is pricing in.\"\n\nBut near-term momentum could keep the selloff going, with technical levels also pointing to more yen gains, he said.\n\nTreasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last week, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its current 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened the possibility of a rate cut in September.\n\nBut by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate jumped, sparking chatter U.S. economy could be heading for a recession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries sank nearly 40 basis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March 2020, and were last at 3.79%.\n\nFed fund futures reflected traders pricing an over 70% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September meeting, according to CME FedWatch. Futures imply 155 basis points of cuts this year, with a similar amount in 2025.\n\nThe yen is up 10% against the dollar in just over 3 weeks, driven in part of the Bank of Japan's large 15 basis points rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it announced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the next couple of years.\n\nBarclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most overbought among G10 majors and therefore \"the bar for yet more outperformance in the near term appears high\".\n\nThe two-day rout in stock markets late last week saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite notch a 10% correction from a record high hit in early 2022. Equities plunged in Europe and Asia as well, with Japan's Nikkei index losing nearly 5% for the week.\n\nThe closely watched U.S. two-year-to-10-year yield curve narrowed its inversion, to minus 5.7 bps, the least inverted since July 2022, reflecting both recession fears and expectations for sharp easing of short-term yields.\n\nMeanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of military escalation in the Middle East after latest developments in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven oil prices to January lows.\n\nThe U.S. military is deploying more forces in the Middle East and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh two days ago in Tehran.", "source": {"uri":

This was the index's worst showing in percentage terms since the October 1987 crash.\n\nJapan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27% drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77.\n\nFrom July 11 to Monday's close of 31,458.42, Nikkei has wiped out 113 trillion yen ($792 billion) of that peak market value.\n\n\"The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade - investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly U.S. tech stocks,\" said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.\n\n\"We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.\"\n\nThe Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop in point terms, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct. 20, 1987 when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government was monitoring markets with \"grave concern\".\n\n\"It's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks,\" Suzuki told reporters.\n\nMost analysts said neither interest rate expectations nor economic data could explain the severity of the sell-off, although it was possibly driven by the rise in the yen whose near-zero short-term yields and steady depreciation had made it the funding currency for billions of dollars worth of investments for years.\n\nThe yen was last up 2.5% at 142.96 per dollar, and has risen 14% in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.\n\n\"In short, not only the currency but the entire 'value' trade in Japan which had hijacked our market for two years is being unwound,\" said Richard Kaye, a portfolio manager at Comgest in Tokyo.\n\nGLOBAL SELLOFF\n\nU.S. stocks sold off for a second straight session on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite index confirmed it was in correction territory after the jobs report stoked fears of a recession and expectations for a big Federal Reserve rate cut in September. [.N]\n\nU.S. stock futures were sharply lower in a sign Wall Street shares were set for a fresh selloff.\n\n\"I think the U.S. economic slowdown worries were too much, but the market did turn nervous after the Bank of Japan's rate hike as they thought the domestic economy is not strong enough to justify the rate hike,\" said Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\nThe banking sector slumped 17% to become the worst sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes.\n\nChip-equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell 18.48% and was the biggest drag on the Nikkei. Uniqlo brand owner Fast Retailing lost 9.59% and technology investor SoftBank Group sank 18.66%.\n\nThe broader Topix fell 12.2% to 2,227.15, its weakest since mid-October and also moved into bear territory as it clocked a 25% decline from its July 11 peak.\n\n($1 = 142.6200 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Junko Fujita, Ankur Banerjee and Rocky Swift; Writing by Vidya Ranganathan, Editing by Shri

resurgent yen and weak US jobs data that fuelled fears of a recession in the world's top economy.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index plunged 12.40 percent, or 4,451.28 points, to 31,458.42 -- its largest points drop in history -- while the broader Topix index lost 12.23 percent, or 310.45 points, to 2,227.15.\n\nThe yen surged to 141.73 against the dollar, a level not seen since early January, from 146.52 yen in New York on Friday.\n\nThe Japanese currency has rapidly appreciated from levels of near 162 in early July, its weakest value since 1986.\n\nA stronger yen is a negative factor for Japanese exporters and the recent rally has been fuelled by central bank policy decisions that have reversed the trends of recent years.\n\nThe Bank of Japan last week raised interest rates for the second time in 17 years, with talk of another rate hike to come, while the US Federal Reserve has hinted at a cut as soon as September.\n\nDaiwa Securities said the losses in Tokyo reflected \"deepening concerns over the uncertain US economy\".\n\n\"Investor sentiment was down as the US employment data for July came in lower than expected, raising fears that the US economy is slowing more than expected,\" IwaiCosmo Securities said.\n\n\"The market was also weighed down by the yen's appreciation against the dollar and as expectations for exporters' upbeat financial results receded,\" the brokerage added.\n\nOn Wall Street on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 1.5 percent as data showed the US jobs market cooled much more than expected in July.\n\nEuropean stock markets also closed sharply in the red.\n\nIn an attempt to calm volatility in the market, futures trading was suspended for 10 minutes as a so-called \"circuit-breaker\" on the Nikkei and Topix indexes on the Osaka Exchange in Japan's western metropolis, an exchange official said.\n\nSemiconductor shares plunged with Tokyo Electron nosediving 18.48 percent to 22,055 yen and Advantest tumbling 15.84 percent to 5,313 yen.\n\nToyota plummeted 13.65 percent to 2,232 yen.", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It rose as far as 142.20.\n\nThe Swiss franc, another popular funding currency, was up more than 1% at 0.8488 to the dollar.\n\nThe euro was up 0.2% $1.0937, the dollar index was down 0.4% at 102.72, while the Australian dollar fetched $0.6488 and was down 0.36%.\n\n\"The market pricing has a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed at its September meeting, which I think will be too much,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\"The U.S. economy is showing signs of slowdown, but it's not as bad as the market is pricing in.\"\n\nHowever, near-term momentum could keep the sell-off going, with technical levels also pointing to more yen gains, he said.\n\nTreasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last week, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its current 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened the possibility of a rate cut in September.\n\nBut by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate jumped, sparking chatter the U.S. economy could be heading for a recession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries sank nearly 40 basis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March 2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n\nFed fund futures reflected traders pricing a more than 80% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September meeting, according to CME FedWatch. Futures imply 155 basis points of cuts this year, with a similar amount in 2025.\n\nThe yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past three weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's large 15 basis points rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it announced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the next couple of years.\n\nBarclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most overbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more outperformance in the near term appears high\".\n\nThe two-day rout in stock markets late last week saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite notch a 10% correction from a record high hit in early 2022. Equities plunged in Europe and Asia as well, with Japan's Nikkei index losing 24% over three days, putting it in bear market territory.\n\nThe closely watched U.S. two-year-to-10-year yield curve narrowed its inversion. It was the least inverted since July 2022 late last week, reflecting both recession fears and expectations for a sharp easing of short-term yields.\n\nMeanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of military escalation in the Middle East after latest developments in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven oil prices to their lowest since January.\n\nThe U.S. military is deploying more forces in the Middle East and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh two days ago in Tehran.\n\n(Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Christopher Cushing)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This was the index's worst showing in percentage terms since the October 1987 crash.\n\nJapan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27% drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77.\n\nFrom July 11 to Monday's close of 31,458.42, Nikkei has wiped out 113 trillion yen ($792 billion) of that peak market value.\n\n\"The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade - investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly U.S. tech stocks,\" said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.\n\n\"We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.\"\n\nThe Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop in point terms, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct. 20, 1987 when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government was monitoring markets with \"grave concern\".\n\n\"It's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks,\" Suzuki told reporters.\n\nMost analysts said neither interest rate expectations nor economic data could explain the severity of the sell-off, although it was possibly driven by the rise in the yen whose near-zero short-term yields and steady depreciation had made it the funding currency for billions of dollars worth of investments for years.\n\nThe yen was last up 2.5% at 142.96 per dollar, and has risen 14% in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.\n\n\"In short, not only the currency but the entire 'value' trade in Japan which had hijacked our market for two years is being unwound,\" said Richard Kaye, a portfolio manager at Comgest in Tokyo.\n\nGLOBAL SELLOFF\n\nU.S. stocks sold off for a second straight session on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite index confirmed it was in correction territory after the jobs report stoked fears of a recession and expectations for a big Federal Reserve rate cut in September. [.N]\n\nU.S. stock futures were sharply lower in a sign Wall Street shares were set for a fresh selloff.\n\n\"I think the U.S. economic slowdown worries were too much, but the market did turn nervous after the Bank of Japan's rate hike as they thought the domestic economy is not strong enough to justify the rate hike,\" said Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\nThe banking sector slumped 17% to become the worst sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes.\n\nChip-equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell 18.48% and was the biggest drag on the Nikkei.

The franc, a traditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high.\n\nHigh-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee and Mexican peso tumbled, while currencies that had hitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and China's yuan, rallied.\n\nTreasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last week, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its current 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent range while Chair Jerome Powell opened the possibility of a rate cut in September.\n\nBut by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had jumped, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n\nJapanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single day rout since the 1987 Black Monday sell-offs.\n\nThe euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.0944 against a broadly-weaker dollar.\n\nExpectations for European Central Bank (ECB) rate cuts have also risen. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of rate cut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps a week ago.\n\n\"This is a position unwind and since the National Assembly election was called in France, no one's been long euros,\" Kit Juckes, head of FX Strategy at Societe Generale said, referring to the euro's slide in June after a snap election was called in France.\n\n\"The euro will be capped by

Once it reverses, you got to get out right and I think they're all getting out right now as a result of that,\" Tay said.\n\nThe yen, which weakened to a 38-year low of 161.99 against the U.S. dollar in June, reversed course during the run-up to the Bank of Japan's policy meeting.\n\nIt strengthened sharply after the BOJ raised its benchmark interest rate last week to around 0.25% and decided to trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds.\n\nCurrently, the yen was last trading at 144.82, its lowest level against the greenback since January. A stronger yen pressurizes Japanese stock markets, which are heavily dominated by trading houses and export-oriented firms by eroding their competitiveness.\n\nBOJ governor Kazuo Ueda had struck a hawkish tone during his press conference after the bank's July 31 meeting, saying that \"if the economy and prices move in line with our projection, we will continue to raise interest rates,\" according to Reuters.\n\nHe also said there was \"still quite some distance\" before its policy rate reaches a neutral level that neither cools nor overheats the economy.\n\nUeda also said the 0.5% interest rate level -- Japan has not seen that since 2008 -- was not a barrier, and rates could go even higher.\n\nTay said the yen can indicate whether the Japanese market will do well. As the yen has strengthened, stocks have declined, \"there is still a lot more pressure on the Japanese stock market, unfortunately,\" he said.\n\nWhile Tay acknowledged that some gains made by the market were due to corporate restructuring efforts by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, \"the main driver was the Japanese yen.\"\n\nOne factor why the yen has featured so heavily in Japanese market is what is known as the unwinding of the \"yen carry trade.\"\n\nWhen the yen was weak and interest rates from the BOJ were at zero or negative, investors would borrow in yen, and invest the proceeds in higher yielding assets.\n\nTaking the central bank benchmark interest rates as a guide, an investor could have borrowed yen at a 0% interest rate earlier in the year, and invested the money in the U.S., earning an interest of 5.25%.\n\nNow, with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling rate cuts are on the table and the Bank of Japan raising rates, the interest differential between the two central banks will narrow, making a \"carry trade\" less attractive, potentially setting the stage for the yen to strengthen further.\n\nTay expects the yen to reach about 143 to the dollar, but if Japanese life insurance companies and pension funds start repatriating more yen back to Japan, the currency could go to 135 against the greenback.\n\n\"So, yes, it [the yen] might find a level, but at this point in time, the Japanese stock market is still not attractive enough for me to actually want to go into.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"},

This was the index's worst showing in percentage terms since the October 1987 crash.\n\nJapan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27 per cent drop from a Jul 11 peak of 42,426.77.\n\nFrom Jul 11 to Monday's close of 31,458.42, Nikkei has wiped out 113 trillion yen (S$1 trillion) of that peak market value.\n\n\"The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade - investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks,\" said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.\n\n\"We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.\"\n\nThe Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop in point terms, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct 20, 1987 when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government was monitoring markets with \"grave concern\".\n\n\"It's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks,\" Suzuki told reporters.\n\nMost analysts said neither interest rate expectations nor economic data could explain the severity of the sell-off, although it was possibly driven by the rise in the yen whose near-zero short-term yields and steady depreciation had made it the funding currency for billions of US dollars worth of investments for years.\n\nThe yen was last up 2.5 per cent at 142.96 per US dollar, and has risen 14 per cent in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.\n\n\"In short, not only the currency but the entire 'value' trade in Japan which had hijacked our market for two years is being unwound,\" said Richard Kaye, a portfolio manager at Comgest in Tokyo.\n\nUS stocks sold off for a second straight session on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite index confirmed it was in correction territory after the jobs report stoked fears of a recession and expectations for a big Federal Reserve rate cut in September.\n\nUS stock futures were sharply lower in a sign Wall Street shares were set for a fresh sell-off.\n\n\"I think the US economic slowdown worries were too much, but the market did turn nervous after the Bank of Japan's rate hike as they thought the domestic economy is not strong enough to justify the rate hike,\" said Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\nThe banking sector slumped 17 per cent to become the worst sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes.\n\nChip-equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell 18.48 per cent and was the biggest drag on the Nikkei. Uniqlo brand owner Fast Retailing lost 9.59 per cent and technology investor SoftBank Group sank 18.66 per cent.\n\nThe broader Topix fell 12.2 per cent to 2,227.15, its weakest since mid-October and also moved into bear territory as it clocked a 25 per cent decline from its Jul 11 peak.

This was the index's worst showing in percentage terms since the October 1987 crash.\n\nJapan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27% drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77.\n\nJAPAN'S ECONOMY MUST SHIFT AWAY FROM 'CRISIS-MODE' TO DEMAND-DRIVEN GROWTH, GOVERNMENT PANEL SAYS\n\nFrom July 11 to Monday's close of 31,458.42, Nikkei has wiped out $792 billion of that peak market value.\n\n\"The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade - investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly U.S. tech stocks,\" said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.\n\n\"We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.\"\n\nThe Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop in point terms, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct. 20, 1987, when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.\n\nGERMANY ECLIPSES JAPAN AS WORLD'S THIRD-LARGEST ECONOMY\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government was monitoring markets with \"grave concern\".\n\n\"It's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks,\" Suzuki told reporters.\n\nMost analysts said neither interest rate expectations nor economic data could explain the severity of the sell-off, although it was possibly driven by the rise in the yen whose near-zero short-term yields and steady depreciation had made it the funding currency for billions of dollars worth of investments for years.\n\nThe yen was last up 2.5% at 142.96 per dollar, and has risen 14% in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.\n\n\"In short, not only the currency but the entire 'value' trade in Japan which had hijacked our market for two years is being unwound,\" said Richard Kaye, a portfolio manager at Comgest in Tokyo.\n\nU.S. stocks sold off for a second straight session on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite index confirmed it was in correction territory after the jobs report stoked fears of a recession and expectations for a big Federal Reserve rate cut in September. [.N]\n\nU.S. stock futures were sharply lower in a sign Wall Street shares were set for a fresh selloff.\n\n\"I think the U.S. economic slowdown worries were too much, but the market did turn nervous after the Bank of Japan's rate hike as they thought the domestic economy is not strong enough to justify the rate hike,\" said Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe banking sector slumped 17% to become the worst sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes.\n\nChip-equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell 18.48% and was the biggest drag on the Nikkei.

Once it reverses, you got to get out right and I think they're all getting out right now as a result of that,\" Tay said.\n\nThe yen, which weakened to a 38-year low of 161.99 against the U.S. dollar in June, reversed course during the run-up to the Bank of Japan's policy meeting.\n\nIt strengthened sharply after the BOJ raised its benchmark interest rate last week to around 0.25% and decided to trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds.\n\nCurrently, the yen was last trading at 144.82, its lowest level against the greenback since January. A stronger yen pressurizes Japanese stock markets, which are heavily dominated by trading houses and export-oriented firms by eroding their competitiveness.\n\nBOJ governor Kazuo Ueda had struck a hawkish tone during his press conference after the bank's July 31 meeting, saying that \"if the economy and prices move in line with our projection, we will continue to raise interest rates,\" according to Reuters.\n\nHe also said there was \"still quite some distance\" before its policy rate reaches a neutral level that neither cools nor overheats the economy.\n\nUeda also said the 0.5% interest rate level -- Japan has not seen that since 2008 -- was not a barrier, and rates could go even higher.\n\nTay said the yen can indicate whether the Japanese market will do well. As the yen has strengthened, stocks have declined, \"there is still a lot more pressure on the Japanese stock market, unfortunately,\" he said.\n\nWhile Tay acknowledged that some gains made by the market were due to corporate restructuring efforts by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, \"the main driver was the Japanese yen.\"\n\nOne factor why the yen has featured so heavily in Japanese market is what is known as the unwinding of the \"yen carry trade.\"\n\nWhen the yen was weak and interest rates from the BOJ were at zero or negative, investors would borrow in yen, and invest the proceeds in higher yielding assets.\n\nTaking the central bank benchmark interest rates as a guide, an investor could have borrowed yen at a 0% interest rate earlier in the year, and invested the money in the U.S., earning an interest of 5.25%.\n\nNow, with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling rate cuts are on the table and the Bank of Japan raising rates, the interest differential between the two central banks will narrow, making a \"carry trade\" less attractive, potentially setting the stage for the yen to strengthen further.\n\nTay expects the yen to reach about 143 to the dollar, but if Japanese life insurance companies and pension funds start repatriating more yen back to Japan, the currency could go to 135 against the greenback.\n\n\"So, yes, it [the yen] might find a level, but at this point in time, the Japanese stock market is still not attractive enough for me to actually want to go into.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"},

Japan's Nikkei closed 13% lower.\n\nGermany's DAX, France's CAC 40, Britain's FTSE and Spain's IBEX 35 all fell more than 2%.\n\nNIKKEI'S 1987 DEJA VU\n\n\"You don't get the Nikkei falling by its largest amount in nearly 40 years without some kind of repercussions across European markets,\" Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group said.\n\n\"These things don't usually stop on a dime, it takes a few days to sort out... but the initial panic appears to be over.\"\n\nJapanese stocks collapsed Monday in their biggest single day rout since the 1987 Black Monday sell-offs, driven by last week's plunge in global stock markets, economic concerns and worries investments funded by a cheap yen were being unwound.\n\nThe Nikkei share average shed a staggering 12.4% as Friday's dismal U.S. jobs data heightened worries of a possible recession, and as the yen rallied to 7-month highs versus the dollar. This was the index's worst showing in percentage terms since the October 1987 crash.\n\nJapan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27% drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77.\n\nFrom July 11 to Monday's close of 31,458.42, Nikkei has wiped out 113 trillion yen ($792 billion) of that peak market value.\n\n\"The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade - investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly U.S. tech stocks,\" said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.\n\n\"We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.\"\n\nThe Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop in point terms, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct. 20, 1987 when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government was monitoring markets with \"grave concern.\"\n\n\"It's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks,\" Suzuki told reporters.\n\nMost analysts said neither interest rate expectations nor economic data could explain the severity of the sell-off, although it was possibly driven by the rise in the yen whose near-zero short-term yields and steady depreciation had made it the funding currency for billions of dollars worth of investments for years.\n\nThe yen was last up 2.5% at 142.96 per dollar, and has risen 14% in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.\n\n\"In short, not only the currency but the entire 'value' trade in Japan which had hijacked our market for two years is being unwound,\" said Richard Kaye, a portfolio manager at Comgest in Tokyo.\n\nNASDAQ FUTURES DOWN 3.98%\n\nU.S. stock index futures tumbled Monday, with those tied to the Nasdaq falling nearly 4%, as fears of the United States slipping into a recession rippled through global markets.\n\nAll megacap and growth stocks, the main drivers for the indexes hitting record highs earlier this year, fell sharply in premarket trading.\n\nApple Inc. slumped 7.3% after Berkshire Hathaway slashed its stake in the iPhone maker by almost 50%, suggesting that the billionaire investor is growing wary about the broader U.S. economy or stock market valuations that have gotten too high.\n\nNvidia fell 6.8% after reports of a delay in the launch of its upcoming artificial-intelligence chips due to design flaws.\n\nAt 5:19 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 657 points, or 1.65%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 137 points, or 2.55%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 738.75 points, or 3.98%.\n\nThe weak jobs report and shrinking manufacturing activity in the world's largest economy, coupled with dismal forecast from the big technology firms, pushed the Nasdaq 100 and Nasdaq Composite into a correction last week.\n\nThe weak jobs data also triggered what is known as the \"Sahm Rule,\" seen by many as a historically accurate recession indicator.\n\nThe data prompted traders to assign a 91.5% probability that the U.S. central bank will cut the benchmark rates by 50 basis points in the September meeting and see year-end rates at 4-4.25% from the current 5.25%-5.50%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nFEAR GAUGE SPIKES\n\nBig Wall Street brokerages also revised their Fed rate projections for 2024 to show greater policy easing by the central bank.\n\n\"I am reluctant to believe the Fed would start the easing process with a 50 bps cut, but if the next seven weeks of data are consistent with this week's, the Fed should be aggressive,\" said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.\n\nA slew of Fed officials will be speaking on the economy and monetary policy through the week and any indication on the interest rate cuts could soothe the frayed nerves of investors.\n\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly after the bell.</p> <p>Futures tracking small-cap index Rusell 2000 dipped 3.7%.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" breached its long-term average level of 20 points last week and was currently at 35.19, highest since May 2022.\n\nCrypto-linked stocks fell after Bitcoin hit its lowest in five months. Coinbase Global was down 9.9%, U.S.-listed shares of Bitfarms fell 10.1%, Microstrategy slid 12.8% and Riot Platforms was down 9.8%.\n\nENERGY STOCKS\n\nIn Europe, energy stocks took the most hit, falling 3.4% after oil prices dropped 1% as U.S. recession fears offset supply worries in Middle East.\n\nFinancial shares were also hit. Banks lost 3%, financials services shed 2.8% while the tech sector slipped 2.1%.\n\nInvestors will get a read on U.S. employment in the service sector from the ISM non-manufacturing survey later in the day.\n\nLast week, a worryingly weak July payrolls report sparked investor worries on the health of the U.S. economy, spurring a risk-off sentiment globally.\n\nThe STOXX 600 saw its worst week in nearly 10 months on Friday and fell below the 500-mark for the first time since April 15.\n\nMarkets see a 78% chance of a 50-basis-point cut by the Federal Reserve on Sept. 18, while traders expect a second cut by the European Central bank on Sept. 12.\n\nOn the data front, growth in euro zone business activity stalled last month - Purchasing Managers' Index for the currency union fell to 50.2 in July from 50.9 in June.\n\nGrowth in Germany's services sector slowed for the second consecutive month in July.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Galderma gained 6.7% after L'Oreal said it would acquire a 10% stake in the Swiss skincare firm from a group of major shareholders.\n\nOCI Global jumped 10.3% after Woodside Energy said it would acquire the Dutch chemicals maker's clean ammonia project in

The currency was trading near its strongest level since early January.\n\nThe dollar dropped 0.5% against major currencies to trade at 102.62 - a near five-month low.\n\n\"Fears of a U.S. recession mean that the market is no longer looking for an orderly adjustment in Fed policy towards some kind of neutral rate - say near 3.25%. No, the fear of a recession is now bringing in the idea of stimulative monetary policy,\" noted Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.\n\n\"It is no surprise to see low-yielding currencies now in the ascendancy as the rest of the world now starts to converge on their low interest rates.\"\n\nThe yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past three weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's 15-basis points rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it announced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the next couple of years.\n\nBarclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most overbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more outperformance in the near term appears high\".\n\nThe Swiss franc, another popular funding currency, was up more than 1% at 0.84825 to the dollar. The franc, a traditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high.\n\nHigh-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee and Mexican peso tumbled, while currencies that had hitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and China's yuan , rallied strongly.\n\nTreasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last week, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its current 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened the possibility of a rate cut in September.\n\nBut by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had jumped, which sparked chatter the U.S. economy could be heading for a recession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries sank nearly 40 basis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March 2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n\nFed fund futures reflected traders pricing a near 99% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September meeting, according to LSEG data. Futures imply 127 basis points of cuts this year.\n\nThe euro was up 0.2% at $1.0954 despite the expectation for interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank (ECB) surging. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of rate cut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps at the start of last week.\n\nMeanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of military escalation in the Middle East after latest developments in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven oil prices to their lowest since January.\n\nThe U.S. military is deploying more forces in the Middle East and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last week in Tehran. - Reuters", "source": {"uri":

On Monday it tumbled 12.4%, marking its second-largest decline on record and its biggest since the Black Monday crash of October 1987.\n\nIn part, the sell-off has been driven by the recent turnaround in the yen after the Bank of Japan began to raise rates for the first time in decades, most recently last week.\n\nNow investors are forced to size up Japan Inc's prospects without the extra cushion from the currency, which has helped many heavyweight exporters. Up until a few days ago, the Japanese stock market was seen as a global stand-out, having gained almost 30% last year and touching a lifetime high last month.\n\n\"All the benefits, all the tailwinds from forex that have been propping up Nikkei 225 stocks and exporters, multinationals, it's all gone,\" said Amir Anvarzadeh of Asymmetric Advisors, a Japan-focused equity advisory firm.\n\nNow, companies now will have to do well on their own merits, he said.\n\nA weaker yen drives up cost for small businesses and households, but it is largely positive for big exporters, such as Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), because it makes their products cheaper overseas and boosts profits when foreign earnings are brought home.\n\nThe yen traded around its strongest level in seven months on Monday, at 142 to the dollar. It has gained about 14% over the last month, recovering after months of losses.\n\nTo get a sense of the size of the potential disruption for Japan's industrial giants, one need look no further than Toyota. The world's largest automaker says every 1 yen change against the dollar means a difference of 50 billion yen ($350 million) in profit.\n\nAt Toyota's latest quarterly earnings, announced last week, the currency contributed 370 billion yen to operating profit.\n\nThe selling has spread beyond exporters, with banks and other industries also shredded, casting a cloud over the Japanese market's recent comeback, which was seen as a triumphant revival after years in deflationary doldrums.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS SOLID\n\nWhile corporate Japan's fundamentals remain largely solid, analysts said, the sell-off is a reminder that markets - at least in the short-term - do not always reflect fundamentals.\n\nWith many exporters assuming a yen exchange rate of 140 or 145 to the dollar, investors had been expecting to see stronger earnings ahead given the yen traded at 160 a few weeks ago, said Kei Okamura, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman in Tokyo.\n\n\"A lot of global investors have been looking for Japanese companies to announce upward revisions\" due to the currency, he said.\n\n\"That's why from some people's perspective the upward revisions might not be there, but from our perspective, the fundamentals still look okay.\"\n\nExporters' shares were also hit by concerns about a slowdown in the United States, one of Japan's biggest export markets, and one absolutely vital to its auto industry.\n\n\"If the U.S. economy slows down, cars won't sell,\" said Takatoshi Itoshima, a strategist at Pictet Asset Management Japan.\n\nAutomakers are also heavyweight components of the Nikkei and the broader Topix index, Itoshima said, something that adds to the overall pain for markets.\n\nSubaru (OTC:FUJHY), which reported that almost 80% of its revenue came from North America in the first quarter, on Monday said it was sticking by its forecast for a 142 yen exchange rate for the full year.\n\nChief Financial Officer Katsuyuki Mizuma told an earnings briefing the automaker would have to take a look at the incentives it offers in the United States. Every 1 yen increase in the exchange rate meant a shift in 10 billion yen of operating profit, he said.\n\nPrinter maker Epson last week said it was revising its exchange rate assumption to 151 yen to the dollar from 144 yen previously - and lifting its profit outlook as a result, which now may look in doubt.\n\nThe market turmoil may come with a silver lining for investors who look beyond a group of Japan's export champions.\n\nThe yen's reversal could offer relief to the broader economy after its months-long decline has pushed up consumer prices, raising deep concerns about the outlook for spending in Japan.\n\nThe yen's decline has even prompted the founder of Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing to warn there was \"no merit\" to a weaker yen, given that Japan imports raw materials from all over the world before manufacturing and exporting.\n\n\"A stronger yen might not be good for the Nikkei 225 stocks and the foreigners owning it,\" said Anvarzadeh of Asymmetric Advisors.\n\n\"But it's good for the country, it's good for the economy.\"", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Monday it tumbled 12.4%, marking its second-largest decline on record and its biggest since the Black Monday crash of October 1987.\n\nIn part, the sell-off has been driven by the recent turnaround in the yen after the Bank of Japan began to raise rates for the first time in decades, most recently last week.\n\nNow investors are forced to size up Japan Inc's prospects without the extra cushion from the currency, which has helped many heavyweight exporters. Up until a few days ago, the Japanese stock market was seen as a global stand-out, having gained almost 30% last year and touching a lifetime high last month.\n\n\"All the benefits, all the tailwinds from forex that have been propping up Nikkei 225 stocks and exporters, multinationals, it's all gone,\" said Amir Anvarzadeh of Asymmetric Advisors, a Japan-focused equity advisory firm.\n\nNow, companies now will have to do well on their own merits, he said.\n\nA weaker yen drives up cost for small businesses and households, but it is largely positive for big exporters, such as Toyota Motor, because it makes their products cheaper overseas and boosts profits when foreign earnings are brought home.\n\nThe yen traded around its strongest level in seven months on Monday, at 142 to the dollar. It has gained about 14% over the last month, recovering after months of losses.\n\nTo get a sense of the size of the potential disruption for Japan's industrial giants, one need look no further than Toyota. The world's largest automaker says every 1 yen change against the dollar means a difference of 50 billion yen ($350 million) in profit.\n\nAt Toyota's latest quarterly earnings, announced last week, the currency contributed 370 billion yen to operating profit.\n\nThe selling has spread beyond exporters, with banks and other industries also shredded, casting a cloud over the Japanese market's recent comeback, which was seen as a triumphant revival after years in deflationary doldrums.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS SOLID\n\nWhile corporate Japan's fundamentals remain largely solid, analysts said, the sell-off is a reminder that markets - at least in the short-term - do not always reflect fundamentals.\n\nWith many exporters assuming a yen exchange rate of 140 or 145 to the dollar, investors had been expecting to see stronger earnings ahead given the yen traded at 160 a few weeks ago, said Kei Okamura, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman in Tokyo.\n\n\"A lot of global investors have been looking for Japanese companies to announce upward revisions\" due to the currency, he said.\n\n\"That's why from some people's perspective the upward revisions might not be there, but from our perspective, the fundamentals still look okay.\"\n\nExporters' shares were also hit by concerns about a slowdown in the United States, one of Japan's biggest export markets, and one absolutely vital to its auto industry.\n\n\"If the U.S. economy slows down, cars won't sell,\" said Takatoshi Itoshima, a strategist at Pictet Asset Management Japan.\n\nAutomakers are also heavyweight components of the Nikkei and the broader Topix index, Itoshima said, something that adds to the overall pain for markets.\n\nSubaru, which reported that almost 80% of its revenue came from North America in the first quarter, on Monday said it was sticking by its forecast for a 142 yen exchange rate for the full year.\n\nChief Financial Officer Katsuyuki Mizuma told an earnings briefing the automaker would have to take a look at the incentives it offers in the United States. Every 1 yen increase in the exchange rate meant a shift in 10 billion yen of operating profit, he said.\n\nPrinter maker Epson last week said it was revising its exchange rate assumption to 151 yen to the dollar from 144 yen previously - and lifting its profit outlook as a result, which now may look in doubt.\n\nThe market turmoil may come with a silver lining for investors who look beyond a group of Japan's export champions.\n\nThe yen's reversal could offer relief to the broader economy after its months-long decline has pushed up consumer prices, raising deep concerns about the outlook for spending in Japan.\n\nThe yen's decline has even prompted the founder of Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing to warn there was \"no merit\" to a weaker yen, given that Japan imports raw materials from all over the world before manufacturing and exporting.\n\n\"A stronger yen might not be good for the Nikkei 225 stocks and the foreigners owning it,\" said Anvarzadeh of Asymmetric Advisors.\n\n\"But it's good for the country, it's good for the economy.\"\n\n($1 = 142.7500 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Sam Nussey, Daniel Leussink and Rocky Swift; Additional reporting by Maki Shiraki and Nobuhiro Kubo; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

crash nightmare: Nikkei 225 index sees largest drop ever", "body": "Tokyo's stock market nosedived more than 12 per cent this morning in the latest bout of sell-offs to shake world markets as investors fret over the state of the US economy.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index suffered its largest points drop in history, plunging 12.40%, or 4,451.28 points, to 31,458.42 as the broader Topix index lost 12.23%, or 310.45 points, to 2,227.15.\n\nBy the close on Monday, the index had wiped out 113 trillion yen ($792.32 billion) of the Nikkei market value since July 11, when it peaked at 42,426.77 - a drop of 27%.\n\nIt comes after a solemn Friday on Wall Street where the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 1.5% as data showed the US jobs market cooled much more than expected in July.\n\nEuropean stock markets also closed sharply in the red at the end of last week.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index suffered its largest points drop in history, plunging 12.40%, or 4,451.28 points, to 31,458.42 as the broader Topix index lost 12.23%, or 310.45 points, to 2,227.15\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki declared today the government was cooperating with the central bank and closely monitoring markets with a sense of urgency.\n\n'It's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks,' Suzuki told reporters, adding that authorities were watching stock market moves with 'grave concern'.\n\nPoor jobs data and speculation that the US is headed for a recession sent world markets plunging last week.\n\nBut Japan's stocks were hit particularly hard, with concern over the US economy compounded as the Japanese yen rallied to seven-month highs versus the dollar.\n\nIn an attempt to calm volatility in the market, futures trading was suspended for 10 minutes as a so-called 'circuit-breaker' on the Nikkei and Topix indexes on the Osaka Exchange in Japan's western metropolis, an exchange official said.\n\nWorries over weakness in the US economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, even though the US economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.5% to 16,519.78 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.8% to 7,637.40.\n\nThe latest setback has been particularly damaging for markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted 9.3% as Samsung's shares sank 11.6%.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%.\n\nSemiconductor shares plunged with Tokyo Electron nosediving 18.48% to 22,055 yen and Advantest tumbling 15.84% to 5,313 yen.\n\nToyota plummeted 13.65% to 2,232 yen.\n\nA man is reflected on an electric stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo\n\nThe Bank of Japan last week raised interest rates for the second time in 17 years, with talk of another rate hike to come, while the US Federal Reserve has hinted at a cut as soon as September.\n\nDaiwa Securities said the losses in Tokyo reflected 'deepening concerns over the uncertain US economy'.\n\n'Investor sentiment was down as the US employment data for July came in lower than expected, raising fears that the US economy is slowing more than expected,' IwaiCosmo Securities said.\n\n'The market was also weighed down by the yen's appreciation against the dollar and as expectations for exporters' upbeat financial results receded,' the brokerage added.\n\n'The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade - investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks,' said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.\n\n'We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.'", "source":

The franc, a traditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high.\n\nHigh-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee and Mexican peso tumbled, while currencies that had hitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and China's yuan, rallied.\n\nTreasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last week, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its current 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened the possibility of a rate cut in September.\n\nBut by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had jumped, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n\nJapanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single day rout since the 1987 Black Monday sell-offs.\n\nThe euro was up 0.3% at $1.0944 against a broadly-weaker dollar.\n\nExpectations for European Central Bank (ECB) rate cuts have also risen. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of rate cut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps a week ago.\n\n\"This is a position unwind and since the National Assembly election was called in France, no one's been long euros,\" Kit Juckes, head of FX Strategy at Societe Generale said, referring to the euro's slide in June after a snap election was called in France.\n\n\"The euro will be capped by rate and growth expectations but probably range-bound as a result.\"\n\n(Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, Sruthi Shankar and Sarupya Ganguly in Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher Cushing,

The currency was trading near its strongest level since early January.\n\nThe dollar dropped 0.5% against major currencies to trade at 102.62 - a near five-month low.\n\n\"Fears of a U.S. recession mean that the market is no longer looking for an orderly adjustment in Fed policy towards some kind of neutral rate - say near 3.25%. No, the fear of a recession is now bringing in the idea of stimulative monetary policy,\" noted Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.\n\n\"It is no surprise to see low-yielding currencies now in the ascendancy as the rest of the world now starts to converge on their low interest rates.\"\n\nThe yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past three weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's 15-basis points rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it announced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the next couple of years.\n\nBarclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most overbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more outperformance in the near term appears high\".\n\nThe Swiss franc, another popular funding currency, was up more than 1% at 0.84825 to the dollar. The franc, a traditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high.\n\nHigh-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee and Mexican peso tumbled, while currencies that had hitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and China's yuan , rallied strongly.\n\nTreasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last week, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its current 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened the possibility of a rate cut in September.\n\nBut by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had jumped, which sparked chatter the U.S. economy could be heading for a recession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries sank nearly 40 basis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March 2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n\nFed fund futures reflected traders pricing a near 99% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September meeting, according to LSEG data. Futures imply 127 basis points of cuts this year.\n\nThe euro was up 0.2% at $1.0954 despite the expectation for interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank (ECB) surging. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of rate cut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps at the start of last week.\n\nMeanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of military escalation in the Middle East after latest developments in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven oil prices to their lowest since January.\n\nThe U.S. military is deploying more forces in the Middle East and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last week in Tehran.\n\n(Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan

A look at what is Yen carry trade and what it means for the financial markets worldwide:\n\nWhat is a Carry Trade?\n\nA carry trade is a hugely popular trading strategy where an investor borrows from a country with low interest rates and a weaker currency and reinvests the money in assets of another country with a higher rate of return. It has been one of the biggest sources of flows in the global currency market.\n\nWhat is yen carry trade?\n\nThough carry trades have been done with several currencies, the Japanese yen is considered one of the most widely used currencies for this purpose. In yen carry trade, investors, including retail Japanese investors borrow at a low interest rate at home and purchase assets in another country with higher returns, such as overseas equities and bonds. US equities have been a favourite in recent times with the dollar strengthening. The yen has been popular for carry trades because Japan has maintained a zero-interest rate policy for over two decades, barring short periods in 2006-2008, to combat persistent deflation.\n\nWhy is yen carry trade in focus now?\n\nLast week, yen rose over 3% against the dollar after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised interest rates to 0.25% and announced it would reduce bond purchases. Expectations of interest rate cuts by the US Fed also contributed to the dollar's weakness. Though rates in Japan are still low, BoJ's moves are seen as signals that it is moving towards normalisation of monetary policy. Sharp moves in the yen do not happen often, which is why it has been a preferred currency for carry trades. The yen must remain weaker if these carry trades have to be profitable. So, when the yen strengthened against the dollar, investors rushed to square off or unwind their bets on yen as part of the carry trade to avoid losses.\n\nWhat is the quantum of yen carry trades?\n\nIt is impossible to know that number but Dutch bank ING said cross-border yen borrowing, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has increased by $742 billion since the end of 2021. While it is not known how much of it is for short-term speculation in overseas assets, ING said these unhedged cross-border yen loans could represent a \"substantial layer\" of the carry trade.\n\nWhat will be the impact of the yen carry trade unwinding on markets?\n\nThe repercussions of the unwinding of the yen carry trade were felt on markets worldwide. Market watchers said the severe selloff in shares of US-based mega technology giants late last week could also be on account of the reversal of the yen carry trades. The selloff in the US spilled over to Asian equities too, including India. Here on, a lot will depend on how much the yen strengthens against the dollar.\n\nHow will this impact Indian equities?\n\nIt is not clear how much money has flown into India as part of yen carry trades. Brokers said it would be safe to assume some carry trades would have happened involving Indian equities, which have been among the top-performing markets worldwide in recent years. According to NSDL data, the assets under custody of Japanese foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in domestic equities till June 30 was \u20b92.05 lakh crore. The highest was by US FPIs at \u20b930 lakh crore. A stronger yen could also be a cause of worry for some Indian companies, which have borrowed in yen but have not hedged against a sharp up-move in the currency.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rate of return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank for International Settlements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ING Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112274540,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-135222,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790421", "eventUri": "eng-9790421", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 3302, "textEnd": 3309}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Carmaker Subaru Corp. was down 10% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group was 15% lower.\n\nIn general, when the yen strengthens that tends to dent earnings for Japanese companies because it makes exports less competitive overseas and decreases the value of profits earned abroad in yen terms.\n\nEarlier this year, the Japanese stock index soared to record highs, driven by stronger corporate earnings on the back of a weak yen, the return of modest inflation and improvements in corporate governance.\n\nThe Japanese currency has been strengthening against the dollar since early July because of a narrowing interest-rate gap between Japan and the U.S.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate to 0.25% from a previous range of 0% to 0.1% and signaled that further increases were likely if the economy developed in line with the central bank's forecasts.\n\nWrite to Kosaku Narioka at kosaku.narioka@wsj.com", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumitomo_Mitsui_Banking_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.morningstar.com/assets/img/dow-jones.51166f0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790421", "eventUri": "eng-9790421", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 351, "textEnd": 361}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

On August 5th the Topix plunged by 13% in its worst performance since 1987. The index is now almost a quarter below its peak, reached barely a month ago. The yen, meanwhile, is snapping back: it is up 12% from less than a month ago, when it was at its weakest in 37 years. These sharp moves carry implications not just for Japanese investors and firms. The country's financial heft means that they could become a source of further volatility in nervous global markets.\n\nTopsy-turvy markets reflect changes in monetary policy. Over the past 18 months the yen sank as America's Federal Reserve raised interest rates and the Bank of Japan stood still. The \"carry trade\", where investors borrow cheaply in yen to make higher-yielding investments in dollars or euros, flourished, sending the Japanese currency lower still. The weaker currency then enhanced the foreign earnings of Japanese firms, and enticed foreign investors into the Japanese stockmarket. In 2023 and the first half of 2024, they snapped up \u00a59trn ($60bn) in stocks.\n\nNow things are unwinding. The Bank of Japan has taken baby steps to tighten policy. On July 31st it raised its benchmark rate from around 0.1% to around 0.25%. The Fed, by contrast, is expected to begin cutting rates soon. Anticipation grew on August 2nd after the release of America's jobs report, which showed the economy had added 114,000 jobs in July, below the 175,000 expected by investors.\n\nA modest move in rate differences has been amplified by a rapid turnaround in speculative bets. Investors had crowded into short yen trades -- bets on a further depreciation in the Japanese currency -- according to data from the American Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Such one-way traffic can cause sudden shifts in the other direction, as speculators abandon their trades and cover their losses, bidding up the yen in the process.\n\nThe spiking yen has, in turn, fuelled a stockmarket collapse. The rally had been led by Japan's exporters, which benefit almost mechanically from a weaker currency, as they make most of their money overseas but report earnings in yen. Now they are suffering. Margin bets on Japanese stocks -- trades made with borrowed money -- had reached the highest level since 2006 before the sell-off began. These leveraged investments now appear to be being unwound at pace, explaining why market darlings are suffering some of the biggest falls. The share price of Tokyo Electron, a vital supplier of semiconductor kit, fell by 18% on August 5th. Japanese banks are down by 27% in the space of two trading days.\n\nFor now, the slump appears to be driven by this unwinding of speculative bets. Few analysts think Japanese firms are in deep distress, or fear for the stability of the country's financial system. Nonetheless, rapid changes in Japan can have knock-on consequences. As interest-rate moves make the carry trade less viable, they could fuel a sell-off in far-flung corners of foreign markets. Japan is also the largest creditor in the world. The country's investors owned $10.6trn in foreign assets at the end of last year. They have become big buyers of American and Australian collateralised-loan obligations, for instance. If the stronger yen means these investors need to dump foreign holdings to meet liabilities at home, that could weaken asset prices while driving the yen still higher. Just how much further the yen has to rise, and Japanese stocks to fall, remains to be seen. But until investors' speculative bets fully unravel, expect choppy market conditions. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speculation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Electron", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Electron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liability (financial accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.economist.com/content-assets/images/20240810_FNP501.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790421", "eventUri": "eng-9790421", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 73, "textEnd": 83, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1189, "textEnd": 1198}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 1346, "textEnd": 1356}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The sell-off is attributed to concerns that the US may be heading into a recession, exacerbated by a weak jobs report and expectations of a significant rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, which has also affected the US dollar and boosted the yen.\n\nThe yen rose nearly 1 percent to 145.11 per dollar, after peaking at 144.76 earlier in the session. Ryota Abe, an economist with SMBC in Singapore, expects the yen to trade between 140 and 145 against the dollar due to worsening economic data and ongoing Middle East tensions. The stronger yen is anticipated to impact the Nikkei negatively, as it reduces corporate margins.\n\nThe yen has surged 10 percent against the dollar over the past three weeks, partly due to the Bank of Japan's recent interest rate hike. Shoichi Arisawa of IwaiCosmo Securities attributes the domestic equity downturn to these economic uncertainties.\n\nSeiichi Suzuki, chief equity market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory, anticipates market instability until October but suggests buying stocks now, citing unchanged fundamental factors such as corporate governance reforms.\n\nIn other regions, Indian shares fell approximately 2 percent, Taiwan's benchmark dropped 7.9 percent, and South Korean equities declined more than 5 percent.

No, the fear of a recession is now bringing in the idea of stimulative monetary policy,\" noted Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.\n\n\"It is no surprise to see low-yielding currencies now in the ascendancy as the rest of the world now starts to converge on their low interest rates.\"\n\nThe yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past three weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's 15-basis points rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it announced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the next couple of years.\n\nBarclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most overbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more outperformance in the near term appears high\".\n\nThe Swiss franc, another popular funding currency, was up more than 1% at 0.84825 to the dollar. The franc, a traditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high.\n\nHigh-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee and Mexican peso tumbled, while currencies that had hitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and China's yuan, rallied strongly.\n\nTreasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last week, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its current 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened the possibility of a rate cut in September.\n\nBut by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had jumped, which sparked chatter the U.S. economy could be heading for a recession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries sank nearly 40 basis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March 2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n\nFed fund futures reflected traders pricing a near 99% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September meeting, according to LSEG data. Futures imply 127 basis points of cuts this year.\n\nThe euro was up 0.2% at $1.0954 despite the expectation for interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank (ECB) surging. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of rate cut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps at the start of last week.\n\nMeanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of military escalation in the Middle East after latest developments in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven oil prices to their lowest since January.\n\nThe U.S. military is deploying more forces in the Middle East and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last week in Tehran.\n\n(Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan

Japan's rate hike sent Asian markets sharply lower on Monday. US stock futures are also down. The Japanese yen rose sharply following the Bank of Japan's rate hike, unwinding global carry trade.\n\nGlobal markets opened on Monday on a sour note, with Japan's interest-rate hike last week hurting assets ranging from stocks to Bitcoin.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell as much as 8% by 1:45\u202fp.m local time. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi was 7% lower.\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 was down 3.3%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index was 0.9% lower while and China's CSI 300 was little changed -- but the Chinese stock markets have been under pressure this year due to the country's economic troubles.\n\nInvestors are also on edge before the US markets open later in the global day. S&P 500 futures were down 1.7% at 11:57 p.m. ET on Sunday, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 0.8% lower. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 3.4%.\n\nBitcoin fell 13% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe negativity in US stocks ahead of the week's opening came after a recent selloff in tech stocks as euphoria over artificial intelligence fizzled, with investors questioning when they would be seeing returns.\n\nA weak July jobs report from the US added to investor gloom, sparking a selloff in US stocks on Friday, just days after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady again.\n\nBut it's not just the US economy and the Fed that is weighing on the markets. It's also about Japan's interest-rate hike last Wednesday.\n\nGlobal carry trade unwinding\n\nThe Bank of Japan raised its interest rate from between 0% and 0.1% to 0.25% on Wednesday -- the highest level in 15 years.\n\nEven though it appears tiny, it matters because the Japanese yen has been the focus of carry trade, where traders profit from a divergence in interest rates across the world. Since the turnover in global foreign exchange markets is massive -- it reached a record $7.5 trillion per day in April 2022, according to a triennial survey -- the fallout can be huge.\n\nJapan kept interest rates ultra-low for decades following the implosion of an asset bubble in the 1990s that contributed to persistent deflation. It continued holding rates low after the pandemic, in contrast to other major central banks that started hiking them.\n\nThis created a divergence in monetary policy that impacted the Japanese yen, which sank to a near four-decade-low against the strong US dollar last month.\n\nThis divergence helped carry trade, which, as ING analysts explained on Monday, has been a dominant successful investment strategy this year.\n\nIt involves \"borrowing cheaply in yen -- on the expectation that the yen will continue to fall -- and investing in some high-yielding currency or asset preferably backed by a strong macro argument,\" the ING analysts added.\n\nHowever, this strategy is now hit with a hitch, as the BOJ's rate hike last week sent the yen up -- it's 7.5% higher over the last five trading days and is 1.6% lower against the dollar so far this year.\n\nThe hike has also fanned further risk-off sentiment in global stock markets.\n\n\"The unwinding of yen shorts is undoubtedly contributing to the global risk-off environment,\" wrote ING analysts in a separate July 25 note.\n\nThere are still be choppy waters ahead, particularly for risk assets, warned Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Bank's chief economist of Asia excluding Japan on Friday.\n\n\"The dark clouds of adverse feedback loop between 'carry' liquidation and 'risk off' contagion cannot be ignored,\" he added.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri":

From July 11 to Monday's close of 31,458.42, the Nikkei has wiped out 113 trillion yen ($792 billion) of its peak market value.\n\n\"The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade - investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly U.S. tech stocks,\" Capital.com's senior financial market analyst Kyle Rodda said. \"We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.\"\n\nIn the report, nonfarm payrolls increased by 114,000 jobs in July, well below the average of about 215,000 jobs added per month over the past year. That's also lower than the 200,000 jobs that economists say are needed to keep up with growth in the population, which accounts for the recent surge in legal and illegal immigration.\n\n\"If Fed officials had seen this report, they would have cut rates by 25 basis points this week,\" Boston College economics professor Brian Bethune said. \"There is absolutely no justification for continuing to exert an elevated level of monetary restrictiveness on the economy.\"\n\nEarly Monday morning, the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by about 600 points, or 1.5 percent, while the Nasdaq-100 dipped 3.4 percent. U.S. Treasury yields dropped as well, with the benchmark 10-year note at 3.79 percent. That's down from a week before when it yielded 4.20 percent.\n\nLast week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters that the U.S. central bank is likely to issue its first rate cut in four years, noting that the economy is making progress on persistent inflation.\n\n\"We're getting closer to the point at which it'll be appropriate to reduce our policy rate,\" Powell said, \"but we're not quite at that point.\"\n\nIn a transcript of a statement issued on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said that U.S. job increases \"have moderated\" and noted that the unemployment rate has been on the rise.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated. In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective,\" the Fed said, reiterating that it wants to keep inflation at around 2 percent in the long term.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleveraging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deleveraging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq-100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq-100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/05/id5699803-Nikkei-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790421", "eventUri": "eng-9790421", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 27, "textEnd": 35}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 493, "textEnd": 500, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Such a scenario bodes poorly for the dollar, and portends some strength in Asian currencies.\n\nBut weak risk appetite saw most Asian units soften on Monday. The Australian dollar's AUDUSD pair fell 0.2% before a Reserve Bank meeting on Tuesday, where the central bank is widely expected to keep rates unchanged following recent data that showed inflation was cooling slightly.\n\nThe Chinese yuan's USDCNY pair fell 0.3% to a six-month low, with a bulk of the strength coming from a stronger-than-expected midpoint fix by the PBOC. The central bank was also seen intervening in currency markets in July, as a string of weak readings on China's economy battered the yuan.\n\nBut private PMI data on Monday showed some resilience in the country's services sector.\n\nSouth Korean won's USDKRW pair rose 0.2%, while the Indian rupee's USDINR pair remained in sight of record highs.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsia FX muted as dollar dips on recession fears; yen surges to near 7-mth high\n\nDollar hits four-month low as weak US jobs data boosts rate cut bets", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Both the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indexes plummeted over 12%, marking a significant downturn.\n\nAccording to a report by CNBC, by Monday's close, the benchmark indexes had declined more than 20% from their record highs on 11 July. The Nikkei 225 experienced a staggering 12.4% drop, closing at 31,458.42. This represents the worst day for the index since the notorious \"Black Monday\" crash of 1987. In absolute terms, the Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points, the largest point drop in its history, erasing all its gains for the year and pushing it into negative territory year to date.\n\nThe broad-based TOPIX index also faced severe losses, dropping 12.23% to finish at 2,227.15. Major Japanese trading houses such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui & Co, Sumitomo, and Marubeni all saw their shares plummet over 14%, with Mitsui suffering nearly a 20% loss in market capitalization.\n\nThis sharp decline followed significant losses on Friday, where the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX fell by more than 5% and 6%, respectively. For the broader TOPIX, it was the worst single day in eight years, while the Nikkei marked its most severe drop since March 2020.\n\nIn currency markets, the Japanese yen strengthened to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since January, trading at 142.09 yen per dollar by 8:48 a.m. UTC.\n\nThe CNBC report also mentioned that other markets in the region also faced turmoil. South Korea's Kospi index fell 8.77%, closing at 2,441.55, while the smaller-cap Kosdaq experienced an 11.3% decline, ending at 691.28. The severe sell-off triggered circuit breakers, halting trade for 20 minutes on both indexes.\n\nTaiwan's Taiwan Weighted Index dropped over 8%, primarily due to losses in technology and real estate stocks. Meanwhile, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 3.7% to 7,649.6. The Reserve Bank of Australia commenced its two-day monetary policy meeting on Monday, with expectations for rates to remain steady at 4.35%. However, investors are keenly awaiting the bank's policy statement for any indications of a potential rate hike.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was down 1.62% towards the end of trading, and mainland China's CSI 300 index fell 1.21% to 3,343.32, the smallest decline in the region.\n\nThe U.S. markets also faced significant declines on Friday, spurred by a disappointing jobs report for July, raising fears of an impending recession. The Nasdaq was the first of the major U.S. indexes to enter correction territory, having dropped over 10% from its peak. The S&P 500 and Dow were down 5.7% and 3.9% from their all-time highs, respectively. The S&P 500 fell by 1.84%, the Nasdaq Composite by 2.43%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 610.71 points, or 1.51%.\n\nEarlier today, professional trader Adam Khoo offered insights into the panic sweeping Japan's markets. Khoo highlighted the sharp rise in the JPY/USD exchange rate, which has triggered a massive unwinding of Yen carry trade positions. This practice involves traders borrowing Japanese yen at low interest rates, converting it to U.S. dollars, and using it to buy U.S. stocks. With the Bank of Japan raising interest rates, the yen has strengthened significantly against the dollar, exacerbating the situation for these traders.\n\nKhoo explained that traders are now facing higher interest payments on their borrowed yen, coupled with substantial forex losses. The appreciation of the yen means that the U.S. assets held by these traders may no longer cover their yen-denominated debts. Consequently, traders are unwinding their positions by selling U.S. stocks to raise dollars, converting them back to yen to repay their loans. This process adds further selling pressure on U.S. stocks, potentially leading to more declines in the near term.\n\nCompounding these financial strains are geopolitical tensions, including the escalating conflict in the Middle East and uncertainties in U.S. politics, which have fueled the prevailing fear and panic. Khoo views this crisis as an opportunity for investors to acquire high-quality U.S. stocks at significant discounts, capitalizing on temporary mispricings caused by short-term market turmoil.",

This has caused the dollar to depreciate, dragging down US Treasury yields and stock indexes, while boosting the yen and China's yuan. Interestingly, high-yielding currencies like the Indian rupee and Mexican peso have taken a hit, in contrast to the yen's rally. The euro saw a modest rise by 0.2% to $1.0937, while the Australian dollar dipped to $0.6488, down 0.36%, and the dollar index slid 0.4% to 102.72.\n\nThe surge in the yen and yuan, coupled with the fall of high-yielding currencies, signals a shift in global investment dynamics. Investors are scrambling to adjust their portfolios amid growing recession worries and potential rate cuts by the Fed. This currency upheaval could herald a volatile period for markets, making it essential for investors to stay agile.\n\nThe bigger picture: Shifting tides of global economics.\n\nThe broad economic implications are profound as recession fears in the US ripple across global markets. With the yen rallying partly due to the Bank of Japan's recent rate hike to 0.25%, and increased military tensions in the Middle East adding to the uncertainty, the landscape for global trade and investment is becoming increasingly complex.

This dramatic fall surpassed the previous record set on October 20, 1987, when the index fell by 3,836 points.\n\nThe Nikkei 225, which represents the performance of 225 large, publicly owned companies in Japan, is a key indicator of the country's economic health and investor sentiment. The index's sharp decline has sent shockwaves through the financial markets, raising concerns about the stability of the Japanese economy and the potential for a global ripple effect.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the Nikkei's historic drop. One of the primary drivers was the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) recent decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly two decades. This move was aimed at curbing inflation and stabilizing the yen, which had been weakening against the dollar. However, the rate hike had unintended consequences, as it led to a sharp rise in the yen's value and increased the cost of borrowing for Japanese companies.\n\nThe strengthening yen has particularly impacted Japan's export-oriented sectors, such as automobiles and electronics, which rely heavily on overseas markets. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive and less competitive in international markets, potentially leading to reduced profits and market share for these companies. This, in turn, has spooked investors and contributed to the sell-off in Japanese stocks.\n\nAnother factor that has weighed on the Nikkei is the global economic slowdown, particularly in the United States. Recent data has shown a significant slowdown in U.S. economic growth, with the labor market cooling off and consumer spending weakening. This has raised concerns about a potential recession in the world's largest economy, which would have far-reaching consequences for global markets, including Japan.\n\nThe impact of the Nikkei's decline has been felt across the financial markets, with global stocks and currencies experiencing sharp declines. The U.S. dollar has weakened against the yen, while the euro and other major currencies have also come under pressure. The sell-off has also spilled over into other Asian markets, with the Shanghai Composite Index and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong also experiencing significant losses.\n\nThe sharp decline in the Nikkei has raised concerns about the broader health of the Japanese economy. Despite the government's efforts to stimulate growth through various measures, such as increased public spending and monetary easing, the economy has struggled to maintain momentum. The aging population, declining birth rates, and high levels of public debt have all contributed to Japan's economic challenges.\n\nThe BoJ's recent rate hike and the subsequent market turmoil have also highlighted the delicate balance that central banks must strike between managing inflation and supporting economic growth. While the BoJ's decision was aimed at stabilizing the yen and curbing inflation, it has had unintended consequences for the stock market and the broader economy.\n\nLooking ahead, the Japanese government and the BoJ will need to carefully consider their next steps to address the current market turmoil and support the economy. This may involve further stimulus measures, such as increased public spending or additional monetary easing. However, such measures could also lead to further weakening of the yen and exacerbate inflationary pressures.\n\nIn conclusion, Japan's Nikkei 225 index has recorded its worst single-day point drop in history, sending shockwaves through the financial markets and raising concerns about the stability of the Japanese economy. The decline has been driven by a combination of factors, including the BoJ's recent rate hike, the global economic slowdown, and the challenges facing the Japanese economy. The government and the BoJ will need to carefully navigate these challenges to support the economy and restore investor confidence.", "source": {"uri": "bbntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbntimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anas_bouargane@bbntimes.com", "name": "Anas Bouargane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unintended consequences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Seng_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hang Seng Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE_Composite_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SSE Composite Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bbntimes.com/images/articles/society/Japans_Nikkei_225_Index_Records_Worst_Single-Day_Drop_in_History.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790421", "eventUri": "eng-9790421", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-08-", "textStart": 120, "textEnd": 129}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-", "textStart": 305, "textEnd": 315}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

September following recent weak economic data.\n\nIn the Tokyo forex market, the Japanese yen on Monday strengthened to a seven-month-high, briefly reaching the upper 142-yen level against the U.S. dollar, which further dragged export-related issues.\n\nSell-offs of technology shares were also prevailing in the market amid heightened risk-off sentiment after the tech-heavy Nasdaq and a key semiconductor index fell sharply on Friday, according to analysts.\n\nCiting the Monday meltdown, some analysts here pointed out that Tokyo seems to have been suffering a worse-than-expected spillover from U.S. recession fears compared to other markets. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The report followed a historic decision earlier in the week by the Bank of Japan which increased interest rates to 0.25 percent, the first significant rate hike since the global financial crisis of 2008. Added to that the Middle East is bracing for an all-out regional war which could extend with the U.S. dispatching warships and troops to the region, and most countries advising citizens to leave Lebanon and Israel. Israel last week astonishingly assassinated the lead negotiator in the drawn-out hostage talks just as a ceasefire deal appeared imminent. Adding to the intensity of the incident it was carried out in Iran, and according to a New York Times report involved the planting of an explosive device in a residence used by the negotiator, Ismail Haniyeh. In other words the assassination was a terrorist attack. Israel has neither confirmed or denied it was responsible.\n\nOn Friday the Japanese yen jumped sharply, and Monday those gains were added to with vigour, as short-covering spread around the world. With stock prices peaking, particularly in the U.S. where records were being set daily for certain periods in recent weeks, the tide has turned. Many investors it seems were buying on credit with loans denominated in extraordinarily low yielding currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc. With the dramatic increase in the yen exchange rate, the carry-trade, as it is known, began to unwind. By Monday it was shattering with the yen soaring, and dragging along the Swiss franc, sending stock prices plunging further.\n\nThe Bank of Japan which was suspected to have been intervening as the yen sank towards 162 to the U.S. dollar, is believed to now be sitting on huge gains, and at the same time it appears to have achieved its objective of stopping the weakness, and restoring strength to the country's currency.\n\nThe sell-off in stocks, already a global snowball by late last week, gathered momentum on Monday as the contagion spread. In South Korea circuit-breakers disrupted trading to stem the falls, while in Taiwan the day's loss hit a record. European stock markets as they open are being swamped by sellers. U.S. stocks, based on futures trading are expected to tank when they open.\n\nThe Japanese yen and Swiss aside from the unwinding of the carry-trade are also benefiting from the dramatically changing geopolitical situation as the world is on edge over an anticipated retaliatory attack by Iran on Israel in response to the Haniyeh assassination on it soil.\n\nAround the close of trading in Tokyo on Monday the yen was fetching 143.28 to the dollar, while the Swiss franc was changing hands at 0.8511.\n\nIn Seoul, the Kospi Composite ended down 234.64 points or 9.77 percent at 2,441.55.\n\nIn Taipei, Taiwan, the TSEC Weighted index (TWII) plummeted 1,807.21 points or 8.35 percent to 19,830.88.\n\nIn Sydney, the Australian All Ordinaries close down 311.00 points or 3.81 percent at 7,859.40, while the Australian dollar slid to 0.6440.\n\nIn New Zealand, the S&P/NZX 50 loss 188.55 points or 1.51 percent.

Mint looks at the reasons behind the global 'stockocalypse':\n\nGlobal markets were in a sea of red, led by Japan, where the benchmark Nikkei tumbled 12.40%, marking its largest one-day fall since 'Black Monday' in October 1987. The broader Topix index crashed 12.48%. Such was the intensity of the selloff that circuit breakers temporarily halted trading of futures for the Topix as well as the Nikkei 225. Trading was also suspended for the Kospi and Kosdaq cash and futures markets in South Korea. European markets too retreated under selling pressure. In India, the Sensex crashed over 2,200 points, wiping off \u20b915 trillion in investors' wealth.\n\nExperts attribute this to the unwinding of the yen carry trade. A carry trade is a widely popular trading strategy in which an investor borrows from a country with low interest rates and a weaker currency and invests the money in the assets of a country with a higher rate of return. The yen is one of the most widely used currencies for this purpose as Japan has been maintaining a zero-interest rate regime for over two decades. The gush of funds from Japan has been a major source of liquidity for equity markets around the world.\n\nLast week, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates for the second time this year to 0.25%, apart from announcing a bond tapering plan. Additionally, it left the door open for further rate hikes this year. This has led to the yen strengthening against the US dollar. A strong domestic currency coupled with rising interest rates in Japan is making the yen carry trade unprofitable for investors.\n\nGlobal markets are also fretting over the US tipping into recession after its unemployment rate spiked to 4.3%, stoking fears that the Federal Reserve has fallen behind the curve in its policy support. However, this raises the chances of a Fed rate cut next month. Treasury bonds are seeing safe-haven demand, with US 10-year yields hitting 3.723%, the lowest since mid-2023. Geopolitical tensions have also ratcheted up over fears of Israel engaging in a multi-front war against Iran and its proxies. Any direct involvement of the US is also being keenly watched.\n\nDalal Street can expect intense spells of volatility, in tandem with other major markets, in case of a prolonged unwinding of the yen carry trade. Japan is among the top 10 equity market investors in India. Assets under custody of Japanese foreign portfolio investors stood at \u20b92.05 trillion at the end of June, as per data from India's National Securities Depository Ltd. While the growing muscle of domestic institutional investors will ensure a cushion for the stock markets, a deepening global risk-off sentiment can be detrimental for liquidity. This can also put pressure on the rupee, which was the second-worst performing currency in Asia last month.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors":

Data showed the US jobs market weakening, which triggered a closely watched recession indicator.\n\n\"This sell off is more of a short term volatility by way of profit booking and is no indicator of any long term panic mode set in the Indian equities. For investors looking at entering the equity market, a staggered entry during volatile periods can be considered,\" said Tanvi Kanchan, Head - UAE Business & Strategy, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.\n\nThe repercussions were witnessed in markets across the globe - from Asian equity markets, to currency markets to bitcoin prices. Here's a look at global markets:\n\nInvestors lost nearly \u20b915 lakh crore in a session amid the stock market crash today as the overall market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies dropped to nearly \u20b9442 lakh crore from nearly \u20b9457 lakh crore in the previous session.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index plunged 12.40%, or 4,451.28 points, to 31,458.42 -- its largest points drop in history -- while the broader Topix index declined 12.23%, or 310.45 points, to 2,227.15.\n\nA resurgent yen weighed on the Japanese stock markets. The yen surged to 141.73 against the dollar, a level not seen since early January, from 146.52 yen in New York on Friday.\n\nAmong other Asian markets, South Korea's Kospi plunged 8.1% before trading was halted for 20 minutes due to the exchange's circuit breakers. The Kosdaq dropped 11.71%.\n\nTaiwan's benchmark, Taiwan Weighted Index declined more than 8% amid selling in technology and real estate stocks. Hong Kong Hang Seng index fell 1.61%, while mainland China's CSI 300 declined 0.48%.\n\nThe domestic benchmark 10-year yield was at 6.8597%, lowest level since March 31, 2022, compared with its previous close of 6.8945%.\n\nUS Treasury yields nosedived on Friday. The US 10-year yield dropped to the lowest level since December and extended decline in Asian hours on Monday, Reuters reported. It was last at 6.7565% in Asian hours, while the 2-year yield was at 3.8216%.\n\nJapanese yen, a safe-haven and carry-funding favourite, traded at 143, up 2.3% versus the dollar, and at levels last seen on January 2, Reuters reported. The yen has rallied 10% against the dollar in just over three weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.\n\nTop token Bitcoin price traded 15.5% lower at $51,323.58, adding to a 13.1% drop last week that was the worst since the period when the FTX exchange imploded. Ethereum price declined 22.3% to $2,262. Most other major cryptocurrencies were deeply in the red.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ankit_gohel@livemint.com", "name": "Ankit

The Chinese stock markets have been under pressure this year due to the country's economic troubles.\n\nInvestors are also on edge before the US markets open later in the global day. S&P 500 futures were down 2.3% at 12:46 p.m. ET, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 0.9% lower. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 4.7%.\n\nBitcoin fell 13% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe negativity in US stocks ahead of the week's opening came after a recent selloff in tech stocks as euphoria over artificial intelligence fizzled, with investors questioning when they would be seeing returns.\n\nA weak July jobs report from the US added to investor gloom, sparking a selloff in US stocks on Friday, just days after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady again.\n\nBut it's not just the US economy and the Fed that is weighing on the markets. It's also about Japan's interest-rate hike last Wednesday.\n\nThe Bank of Japan raised its interest rate from between 0% and 0.1% to 0.25% on Wednesday -- the highest level in 15 years.\n\nEven though it appears tiny, it matters because the Japanese yen has been the focus of carry trade, where traders profit from a divergence in interest rates across the world. Since the turnover in global foreign exchange markets is massive -- it reached a record $7.5 trillion per day in April 2022, according to a triennial survey -- the fallout can be huge.\n\nJapan kept interest rates ultra-low for decades following the implosion of an asset bubble in the 1990s that contributed to persistent deflation. It continued holding rates low after the pandemic, in contrast to other major central banks that started hiking them.\n\nThis created a divergence in monetary policy that impacted the Japanese yen, which sank to a near four-decade-low against the strong US dollar last month.\n\nThis divergence helped carry trade, which, as ING analysts explained on Monday, has been a dominant successful investment strategy this year.\n\nIt involves \"borrowing cheaply in yen -- on the expectation that the yen will continue to fall -- and investing in some high-yielding currency or asset preferably backed by a strong macro argument,\" the ING analysts added.\n\nHowever, this strategy is now hit with a hitch, as the BOJ's rate hike last week sent the yen up -- it's 7.5% higher over the last five trading days and is 1.6% lower against the dollar so far this year.\n\nThe hike has also fanned further risk-off sentiment in global stock markets.\n\n\"The unwinding of yen shorts is undoubtedly contributing to the global risk-off environment,\" wrote ING analysts in a separate July 25 note.\n\nThere are still be choppy waters ahead, particularly for risk assets, warned Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Bank's chief economist of Asia excluding Japan on Friday.\n\n\"The dark clouds of adverse feedback loop between 'carry' liquidation and 'risk off' contagion cannot be ignored,\" he added.",

The broader Topix index also saw a sharp decline, falling 6.6% to 2,370.18. This nosedive comes amid a strengthening yen, which traded at 145.43 JPY per dollar, up 0.8% and having risen 10% against the dollar in just over three weeks. Driving this is the Bank of Japan's interest rate increase and the unwinding of yen-funded carry trades. Contributing to the market turmoil were consecutive selloffs in US stocks, particularly the Nasdaq Composite entering correction territory following a soft jobs report. This has sparked fears of a US recession and expectations for a significant Federal Reserve rate cut in September.\n\nThe current selloff has resulted in major repercussions across the Tokyo Stock Exchange, highlighted by a significant 8.4% drop in Tokyo Electron, a critical player in chip-making equipment. Fast Retailing, owner of the popular Uniqlo brand, fell by 4%, while technology investor SoftBank Group dropped 6.9%. The banking sector in Japan took an even more substantial hit, plummeting 12% and marking it the worst-performing sector among the exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes. The appreciation of the yen, fueled by both the BoJ's rate hike and the unwinding of yen-funded carry trades, continues to pressure global markets, hinting at further volatility.\n\nThe bigger picture: A storm of economic uncertainty.\n\nInvestors are jittery as the potential for a US recession casts a long shadow on global markets. The strengthening yen, traditionally seen as a safe haven, is a double-edged sword: while it offers stability amid turmoil, it also indicates troubling economic signals, such as the unwinding of investments previously buoyed by cheap yen funding.

Poor US jobs data and recession fears spooked investors, while the yen surged to a 7-month high against the dollar, climbing 2.5% to 142.96 per dollar, up 14% in less than a month. This was partly due to the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike and the unwinding of yen-funded carry trades. By the close, the Nikkei had entered bear market territory, down 27% from its July peak, wiping out 113 trillion yen ($792.32 billion) in market value.\n\nThe Nikkei's fall wasn't isolated.

Such a scenario bodes poorly for the dollar, and portends some strength in Asian currencies.\n\nBut weak risk appetite saw most Asian units soften on Monday. The Australian dollar's AUDUSD pair fell 0.2% before a Reserve Bank meeting on Tuesday, where the central bank is widely expected to keep rates unchanged following recent data that showed inflation was cooling slightly.\n\nThe Chinese yuan's USDCNY pair fell 0.3% to a six-month low, with a bulk of the strength coming from a stronger-than-expected midpoint fix by the PBOC. The central bank was also seen intervening in currency markets in July, as a string of weak readings on China's economy battered the yuan.\n\nBut private PMI data on Monday showed some resilience in the country's services sector.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Bank_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "People's Bank of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEC3L0Q0_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790421", "eventUri": "eng-9790421", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The Japanese \"Carry-Trade\" Fully EXPLAINED * 100PercentFedUp.com * by Noah", "body": "As I write this, it's very early on Monday morning and the financial meltdown is only getting worse.\n\nI warned last night that we might be in for a \"Black Monday\" and so far that is unfortunately looking like it may be true.\n\nBut what's causing this?\n\nYou may have heard a lot about the Japanese Carry-Trade but maybe you don't fully understand what that means?\n\nPeople are saying this is the likely cause of the sudden financial meltdown, so what is the Japanese Carry-Trade and why is it suddenly ruining everything?\n\nOnce again, my friend MeetKevin (Kevin Paffrath) gives the absolute best explanation of what this is that I have found from anyone so I wanted to pass it along to you.\n\nWatch the video below or scroll down for the full transcript and I think it will make a lot of sense.\n\nWhy are markets absolutely collapsing? What is this Japanese carry trade we're going to talk about? We're going to explain it in this video so you fully understand the Japanese carry trade that everybody keeps talking about and why Japan could be leading markets to crash in America.\n\nOf course, it could also be that we are now under an imminent threat of an Iranian and Hezbollah-led attack against Israel, which threatens to be larger than anything Israel has ever seen before. With Israel now warning that Israelis could be without power for 3 days as they face a multi-pronged attack expected to begin within the next 24 hours, if not tonight then tomorrow night. Just a crazy world that we're in.\n\nOr is it just that the US might be going into a recession? Or D, all of the above? Well, in this video we're going to start by talking about the Japanese carry trade and trying to explain it.\n\nNow let's be clear right at the start. The Japanese stock market ain't doing too well. Just in the last 12 hours, the Japanese market -- well, let's just put it this way -- their TOPIX index circuit breaker hit, no more trading for a period of time. Bond market circuit breaker hit, no more trading for a period of time. South Korea, in sympathy for what's going on in Japan, just decided, you know what, nobody's allowed to sell after the KOSPI's down 4.6%. Zoom in on Japan for a moment, NIKKEI down over 65%, the NIKKEI 225. Nintendo stocks down 11.3%. But who cares about Nintendo? What are the banks doing in Japan? Oh, the second largest bank in the country down 15.5%. The largest bank in the country, like the equivalent of a JP Morgan, down 12.2%.\n\nWell, at least gold's up. Real gold, not digital gold because Bitcoin's down 11%, Ether down 21% in the overnight trading. On the app Robinhood, you could look at Tesla down 6%, Apple down 6.9%, Nvidia down 6.75%, and all futures are red, led by, no joke, small caps and NASDAQ 100. You've got the S&P down 1.42%, Dow futures also down 0.77%.\n\nSo, this is just a quick little rundown on what the heck is going on here. This is a lot of pain. Why? What is going on? Well, let's start with the carry trade failure. Let's explain this.\n\nSo, everybody knows that the entire world has been facing a lot of inflation except for Japan. They've basically stagnated since the '90s and they've faced issues of too much deflation. Maybe they're not having enough babies, maybe they're not having enough innovation, who knows. But they did not have the inflation problem of the rest of the world. This meant that while Japan was actually lowering rates and had negative interest rates, everyone else was raising interest rates. Now, this does something very interesting because when interest rates go up in, let's say, the United States, it becomes more attractive to buy the 10-year Treasury bond.\n\nSo, for example, if the 10-year Treasury is trading for 3.76%, just like it is now, and the Japanese 10-year is trading for 0.82%, which bond would you rather have? The 10-year debt paying you 3.7% guaranteed and backed by the full faith and credit of the US, or the Japanese 10-year paying you just 0.82%? It's a no-brainer, an absolute no-brainer. You're going to buy the US bond and if you have any other currency, you're going to sell that other currency, you're going to go buy US dollars, and you're going to go invest in that US bond. This creates a lot of selling pressure on currencies like the Japanese yen. So, the Japanese yen goes down in value, which enables something unique called the carry trade.\n\nOkay, now you're going to have to roll with me on this one because it's a little complicated, but I'm going to make it as simple as possible. Here's an example of what a carry trade looks like. Let's just start extremely simple. Let's just say right now you want to take on a margin loan on stocks in America. It might cost you 6.5% in the US, but what if you could go to Japan and in Japan you could borrow at 1.5%? Oh, well that's a lot more desirable. Why don't I go borrow in Japan and then go invest that money in either US Treasuries, which are literally yielding more than what I'm paying on my debt, or how about MAG 6 stock, or MAG 7 stocks, whatever you want, right? The biggest stocks in America, buy some Nvidia, buy some Tesla, whatever. This is essentially an arbitrage of interest rates. That's what this all comes down to.\n\nNow, how does this go wrong? Well, first of all, to understand how it goes wrong, let's understand how it goes right. Let's say I borrow oodles and boodles of money in Japan, and just to make math simple right now, we're just going to call it $1,000 worth of yen. I'm going to take that money and I'm going to use it to go buy US assets. Well, if the Japanese yen keeps going down in value, it's actually going to be a lot cheaper for me to pay off that money. Like, let's say I take that $1,000 and I put it into US Treasuries over here. Well, every single year I'm getting my 3 or 5% yield on money markets or Treasuries, maybe even a little bit more. So, let's say over here I've all of a sudden after a year got 1,050 bucks and the Japanese yen fell 20% in value, so I actually only have to pay back $800 worth of yen over here. This is great. I picked up 50 bucks very cheaply in America, so I'm plus 50 over here, and I can now pay that yen back with $200 fewer dollars. So, I pick up $200 over here. Let's go, baby! I just made 250 bucks, 25%. Chaching! Investing on the fact that the Japanese yen is going down. And guess what? The Japanese yen usually goes down. It's just kind of unfortunately the way it's worked.\n\nSo, for example, if you pull up the US to Japanese yen valuation over here, you can see there are very rare cases where the Japanese yen spikes. Once over here in '95, over here in 2011, you can see over here the yen's actually been plummeting, so it's actually made the carry trade more desirable. I mean, you've dropped 27% in the value of the yen. So, that example I just gave on the iPad over here, this has been printing money. It's been absolutely minting, minting, minting. Yeah, let me close this door. I hear the children again. Hold on a sec. Double doors for soundproofing, let's close this stuff. Anyway, so you've been printing money doing this carry trade because the Japanese yen just goes down, down, down. So, people keep adding to their bets, adding to their bets, adding to their bets, adding to the bets. Okay, cool, like you're winning. That's wonderful.\n\nLike, Kevin, what's wrong with this? Ah, yes, yes, there has to be a downside to any trade, right? Of course there is. So, let's say you decided to take your $1,000 over in Japan. So, you're going to borrow $1,000 worth of Japanese yen, okay? So, we take our $1,000 over here, $1,000 worth of Japanese yen, and now what we're going to do is we're going to invest that into the dip on Tesla, okay? And let's just say we bought Tesla just for giggles because this could be anything, okay? You're like, man, Tesla's going to the moon, baby. I'm going to buy it at 270. And then of course, you know, Elon rug pulls you and delays the robo-taxi event, whatever. Okay, you know, put any placeholder there. This is not a Tesla video. This could be anything. It could be Nvidia, the darn thing's down like 25% from its peak. You know, it could be Tesla, obviously, you're going to be down about 30% or it does not matter what it is, or you have a leveraged position. It doesn't matter what it is.\n\nLet's go with you buy Tesla at 270. Okay, you know what? Forget even what price it is. You just put $1,000 into Tesla stock right here because you borrowed $1,000 worth of yen. You put it all into Tesla stock. But wait a minute, if you put $1,000 into a broker in America, why are you just going to use $1,000? Come on, man. Reg T margin, 50% down. I get to buy $2,000 of Tesla with $1,000 of a deposit, right? That is a typical margin loan in America. So, now I borrowed the money cheap over here. The money that I borrowed very cheaply in Japan, I'm now going to leverage again in the US stock market. But why does this matter? I mean, the Japanese currency keeps devaluing, everything should be fine.\n\nOh, but wait, then all of a sudden Japan says, hey, look everyone, we finally got inflation. Let's raise interest rates because inflation is finally moving up. Uh, what? Yes, this is exactly what Japan did last week. They raised interest rates 25 basis points and they were already at positive, so they just went up another 25 BPS. And what happens when countries raise their interest rates? That's right, their bonds become more desirable, especially since Japan is now going up and everybody else is cutting. So, you're getting more of a yield in Japan. So, what all of a sudden happens to the value of the US dollar when yields go down? Oh, the dollar goes down, the Japanese yen goes up, which exacerbates the spread because you're going in both directions. And so, oh, over the last month, so over the last 30 days, the Japanese yen has appreciated 10%. Oh, but wait a minute, I borrowed $1,000 worth of yen over here. How many dollars do I need now to repay that loan in Japan? Well, now because it's 10% more expensive, I need $1,100 to repay my loan in Japan. No problem, no problem. What's my Tesla stock doing? Oh God, it's down 30% and I'm on margin. Oh, okay. So, just to make math a little fun here, actually, the example I did is I went with 35%. So, let's assume it's down 35%. That's down $700 on $2,000. So, that means all of a sudden I have $1,300 left over here. But wait a minute, I'm such a dgen, I also borrowed over here, so I actually only have $300 of equity. $300 of equity out of the $2,000 of stock I bought is 15%. Oh, who's that calling? Oh, it's Mr. Margin calling. And now you get liquidated. Sure, you get your $300 back, but you got liquidated, which contributes to more selling pressure in the United States. Oh no, but wait a minute, bro. Now I only have $300 left and I have to pay an $1,100 loan off in Japan. And now Japan is going, hey bro, margin's calling. And you're like, what? Why? Because sir, you have $300 of collateral left on the $1,100 loan you just took out because we could see what you did with your money. We want our money back. You're at margin levels. And you're like, okay, guess I'm filing BK and getting hosed. Boom, now you have to either borrow more from somewhere else to pay off that $1,100 loan or you're defaulting and you're destroying the banks. Which now it totally makes sense why the banks are collapsing in Japan. Well, their stock valuations are collapsing because they are getting burned over here on their debt as well. So, they burn us in our stock market and they get burned in the banks over there. Now, how big is this trade? Well, nobody really knows. Cathie Wood thinks it could be as much as 10% of the United States stock market. That's massive. Like as much as $1 trillion of leverage in all risk assets, risk assets, crypto stocks, doesn't matter.\n\nOkay, this is always funny because I talk about this in my course member live streams and people are like, oh, you know, sometimes people are like, oh, but Kev, crypto is not a risk asset. Like it is the definition of a risk asset. Why do you think gold is up and Bitcoin's down 11% right now? Your boy Kevin, by the way, uh, let's just say this is not an advertisement or anything, but I've been talking about this for a couple weeks now since probably since about July 11th, like everything really hit the fan. But, um, on the fund I manage, we're like 5% short Bitcoin. I wish I had more short Bitcoin right now because that's going to do really freaking well tomorrow. Remember, if you want any of my buy/sell alerts or anything, meetkevin.com. You can learn everything in the courses I'm building here with you. You should be part of the course member live streams because we talk about this kind of stuff on a daily basis or even chat in our Discord server. Uh, but anyway, what is next? Well, maybe Japan can just print more money, right? And they could sort of solve this issue, right? Well, so far, the Japanese cabinet is saying they're watching market moves with a sense of urgency and, uh, don't worry, share prices are determined by a variety of forces and, um, yeah, we're just going to keep watching. That doesn't really inspire a lot of confidence.\n\nSo what about the money printing part, Kevin? Like, when are they just going to turn the printer on again and make all this pain go away? Ah, okay, well, in order to understand that, we have to consider what Japan's debt to GDP is and compare it to where everybody else is in the rest of the world. So we have a lot of debt in the United States. We know a little over 100% here. Japan's debt to GDP sits around 263%. That is higher than Venezuela and it takes the number one spot for being the most indebted country in the world as it compares to GDP. That's pretty pathetic. So I don't think they're turning on the money printer anytime soon because they freaking can't.\n\nAdd to this the fact that an attack by Iran is likely imminent and add to this that people are pricing in recession fears in America and you've got a whole heck of a lot of uncertainty. Now, does that necessarily mean that the United States stock market is going to sell off on Monday? Well, the futures market says so, but that was during the Japanese stock market open. Maybe cooler heads will prevail and everything will be hunky dory in the morning. Everything will start going up again, we'll have a nice little rebound and maybe we'll open up to just a little buy the dip opportunity and nothing else to see here. Everything's fine. Or things will completely panic and everybody will take every opportunity at a bounce just to sell more stock because this is a sinking ship and everybody sees the exit over there.\n\nWell, according to a poll I ran on X, the latter doesn't seem to be the big priority. In fact, according to a poll I ran on X, which you should follow me there at real Meet Kevin with 6,761 results, 44.6% of you said yes, Kevin, buy the dip, 34.3% of you said I'm holding, and only 21.2% of you suggested that you were selling. Also, when I suggested that Bitcoin might be a risk asset, somebody replied to me and said, but Kevin, they're investing in Bitcoin for the tech, right? That's going to help save you in these market moves. It won't.\n\nAnyway, so I'm curious, what do you all think? What are you all going to do? I will make the argument that probably the safest investment right now is cash followed by Treasury bonds, which might continue to collapse in yields. Now you might be thinking, oh, but Kevin, the Federal Reserve is going to come bail us out, right? Well, this is where you have to ask yourself, what does the Fed care more about, avoiding recession or avoiding inflation? See, I ran that poll as well, and the vast majority of people said, oh, the Fed wants to avoid a recession. And to that I say, you're wrong. The Fed cares way more about destroying inflation because inflation ends countries. Recessions are healthy. So buckle up. The Fed ain't coming to bail you out anytime soon.\n\nNow, if you want to know exactly what I'm trading, make sure you're part of those courses over at meetkevin.com.

Having success.\n\nSo I tend to listen to what he says, and the bad news is he's EXTREMELY bearish on the stock market right now.\n\nAnd this is not a guy who typically is bearish.\n\nBy his own admission, he finds going against \"Trade America\" to be very difficult.\n\nIn other words, most of the time he's bullish on the future of America.\n\nThat video has proven to be very prescient already.\n\nOn Friday, Gold surged to a new All Time High, as the stock market wiped out BILLIONS of dollars in one extremely bloody, red day.\n\nThat's why he just released this update video where he confirms how bad things are about to get. Be sure to notice what he says about Gold and Silver:\n\nFULL TRANSCRIPT HERE:\n\nWell, folks, bad news. We might officially be in a recession. We need to talk about why in this video. We need to talk about when markets bottom because there's a lot of information out there, and you kind of have to pick which side to follow on this one. We're also going to talk about how to prepare yourself for all this.\n\nFirst things first, you probably already heard about the job numbers this morning. I don't want to reiterate the nonsense. What matters most is that this jobs report was 2.6 standard deviations off expectation, which has now triggered the S rule. The S rule being triggered is a recessionary indicator. The St. Louis Federal Reserve literally calls it the Realtime Som Rule Recession Indicator. Once it crosses over 0.5, boom, you might already be in a recession.\n\nIn fact, when you go back and look, 1960s, boom, you're in a recession when it crossed 0.5. Over here, boom, 70s, you're in a recession when it crossed 0.5. Over here, didn't cross 0.5, no recession. Over here, crossed 0.5, recession. Over here, hit 0.5, didn't exceed 0.5, no recession. Over here, you pass 0.5, recession. Pass 0.5, recession. What do you have over here? 33, no recession. No recession, 0.5, recession. Get where I'm going with this, right? Every time it goes over 0.5, recession. Look at where it is right now.\n\nNow, it's not a hard and fast rule, it does not mean with certainty that we are in a recession, but it is quite likely that we have just entered a recession. Some people are going to say, \"Oh, but Kevin, it was the hurricane. It's the hurricane. That's why the job numbers came in low.\" Okay, then what's important to know now is that if we are in a recession, when does the market bottom? That's the big question.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, if you average all of these prior recession indicators, the market bottoms when the S rule triggers. Oh my gosh, that means right now, buy the dip! Hold on, not so fast. I like to look at 2000 and 2008. I take out COVID, and I wanted to see what happened when the S rule was triggered at these levels because, in my opinion, they much more associate with not a run-of-the-mill recession, but rather an insane bubble of some form. The dot-com bubble, the housing bubble, and now the AI bubble.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna say it. Do I think there's an AI bubble? Yes. I've been complaining about this for a very long time now, and what I found when the S rule was triggered here was very different from what Bloomberg said. And that's my goal on this channel, to always provide you with perspectives that at least challenge some of the mainstream perspectives out there. So you get different perspectives, so you can ask yourself, \"Do I agree with Kevin, or do I agree with Bloomberg?\" I'm going to give you both sides, and then you can decide. You don't have to pick my side.\n\nNow, we did very well in the last, I mean, frankly, today. Today did very well. Yesterday, I was dumb. I had some AMD calls, I got burned on that. We already talked about getting burned yesterday, but I made more than that burnage back today because my shorts made some really nice dollar hollas. I threw in an IBKR order, the IBKR order doubled my account on IBKR. I rarely trade on there. My Robinhood account, I doubled this week because I threw puts in there as well. I rarely trade in there as well. And then my P&L for today is glorious, 203%. So, I mean, you could see this. This is, you know, $400, $450,000 in tendies just in the last 24 hours because I have been bearish since July 11th. I didn't play it perfectly over the last three weeks, but if you want all my buy-sell alerts just to get my perspective and my discussions in the course member live streams, remember we did extend the coupon code to the end of the day today. We wanted to get through the jobs catalyst. Some people were asking about getting through the jobs catalyst. Here it is. So, meetkevin.com to join. You pay once, you're in forever. Price guaranteed to be the lowest you can ever get, otherwise your money back.\n\nTake a look at this, folks. June 2001, the S rule triggers. Write that down. June 2001, 0.53. That's where we sit today. Now write this down. April 2008 to May 2008, Som rule triggers. Write that down. Why does that matter? Because it took a little bit longer for the market to actually bottom out in those cycles. It took 15 to 20 months to bottom out after the S rule triggered in 2001, another asset bubble. It took 9 to 10 months to bottom out after the 2008 trigger, another asset bubble. In other words, we could be at the beginning of this sell-off. Now, does that mean the market's going to go straight down? Absolutely not. The market will, in my opinion, absolutely not go straight down. In fact, it will just slowly bleed every day.\n\nYou're going to get those people who post, \"Oh look, Kevin, today the stock is up, see you were wrong.\" I literally had a financial guy, a financial money manager, when I said, \"Why would you go long small caps right now? That is the worst thing to own in a recession.\" I literally had a financial adviser, and I won't put him on blast. And I'll tell you why, two reasons. I won't put him on blast, but on X, @realmeetkevin, he replies to me, goes, \"Oh, okay, Kevin, I think you're going to be wrong.\" The very next day, IWM's like up 1.5%, small caps. He's like, \"See, Kevin was wrong, Tom Lee is right again. Tom Lee is always right.\" Now look, I'm not here to declare victory right now, but if you look right now, to me it looks like investing in IWM was a bad idea. That's what it looks like right now, and I think frankly it's just getting started. Because if we are triggering a recession warning, the stupidest thing to own are small caps because they're the ones that are going to go bankrupt. You would be better off buying the dip on Nvidia, which I think is a bubble risk. You'd be better off buying the dip on Amazon as the next Walmart than you would be buying the dip on the Russell, where you're going to have a bunch of bankruptcies weighing this sucker down. No way, Jose.\n\nAnyway, as a result of this sort of tiff, the reason I don't want to put that person on blast for critiquing me that very next day is because he ended up deleting his post, so I couldn't find it again. And I didn't even say anything. I'm not like prancing around trying to declare victory today. I didn't even say anything, but all of a sudden I'm like, \"I wonder what Tom Lee's saying today.\" I wasn't even going to say anything. I was not even going to say anything, and this is what I get. I got a thank you card in the mail from Tom Lee. There it is on the screen right there.\n\nAnyway, listen, the Greed and Fear Index is something that we need to pay very close attention to, folks. Yesterday we were at 40, 39. Today we're at 26. This is probably going to keep going. Why? Because market momentum probably has to go below the 125-day moving average, and stock price strength needs to move out of extreme greed. You need all of this to be fear, fear, fear. We're not there yet. The VIX skyrocketed. Safe haven demand skyrocketed. Junk bond yields have skyrocketed. We're about to re-invert on the yield curve. Now, understand what that usually signals. When the difference between the 2-year and the 10-year goes positive again after having been inverted, it usually means you have begun a recession. We are currently 9.9 basis points inverted. We are 9 basis points spread away from once again triggering a recession with now a second indicator. Not there yet. So far, it's just the S rule. This is not good.\n\nNow, I also want you to remember, there's a very, very key signal that we saw this morning. This morning, Jim Cramer was asked, \"Are we going into a recession?\" And Jim Cramer said, \"No, of course not.\" I'm very nervous. JP Morgan and Citigroup are all increasing their odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Nick T, also famously considered Nicky Leaks, believes that a lot of institutions are now ramping up their interest rate cut projections, and I'd like to tell you something. I think they're all wrong. These numbers are all going to end up being too low over time. Now, do I think there's a likelihood of us getting a 50 BP in September? Folks, if the market continues to correct the way it is correcting now, we are going to get a lot more than a 50 basis point cut. The Federal Reserve will declare victory on inflation, and in order to preserve the jobs market, the Federal Reserve will cut rates back first to 2% and then to 0%. They will do so rapidly. They won't do so based on just today's jobs report. In fact, they're going to try to exercise restraint, and they will wait. They will wait, wait, wait, wait until unfortunately it's too late, and they'll have no choice but to cut rates back to zero.\n\nThat's when you're going to get a lot of folks who argue, \"Oh my gosh, this is going to set off a second wave of inflation.\" No, it's not, because everybody's going to be jobless. You're going to have manufacturing supply chains that are so freaking loose that you can't have inflation because nobody can raise prices, even in an environment of low interest rates, because nobody will be able to finance anything because a) they'll either have lost their jobs, or their hours will have gotten cut, or their salary will have gotten sliced.\n\nI talked about this today in my course member live stream. Listen, I'm not always right in my trades. I always make that clear. I'm not always right in my trades. I do not guarantee that you are going to make money. But what I do every single day is I show up, I try my best, and I give you perspective. And I'm going to give you a little spoiler alert of what I talked about to course members today. I said, \"Listen, if we don't go into recession, fantastic. But if you ask yourself right now, is now the time to buy the Cybertruck? Is now the time to YOLO all your money on new clothing, an expensive vacation, a home addition? Is now the time to put your family's future at risk, or is now the time to be cautious?\" My belief is the time is to be cautious. My belief is you should cut your expenses. My belief is you should pretend. You should go through an exercise with your family right now. \"What are we going to do if one of us loses our jobs? What are we going to do if my salary gets cut in half? What are we going to do if we both lose our jobs? What skill set do we have to get another job?\" What are we going to do?\n\nThose are the exercises to start thinking about now. Worst case scenario, you don't lose your job. No recession. Everything goes back to normal. Fine. Big deal. You cut expenses. You were safe. But what happens if you don't pre-plan for that and then you get rugged? Your boss calls you up and says, \"Hey, you were making $150K, $100K a year, $80K a year. Now you're making $100K or $50K. Don't like it? Bye. I got 20 other people willing to do the same work for that paycheck.\" This is a time to cut expenses. It is very, very, very scary. And look, there are going to be green days. This market will not fall off a cliff. I think, frankly, you could go into a 10-month bear market. Yikes.\n\nSo, you know, now people are speculating on, \"Okay, well, what's going to do well in a bear market?\" Well, potentially nothing. But if I had to guess, probably gold. If we do go into a recession, I hate saying it, but probably gold. McDonald's, I actually think Amazon will be a form of McDonald's. Like, I'd way rather be in Amazon than Nvidia. I'll take the AI play on Amazon, and I'll take that people are going to try to get the cheapest product possible on Amazon. They will be the dollar store you want to invest in because if you invest in the dollar stores, they could go bankrupt. I'm telling you, you come here for the perspective that you didn't even consider.\n\nJPow will probably commit to rate cuts at JHole. He kind of already did, but he'll probably recommit to cuts, maybe even 50 at JHole. So, maybe markets will bounce there. They will not go down in a straight line. So, I think you take your tendies when you can, and you reopen positions as you'd like. But what I'm looking at is when I look at a company like Amazon, I think they are going to be a company that will be the dollar store of the future. You go take them right now at $166. That's actually a fib retracement level. $166 divided by $557, they're trading for 29.8 times earnings. Now, you look at their forward growth, which could get skewed, obviously, these growth estimates could get skewed, especially if you're in a recession, but you're looking at growth of 19% + 18% + 26%, 78% + 13%, 39%. You're looking at growth of 77.9% over the next four years. I actually think it'll be greater than that. You're sitting at roughly a 1.5 PEG for a company that gives you AI exposure but is not purely part of the AI bubble. It didn't run up like all the other AI plays and could be the dollar store of the future. And Walmart is sitting at crazy excessive valuations. I don't know, I prefer Amazon, ironically, on the dip, and McDonald's on the dip.\n\nRemember my 2x2 foundation model? It's inspired by Rust. The 2x2 says you want to buy companies that do not have a bankruptcy risk. To me, that kills a lot of dollar stores already. A lot of them don't have the strongest balance sheets. You want Amazon and McDonald's. They're not going to go bankrupt in the cycle. I want valuation. McDonald's and Amazon mostly have that right now. Amazon certainly does. McDonald's is a little bit richer, but I'm okay with it. Sentiment and momentum. The sentiment on both of these is trash. I like buying when sentiment is trash on those companies. And pricing power. Both of these companies, both of these brands, have absolute pricing power. There is not a doubt in my mind about both of those companies.\n\nNow, would I hedge by being, you know, maybe short the Qs or short some AI? Of course. And again, we will bounce. We had a little bit of a bounce this morning. We'll probably bounce again next week. But the next four months, three months, going into the election, I don't want to be uber bull. I don't want to be an uber bull in this environment. Get me through the election, and I'll consider it. I'll consider it at that point, but not any earlier than that.\n\nSo, I really want folks to think about this not from the perspective of fear-mongering. We could bounce. We could rally again. That's okay. I'm all right, you know, sitting on the sidelines and enjoying. But what I want to know, you know, sort of just watching, cash, raise cash, you know, short to hedge your longs. That's the point, really hedging, right? But what I want to know is when's the market really going to bottom. I think the market bottoms either when we confirm a soft landing, which would be a very soft bottom. It would be a very blurry bottom, a very volatile bottom. Or when the Federal Reserve freaks out in full-on bailouts.\n\nThere were two cases that have happened previously in the past. One is when they joined the course member live streams themselves and said, \"We're going to the moon.\" Okay, that never happened. That was really just a sly pitch, probably relatively weak for me to remind you about the expiring coupon code today. One was actually February 10th of 2009 when the Federal Reserve released the following statement: \"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced it is prepared to undertake a substantial expansion of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. The expansion could increase the size of the TALF to as much as $1 trillion and could broaden eligible collateral to encompass other types of newly issued AAA-rated asset-backed securities such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, private label residential mortgage-backed securities, or other asset-backed securities.\" In other words, the massive QE1 that was actually authorized in November of 2008 under the Section 133 emergency lending program. This was announced in November of 2008. This wasn't enough. It took the Fed really panicking and going for a level of bailout they've never done before, and that's what you got in February of 2009. Look at when the stock market bottomed. February of 2009. How about March, when the Federal Reserve or February to March of 2009, or 2003 when you had your second double dip and the Federal Reserve basically gave the monetary policy and economic outlook commitment to Congress that they will stop at nothing to protect this economy and the market bottomed? That's the kind of Fed you need. They weren't yapping about a dual mandate of inflation. They talked about one mandate: we'll do whatever we need to bail this crap out. It's like when the Fed came out in March of 2020 and said, \"We will buy everything. Infinite bailout. We'll even buy stocks.\" That, my friends, is when the market bottoms. That is when you go shopping.\n\nI'm just going to keep doing my best. I'll be here every day. You know, I know people make fun of me. They call me a flip-flopper or whatever. In volatile times, it is challenging to be perfect. In fact, in any time, it's challenging to be perfect. And I don't confess to being perfect at all. I don't even confess to being good. I confess to being some dude on the internet who does his best and will share his perspective with you. And if you want that perspective in the form of course member live streams, meetkevin.com. If you want it in the form of these free videos, here you go. If you want it in the form of trade alerts, no guarantees we can make money. Obviously, today we had a phenomenal day. You know, up over $450K. It was a phenomenal day and made up for a stupid decision on AMD. You know, then you can get those.\n\nSo anyway, we'll see you there. Thank you so very much for being here. By the way, if you are a course member and you want to get free access to the market live chat so you can chat for free and you don't have to be a green chatter, you can get a wrench when you join. Just leave a comment on today's course member live stream and say, \"Please wrench me, bro.\" I will always wrench you. We'll see you in the next one. Thanks, folks. Bye.\n\nGood luck. These things that you told us here, I feel like nobody else knows about this. We'll try a little advertising and see how it goes. Congratulations, man. You have done so much. People love you.

Make sure if you're considering investing in House Hack to always read the PPM at househack.com.\n\nThere's a reason why I keep telling you this:\n\nBut I am a reporter and what I see happening with the banking system scares me a lot.\n\nThe first thing that scares me about keeping dollars in a bank account is how they lose value year over year.\n\nYou're literally losing money every year to inflation.\n\nYes, if you simply left $1 million in cash in the bank since 1913, do you know what it would be worth?\n\n$40,000.\n\nYour $1 million from 1913 would have the purchasing power in 2024 of $40,000.\n\nWhat scares me is another round of bank closures like we had last year.\n\nHere's what's happening in China right now:\n\nBREAKING: 40 Chinese Banks Just Crashed and Vanished -- \"Worse Than 1980 S&L Crisis!\"\n\nBut even if your bank is open, can you get the money out?\n\nHave you ever tried?\n\nSure you have to leave some money in there, but you don't want big amounts of money sitting in bank accounts.\n\nBecause you might never be able to get it out!\n\nGo ahead, test me out on this...even right now in good times (before a full-blown banking crisis hits America) go to your bank right now and try and withdraw $10,000. They will look at you with panicked looks on their face. I guarantee it. Then they'll go get their supervisor. The supervisor will come over and tell you they can't do that today. Come back in 2-3 days. And then they'll start the interrogation. \"What do you need this money for?\" \"Where is this money going?\" Only after you answer all their questions, wait 2-3 days, fill out a bunch of paperwork, only then will you MAYBE be allowed to take YOUR money out of YOUR account.\n\nHow do you make sure you and your family are not at risk when the banking crisis hits America (which I believe it will, very soon).\n\nThe answer is you do exactly what I've been preaching about for over a year now....get your money OUT of the banks! (Not personalized financial advice, just common sense from where I sit). That's Step #1.\n\nHold firm, be determined, play their stupid games, and get your money out of the banks!\n\nBecause while YOU view it as your money in your bank account, that's not how the bank views it. The bank views it as their money. And the dirty little secret is they LENT OUT your money to other people already. Sometimes 9-10 times over! It's true, I'll do a separate report soon on that explaining \"fractional reserve banking\".\n\nBut Step #2 is the most critical....you don't want to just get your money out of the banks, you want to get it out of the US Dollar.\n\nThe most basic and traditional financial wisdom has always viewed Precious Metals (Gold and Silver) as the safest places to have your money when a crisis hits.\n\nSo while I can't give you personalized financial advice, I can tell you a couple things: (1) the Big Central Banks have all been buying Gold and Silver hand over fist for the last couple years. Gee, I wonder why? And (2) Gold and Silver have stood the test of time back to the Bible times as being the best store of wealth to weather out a storm in the economy. Period.\n\nAnd now Step #3 is where I'm going to make sure I don't leave you hanging.\n\nI have two killer connections for you...\n\nTwo companies that I trust for getting the best deals on Gold and Silver. PHYSICAL Gold and Silver, the real stuff. Not some phony symbol traded on some stock exchange that may or may not have actual Gold and Silver backing it up. You want the real stuff.\n\nAnd because I love the free market and competition, I have two great companies to recommend to you. You can talk to both, see who you like better, and then take action!\n\nThe first is WLT Precious Metals ran by my friend Ira Bershatsky.\n\nI have personally sent family members to Ira for 5-figure purchases of Gold and Silver and he treated them like royalty. They were very pleased.\n\nThat's how much I trust Ira.\n\nI didn't tell him I was sending them over either (and these particular family members have a different last name) so I did it as a bit of a \"secret shopper\" test and Ira passed with flying colors.\n\nOf course I knew he would.\n\nThat's why I work with him and that's why I have confidence telling you about him.\n\nIra can handle bulk purchases of bullion, coins, whatever you want.\n\nAll custom ordered and shipped right to your door.\n\nA lot of people love Bullion because its the cheapest and most economical way to do it, to stretch your dollar into as much gold and silver as possible.\n\nThe website is called WLT Precious Metals and when you see my logo in the top left-hand corner, you'll know you're in the right place.\n\nYou'll get a personal phone call with Ira Bershatsky (or someone on his team) and they will work with you free of charge for as long as needed to answer any questions you have and get you taken care of.\n\nHow about that!\n\nYou don't see that much anymore, but Ira and his team pride themselves on good old-fashioned real customers service:\n\nHere's the only disclaimer I will give you: because they do pride themselves on dedicated service, it might take a few days before you get a phone call back. Just be patient.\n\nIra can also help you if you want to purchase Gold and Silver in your IRA.\n\nI mean, his name is Ira, after all, OF COURSE he can help you purchase in your IRA account.\n\nThe thing I love about purchasing in your IRA account is you can do it with no money out of pocket. You just take money already in the IRA account, perhaps in stocks or bonds or other investments, and you can shift it into Gold and Silver.\n\nAgain, I'm not your personalized financial advisor, I'm just explaining how it works.\n\nAnd it's REALLY cool.\n\nSo even if you're saying times are tough right now, I don't have a lot of spare money to shift into Gold and Silver, you might have a golden opportunity (pun intended!) already sitting there in an established retirement account.\n\nAn equally great company, I am so happy to be working with these guys.\n\nThis next company is called Genesis Gold and this is also for people who want to purchase real physical gold or silver in their IRAs (Investment Retirement Accounts).\n\nIn addition to \"no money out of pocket\", do you know what the beauty of that is?\n\nTAX FREE baby!\n\nI'm not a tax advisor, but that's a general oversimplification.\n\nNever pay more taxes than you are legally required to pay.\n\nAnd that's why I love getting gold and silver in my IRA (and why I hold a large chunk in an IRA myself!).\n\nThere's so much to love about Genesis Gold, starting with the fact they are proudly and un-ashamedly Christina!\n\nThey call it \"Faith-Driven Stewardship\" and they put it right on the homepage of their website along with a quote from Ezekiel:\n\nHere's more on why gold and silver in your IRA are so powerful:\n\nYou can contact Genesis Gold here.\n\nThey are also very backed up with record demand, so you may have to wait a bit, but someone WILL get in touch with you for personal customer service and assistance!\n\nTell 'em Noah sent ya!\n\nOh, and did you know Genesis is recommended by SUPERMAN himself?\n\nIt's true.\n\nSuperman himself, Clark Kent -- Dean Cain -- came on my show and we broke it all down:\n\nIn addition to bullion, coins or even Gold and Silver in your IRA, this has a very specific purpose and it might be worth having some on hand:\n\nA new physical precious metals product launched that immediately caused a stir in the gold and silver industry. \"Prepper Bar\" is a utility bar that is perforated to allow owners the ability to break off pieces ranging from 1.5 grams up to 7.7 grams.\n\nThey fit nicely in one's wallet so they can be carried around constantly.\n\n\"People have been asking me how we came up with the idea and I have to tell them that I can't take credit,\" said Jonathan Rose, CEO at Prepper Bar. \"Over the years, our customers have been asking for something tradeable, portable, and spendable so we made Prepper Bar as the perfect accommodation.\"\n\nThese 62 gram bars are flat and come in either silver or gold. The Silver Prepper Bar is available for immediate shipment while the Gold Prepper Bar will be available by the end of June.\n\nWe asked Rose what makes these bars so different from regular bars or coins.\n\n\"Gold and silver are great for holding wealth but you'd need a pretty sturdy hacksaw to shave off incremental chunks for sale or barter,\" he said. \"Prepper Bars are strong but they can be easily broken along the perforations so if we find ourselves in a pinch, we can break off the right amount, no problem.\"\n\n(Note: Thank you for supporting American businesses like the one presenting a sponsored message in this article and working with them through the links in this article which benefit WLTReport.

The Nikkei's 12.4% fall marked the worst day for the Japanese index since 1987's \"Black Monday\" -- the sudden and unexpected stock market crash that raised fears of a depression.\n\nMost major indices in Europe were most recently between 2% and 3% down, with the Stoxx Europe 600, Europe's benchmark stock index, falling 2.2%.\n\nAll of that follows on from brutal Friday trading, when a much weaker than expected U.S. jobs report made worse a market selloff that has been underway for some weeks now, although some indexes, such as the Nasdaq, are coming off recent record highs.\n\nIn recent weeks, rising concerns around a potential U.S. recession have spooked investors. Many in the market are now concerned that the Federal Reserve has been too cautious over cutting interest rates -- doing so makes money easier to borrow and move more freely -- and will now need to catch up with other global central banks, which have moved first.\n\nJapan's early-week selloff prompted Japan's finance minister Shunichi Suzuki to speak to the media, telling the press that he and his colleagues \"will continue to monitor domestic and international economic and financial market trends with a firm sense of urgency.\"\n\nSuzuki added that, despite Monday's selling, the Japanese economy is in relatively good health when compare with recent years.\n\n\"We have seen the highest wage increase in 33 years during this year's Spring Labor Negotiations, also capital investment has exceeded over 100 trillion yen, and the stock market has reached a historical high, all of which are positive developments,\" he said.\n\nA rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar -- making Japanese assets more expensive for holders of other currencies -- has also likely played a role in the selling.\n\nEven so, some investors put their money into U.S. Treasury bonds -- so-called 'haven' assets that act as stores of wealth in volatile moments.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's hard to tell what happens now", "body": "Australian stocks have closed down 3.7 per cent today, wiping more than $100 billion from the stockmarket.\n\nThat's the biggest fall since the pandemic lockdown era. Back then, financial markets panic spread like wildfire.\n\nNow, global financial markets are nervous, to say the least.\n\nIt was unclear, for days, if not weeks, how severely economies would be hit by locking everything down. That uncertainty was too much for financial markets to bear, and stock markets across the world, including in Australia, \"crashed\" - down 20 per cent or more.\n\nNow, investors are nervous about the health of the US economy following a couple of worse-than-expected economic releases, but there's something else here at play that could undo the global financial system. More on that later.\n\nFor now, what's the problem with the US economy?\n\nThis time last week investors were enjoying a record run in share prices.\n\nIndeed, the Australian and US stock markets were regularly setting fresh all-time highs.\n\nIt was what analysts call a \"Goldilocks scenario\".\n\nThat is, the US Federal Reserve -- Australia's equivalent of the Reserve Bank -- it was thought, had raised interest rates just enough to cool inflation while maintaining solid and sustainable economic growth.\n\nIt reached a point late last week that financial markets were convinced the US Fed -- as it's known -- would proceed with cutting interest rates.\n\nThis was seen as positive for shares, especially given renewed capacity big corporations would then have to borrow and invest or pay down debt.\n\nThen it all turned sour.\n\nTwo separate US labour market reports (Initial Jobless claims on Thursday and non-farm payroll data on Friday) confirmed many more Americans were out of work than previously thought.\n\nAdding to the economic pessimism, a separate report showed the US manufacturing sector was weak and contracting.\n\nThe \"Manufacturing PMI\" (July) came in at 46.8. The market was expecting 48.8.\n\nIt means the backbone of the US economy is contracting, and at an accelerating pace.\n\nUS stocks have fallen sharply in response, and Australian investors have taken their lead from that.\n\nThe selling pressure on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) today has been relentless.\n\n\"ASX 200 tumbling again with concerns now spreading to Asian markets,\" Marcus Today markets analyst Henry Jennings said.\n\nAnd that reference to Asian markets is critical, and the \"something else at play\" I mentioned above.\n\nJapan's benchmark stock index opened down 7 per cent. That's a share market dive in anybody's language.\n\nHere's the key problem in Japan: investors are being hit with what are known as \"margin calls\".\n\nJapan has been a super cheap place to borrow money - with interest rates at next to zero per cent.\n\nLast week the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rates to about 0.25 per cent.\n\nInvestors who have borrowed money to invest in shares that are now declining in value, are now being asked to stump up some cash, and in some cases they're selling shares in order to do that.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is a lot of margin calls, a lot of forced liquidations, there's a lot of leverage,\" Pepperstone's head of research Chris Weston told the ABC.\n\n\"A lot of retail investors in Japan have borrowed money - they've been incentivised to borrow money on leverage, and of course now that the market's in freefall, they're having to close those positions.\"\n\nThe carry trade is also unwinding. It involves global investors borrowing money from Japan (low interest rate environment) and investing it in the United States or Australia (relatively high interest rate environments).\n\nYou need to sell yen and buy dollars to do this (an American bank doesn't want Japanese yen).\n\nAs interest rates in Japan have moved higher, investors are selling out of their positions and that involves buying yen.\n\nThe higher yen is also causing Japanese stocks to plummet.\n\n\"The yen is strengthening significantly, it's been aggressive, it's been ferocious, and that's perpetuated into the Japanese stock market which is priced in yen,\" Mr Weston said.\n\n\"Everyone's getting out of carry trades at the moment.\"\n\nThe carry trade is also hurting US stocks.\n\n\"As the Japanese market has been hit very hard, US investors have lost money, but Japan is also one of the biggest equity markets in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"If there are concerns around the Japanese banking system then that will feed through into other global equity markets, including the US.\n\n\"Everyone's jumping out of high-growth tech, AI names, and they're going into Treasuries (bonds) and they're going into more defensive areas of the market.\"\n\nHenry Jennings agrees, and says that's affecting the ASX.\n\n\"The yen carry trade unwinding is the driving force of a lot of the Asian weakness. That is infecting our own market,\" he said.\n\n\"[Interest] rate sensitive stocks the biggest losers.\"\n\nAs for what tomorrow could have in store for Australian shares?\n\nWell, that depends, in part, on how Wall Street in the US trades tonight Australian time.\n\nHowever, as Henry Jennings puts it, markets are \"still very nervous\".\n\nThe Australian dollar has also come under pressure.\n\nIt's unclear at this stage when global financial markets will settle down.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"},

Equities dropped sharply, the dollar weakened, and bonds and the yen strengthened.\n\nGlobal financial markets are witnessing a wave of risk aversion, intensifying dynamics that had already begun to emerge late last week when disappointing US economic data sparked fears of a recession in the world's largest economy.\n\nAsian markets closed poorly, with Japan's Nikkei 225 Index down 12.4% to close at 31,458 points, the lowest level since December 2023.\n\nEuropean equity markets opened sharply lower on Monday. By 9:30 am Central European Time, the broader Euro STOXX 50 index was down 2.8%, reaching its lowest level since January and heading for its third consecutive day of losses.\n\nItaly's FTSE Mib was the primary laggard, tumbling 3.5%, on track for its worst single-day drop since March 2023. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Spain's Ibex 35 all fell 2.5%.\n\nBanking stocks were hit the hardest. ING Groep's shares tumbled 6.8%, followed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, which fell 5%, Deutsche Bank, down 4.4%, UniCredit, down 4%, Intesa Sanpaolo, down 3.9%, BNP Paribas, down 3.9%, and Banco Santander, down 3.5%.\n\nIn the bond market, yields declined along the German yield curve, with the 2-year yield down 6 basis points to 2.29%, its lowest since March 2023. The Bund yield fell 3 basis points to 2.14%, reflecting growing demand for safe-haven assets.\n\n\"Currently, the market sentiment indicates that weak data is no longer being interpreted as risk-positive due to weaker growth driving yields lower, rather than the disinflation story,\" wrote Mohamad Al-Saraf, FX and rates strategist at Danske Bank.\n\nThe euro rose against the dollar to 1.0950, reaching its highest level since March 2024, driven by the general weakness of the greenback. The Japanese yen saw five consecutive days of gains against the U.S. dollar, amid the unwinding of the \"carry trade\" that had pushed the yen to multi-decade lows in July. On Monday, the USD/JPY exchange rate tumbled over 2.4%, marking its worst session since late 2022.\n\nRecent US data revealed a worse-than-expected contraction in manufacturing activity last month, while the jobs report showed signs of worrisome cooling.\n\nThe US economy added only 114,000 new nonfarm payrolls in July, sharply down from the previous, downwardly revised figure of 179,000, and well below expectations of a 150,000 increase. Alarmingly, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose from 4.1% to 4.3%, reaching its highest since October 2021.\n\nQuarterly results from tech giants have been mixed, causing the S&P 500 index to close its third consecutive week in the red. Notably, Warren Buffett sold off almost half of his entire Apple stake, over $50bn (\u20ac46bn) worth of shares, bringing Berkshire's cash holdings to a record high of $277bn (\u20ac254bn).\n\nThe lower-than-expected economic data and the Wall Street pullback fuelled a rush to safe-haven assets, particularly US Treasury bonds, as investors increased their bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\nMarket-implied probabilities derived from interest rate futures saw a shakeup, with traders now almost fully pricing in a 50-basis-point cut in September, followed by another similar move in November, and a 25-basis-point reduction in December.\n\nLast week, the Federal Reserve hinted at a likely rate cut in September. However, Chairman Powell dismissed the idea of a 50-basis-point cut.\n\nAll eyes are on Monday's release of the ISM Services PMI for the United States to assess whether the contraction in manufacturing is spreading to the services sector, potentially signalling an ongoing recession. However, consensus among economists expects a rise in the overall index from 48.8 to 51.\n\nThe main winners in this phase of intensified global market selloff are bonds and the Japanese yen, reflecting significant movements in the interest rate market.\n\nChris Turner, ING's Global Head of Markets, wrote that lower US rates, more strategic Japanese FX intervention, and last week's hawkish hike from the Bank of Japan have all contributed to the woes in USD/JPY.\n\n\"We believe that this momentum of dollar weakness may continue in the short term, at least until the U.S. S&P PMI and ISM Index data for July expected today,\" wrote Luca Cigognini, market strategist at Intesa Sanpaolo.\n\nAccording to Cigognini, the yen remains strong in this environment, but the market could remain highly volatile. The same movement was seen in EUR/JPY, which, after closing Friday at around 160.00, started today at 155.80, making a reversal seem unlikely.\n\nGoldman Sachs increased their 12-month US recession odds by 10 percentage points to 25%. However, economist Jan Hatzius continues to see recession risk as limited, citing the overall soundness of the data and the absence of major financial imbalances. He also highlighted Chair Powell's emphasis on the Fed's ability to cut the funds rate by 525 basis points and quickly support the economy if necessary.\n\nDanske Bank expressed a bearish outlook on EUR/USD for the second half of the year, primarily due to the belief that too many Fed rate cuts have been priced in over the next 12 months.\n\nThey find the repricing of Fed cuts excessive, noting that, despite signs of weakening, the US economy is not on the brink of collapse. \"We expect EUR/USD to steadily decline towards 1.05/1.03 in the next 6 to 12 months,\" they wrote.", "source":

The U.S. market rout that started last week extended its spread to Asia, with equity markets starting the week with massive drops, some by as much as double-digits.\n\nBoth major Japanese equity indices, the Nikkei 225 and the broader Topix index, dropped by over 12%. The former index, which tracks 225 companies listed on the Japanese stock market, lost over 4,400 points, its biggest loss in point-terms.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 has now erased its gains to date, reversing a stock market rally that sent the Japanese index past a 34-year-old record earlier this year.\n\nAnalysts think the sell-off will continue. Investing in the Japanese market now is like \"catching a falling knife,\" Kelvin Tay, UBS's regional chief investment officer, told CNBC Asia.\n\nLast week, the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates for the second time this year. (Japan's central bank hiked rates for the first time in 17 years in March). That helped spark a rebound in the yen, which in recent months fell to record lows against the U.S. dollar.\n\nA stronger yen makes stocks more expensive for foreign investors, and potentially drags down earnings from major firms on the Tokyo stock exchange, as exports become more expensive and repatriated profits drop in value.\n\nFor instance, a weaker yen helped Toyota to record-high net profit for the quarter ending June, despite declining sales.\n\nShares in major Japanese companies plummeted Monday, tracking the markets. Toyota, Japan's most valuable company, saw its shares drop by 13.7%, wiping out 5.6 trillion yen ($39.3 billion) in value. Nintendo shares dropped 16.5%, following weak earnings from the video game company on Friday. Tokyo Electron, a major supplier of chipmaking tools, fell 18.5%. Softbank dropped 18.7%, marking the worst day for the tech giant since it went public in 1998.\n\nMarkets in South Korea and Taiwan dropped too, with tech stocks hit particularly hard.\n\nSouth Korea's benchmark KOSPI index closed down 8.8%, its largest drop since October 2008. The Taiex, Taiwan's benchmark index, dropped 8.4%, the worst sell-off since 1967.\n\nShares of Asian chipmaking companies associated with the AI boom dropped on Monday, following similar plunges from U.S. tech shares last week. Taiwan's TSMC and Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix, which all make semiconductors key to the AI boom, were down around 10% on Monday.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 10% from its record close on July 10.\n\nOther Asian markets dropped Monday, though to a lesser extent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.4%. India's NIFTY 50 is down around 2.7%.\n\nIn addition to Japan's moves on the yen, Asian investors may also be worried about weak economic data from the U.S. that could portend future recession. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that just 114,000 jobs were created in July, far below economist expectations. The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.3%.\n\nAnalysts expect the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Yet DBS chief economist Tamur Baig warned in a report that these expectations may not do much to buoy stocks, as those with substantial capital are \"trigger happy to sell at this juncture.\"\n\nTech stocks have also taken a beating in recent weeks. Political and regulatory uncertainty is hitting chipmaking shares, as the Biden administration reportedly considered new export controls on China, and as the Republican presidential candidate, former president Donald Trump, suggested that the island of Taiwan -- a key chipmaking hub -- should pay for its own defence.\n\nAI-related stocks have also declined as investors start to wonder when the benefits of the AI boom will materialize. Investors may also be profit-taking, noted Saxo's head of equity strategy Peter Garnry, on share surges from companies like Nvidia and Super Micro Computer.\n\n\"There's been a dramatic shift in market narrative from last week,\" Saxo global market strategist Charu Chanana told Reuters. \"U.S. economic data remains in the driving seat now, and the more the U.S. soft landing assumption gets questioned, the further pullback we can see.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lionel_lim@fortune.com", "name": "Lionel Lim", "type":

The selloff continued on emerging market bourses in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nTrading on Turkey's BIST-100 index was halted twice on Monday after heavy premarket losses. The index was last down 3.8% with an index of bank stocks slipping 4.2% as the lira dropped to record low against the dollar.\n\nMeanwhile, the yen leapt to a seven-month high against the dollar while crowded carry trades unwound, pressuring high-yielding emerging market currencies.\n\nA rebound in the yen, the most favored funding currency for carry trades, weighed on the U.S. dollar and lifted emerging market funding currencies like China's yuan.\n\n\"You had it really good while it lasted, but now we're getting clusters of risk-off unwinds in carry (trades), I see that to continue at least into Q4,\" Reid said.\n\nMalaysia's ringgit also continued its strong run, touching its highest to the dollar since April 2023.\n\nA 0.5% loss in the dollar helped lift MSCI's emerging market currency index 0.3%, with European emerging market currencies also regaining ground against the greenback.\n\nOn the other hand, high-yielding EM currencies lost ground, with the Indian rupee becoming the worst-performing Asian currency this year, while the Mexican peso touched its lowest since October 2022.\n\nOn the data front, Turkish annual inflation fell to 61.78% in July, just below expectations, while Czech retail sales rose 4.4%.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n** Purchasing Managers' Index data from a number of countries including Kenya, South Africa and Russia.\n\n** Bangladesh PM Hasina taken to 'safe

Experts believe that the move is expected to have an adverse impact on carry trade.\n\nJapanese stocks collapsed in their biggest single day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloff. The Nikkei share average shed 12.4% and yen rallied to 7-month highs versus the dollar. Japan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27% drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77. The index had wiped out 113 trillion yen ($792.32 billion) of that peak market value.\n\nCarry trade is a strategy that involves borrowing money in a currency which has a low-interest rate and investing it in asset classes that give a higher rate of return. The strategy is not only popular among forex traders but also used by fund managers who deal in equities and commodities.\n\nNo, it is primarily used with forex but carry trade is not limited to currencies only. Investors can employ carry trade by borrowing money in a currency with lower interest rates and deploying the capital in various asset classes.\n\nAs borrowing of the yen becomes more expensive due to higher interest rates, traders' profit margin will shrink.

Increased volatility resulted in traders being forced out of their positions. Despite a Bank of Japan rate hike and US employment data, these measures couldn't prevent the drastic market reaction.

However, over the past one month USDJPY is down 12.5 percent.\n\nAs the reverberations of a strengthening yen are being felt across global markets through unwinding of carry trades, analysts are drawing parallels with a similar situation during the global financial crisis of 2007-08.\n\nA carry trade is one in which money managers borrow in the currency with the lowest interest rates (yen, in this case), and deploy that money in other assets -- equities, bonds, commodities, currencies -- that offer a higher return. But when interest rates of the base currency start rising, the profit margins shrink, and the trades are liquidated.\n\nAlso Read | What is carry trade and how does Bank of Japan's rate hike affect it?\n\nThrowback to 2008\n\nJapan's roaring 80s lead to a huge bubble in the stock markets and real estate sector. As bubbles are prone to, this one also burst. In 1991, Japan was facing a major recession and the central bank decided to keep interest rates at lows, in an attempt to encourage consumption and borrowing.\n\nWhile the move was aimed as a shot in the arm of a weakening economy, cheap credit lured traders from around the world to Japanese shores. By 2007, the yen had weakened to 125 to the US dollar, and with the ultra low interest rates made it the most preferred currency for carry trades.\n\nThere is no data on how much money was tied up in Yen carry trades in the run to the 2008 global financial crisis, but some estimates put it in the region of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThe onset of the financial crisis led to a significant increase in risk aversion among investors. As uncertainty and volatility in financial markets surged, investors sought to reduce exposure to risky assets, including those financed through carry trades.\n\nThis triggered a chain reaction and eventually a vicious cycle. As global markets tumbled, investors fled risky assets and repatriated funds to safer currencies, including the yen. The result was that the yen appreciated significantly, hitting a high of 871.3 to the dollar by late December 2008.\n\nThis made many of the carry trades unprofitable, leading to more liquidation of such trades, roiling equity, bond and commodity markets across the globe.\n\nThe strong yen posed problems for Japan as well. The economy was extremely reliant on exports, but Japanese products were now pricier compared to competitors. Also, as a result of the global recession, consumption had sunk. During the crisis, Japan saw the worst economic performance in the G7.\n\n2007 versus 2024\n\nWhile both periods are marked by sharp global risk aversion, leading to a flight to safety, there are some key differences. Currently, risks are compelling investors to unwind their carry transactions, selling higher yielding currencies while simultaneously buying back Japanese Yen. This has resulted in a quick rise in the Yen in both periods.\n\nHowever, the unwinding in 2007-08 was more dramatic and anticipated, substantially adding to the global financial crisis. \"While the 2007-08 crisis was caused by the systematic collapse of the financial system, the current situation, marked by uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, does not appear to be as dire,\" said Aamir Makda, Commodity & Currency Analyst, Choice Broking.\n\nHe added that since then, central banks have become more engaged in intervening in currency markets in recent years, which could mitigate the impact of carry trade unwinding.\n\nIn 2008, the USDJPY had dropped from 125 to 87, nearly 30 percent. However, over the past one month USDJPY is down 12.5 percent.\n\n\"This time, carry trades are notably elevated, as Japan's prolonged ultra-dovish stance has created a stark divergence in monetary policy. However, this doesn't necessarily mean we'll see a comparable appreciation in the JPY. In 2007/08, the price movement was significant due to the Global Financial Crisis,\" said Anindya Banerjee, SVP: Head of Research, Kotak Securities.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk aversion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/01/dollar-yen.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790421", "eventUri": "eng-9790421", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-12-", "textStart": 2116, "textEnd": 2129}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

The Nikkei's 12.4% fall marked the worst day for the Japanese index since 1987's \"Black Monday\" -- the sudden and unexpected stock market crash that raised fears of a depression.\n\nMost major indices in Europe were most recently between 2% and 3% down, with the Stoxx Europe 600, Europe's benchmark stock index, falling 2.2%.\n\nAll of that follows on from brutal Friday trading, when a much weaker than expected U.S. jobs report made worse a market selloff that has been underway for some weeks now, although some indexes, such as the Nasdaq, are coming off recent record highs.\n\nIn recent weeks, rising concerns around a potential U.S. recession have spooked investors. Many in the market are now concerned that the Federal Reserve has been too cautious over cutting interest rates -- doing so makes money easier to borrow and move more freely -- and will now need to catch up with other global central banks, which have moved first.\n\nJapan's early-week selloff prompted Japan's finance minister Shunichi Suzuki to speak to the media, telling the press that he and his colleagues \"will continue to monitor domestic and international economic and financial market trends with a firm sense of urgency.\"\n\nSuzuki added that, despite Monday's selling, the Japanese economy is in relatively good health when compare with recent years.\n\n\"We have seen the highest wage increase in 33 years during this year's Spring Labor Negotiations, also capital investment has exceeded over 100 trillion yen, and the stock market has reached a historical high, all of which are positive developments,\" he said.\n\nA rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar -- making Japanese assets more expensive for holders of other currencies -- has also likely played a role in the selling.\n\nEven so, some investors put their money into U.S. Treasury bonds -- so-called 'haven' assets that act as stores of wealth in volatile moments.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Though the international markets saw one of their biggest falls, the Japanese markets tumbled as much as 12 per cent, its biggest fall since 1987, caused by the fear of an end of carry trade.\n\nWhat Is A Carry Trade?\n\n\"Japanese markets fear that there can be an end of the carry trade,\" Sharad Chandra Shukla, director at Mehta Equities, said.\n\nCarry Trade is when an investor borrows in a currency with low interest rates, such as the yen, and reinvests in a currency with a higher rate of return like the dollar.\n\nFor 30 years, the Bank of Japan kept an interest rate near zero, which made investors borrow and invest in T-bills and equities across the globe. If interest rates go up in Japan, this trade will unwind, Shukla said.\n\nApart from the carry trade, US economic data and geopolitical tensions are the other reasons for the markets to correct, he added.\n\nThe Nikkei Stock Average, which is Japan's benchmark index, on Monday saw its worst-ever daily sell-off, losing 4,451.28 points from the previous day's closing, according to Nikkei Asia. The average closed down 12.4 per cent to 31,458.42.

Factors like disappointing US jobs data and recession worries added to the gloom. Analysts likened this event to panic-driven market drops after major crises, recalling sentiments from the Lehman Brothers collapse and Japan's post-3/11 earthquake shock. The chaos was further fueled by the Bank of Japan's rate hike and quantitative tightening, creating a bleak landscape for stocks, particularly in automotive and technology sectors.\n\nThe massive yen appreciation and global market meltdown have led to a cascade of unwinding carry trades, deepening market declines. The Bank of Japan's recent policies and weak stances from the US Federal Reserve added fuel to the fire, causing a ripple effect across sectors from autos to technology. Investors should prepare for potential further declines and a volatile market climate in the near term.\n\nThe bigger picture: Recession fears and policy impacts.\n\nThe dramatic drop in Japanese stocks serves as a stark reminder of how interconnected global markets are. With recession fears looming and crucial policy shifts from major central banks, this event could impact not just Japanese markets but the global economic landscape.

A stronger yen typically puts pressure on Japan's stock markets.\n\nThe intervention was followed by the Bank of Japan last week raising the benchmark interest rate to its highest level since 2008 and saying it would trim its purchase of Japanese government bonds.\n\nBut Monex Group's Koll said he was \"not at all\" concerned about financial stability in the country. Japan's banking system is well capitalized, and the exposure to global market gyrations is limited, he said.\n\n\"The exciting thing is that domestic business investment expenditure continues to grow, the unemployment rate in Japan will continue to fall unlike in the United States. ...

Taiwan and South Korean equities were tagged for more than 8% in a sea of red that spared no one.\n\nThe severity of today's sell-off has caught many by surprise, and the broader impact on global financial markets is yet to be fully realized.\n\nEurope's Stoxx 600 is off 2.4%, nearly matching its pre-weekend loss. It is back at levels last seen in February.\n\nThe S&P 500 Futures are off almost 3% and the Nasdaq futures are down about 4.5%. Haven flows into fixed income saw the 10-year JGB yield tumbled nearly 16 bp to 0.77%.\n\nEuropean benchmark 10-year yields are down mostly 2-4 bp, with the 10-year German Bund yield off more than five basis points. The 10-year US Treasury yield is off 5 bp near 3.74% and the two-year yield is down 11 bp to almost 3.76%.\n\nMarket talk is of an emergency cut by the Federal Reserve. Ahead of the weekend, there was heightened speculation of a 50 bp cut in September.\n\nThe yen's surge is the main feature of the foreign exchange market. It is up about 3.25% on the day with the dollar slightly above JPY142.\n\nThe unwinding of carry trades has also underpinned the Swiss franc, which is more than 1% stronger today. The other side of the carry trade, such as the Australian dollar, has been hit.\n\nThe Aussie is off nearly 1%. The euro rose to $1.0975, a little shy of the year's high, and is hovering above $1.0950. Sterling is chopping between roughly $1.2710 and $1.2815.\n\nThe Canadian dollar is flattish. Among emerging market currencies, the Mexican peso, a favorite of carry-trade strategies is off nearly 3% followed by the South African range's 1.65% loss.\n\nMost emerging market currencies, including the Chinese yuan are firmer. Gold is trading heavier inside the pre-weekend range.\n\nSeptember WTI extended its pre-weekend losses and is trading below $72 for the first time since February.\n\nWith today's losses, the dollar has fallen by about 12.5% against the yen since the July 10 high (a day before the US June CPI).\n\nThe greenback punched through the (61.8%) retracement of this year's rally (~JPY148.50) and through the trendline drawn off the 2023 lows (~JPY148) before the weekend. It has fallen to JPY141.70 today. While near JPY140.75, the dollar is about three standard deviations from the 20-day moving average, the next important chart area is JPY140.\n\nThe speculative positioning in the futures market through July 30 showed it was overwhelmingly short covering of the yen as opposed to new longs. Specifically, the 33k short yen contracts were covered while the bull added only about 625 contracts (the notional value is about $83k per contract).\n\nSpeculators have a gross short yen position of about 138.5k contracts, back to February levels. At the end of last year, the gross short yen position was slightly less than 100k contracts.\n\nIn the week ending July 26, foreign investors sold JPY1.56 trillion (~$10.7 bln) of Japanese cash equities and futures, according to Japan Exchange Group.\n\nJapan itself is the world's largest net creditor, with around $4.4 trillion in foreign portfolio investments. The key issue is whether some of this is begin repatriated, not just speculative positioning.\n\nThe unwinding of carry trades took the Australian dollar to $0.6350 (Friday's settlement was about $0.6510), a new low for the year, before snapping back to around $0.6450-60. The $0.6480-$0.6500 area offers nearby resistance. The low set in Q4 23 was near $0.6270.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia meets the first thing tomorrow. The market switched last week away from a tightening bias and has nearly a 50% chance of a rate cut next month and it is fully discounted in November.\n\nThe offshore yuan soared by 1.2% ahead of the weekend, which is a particularly large move for the yuan, and easily the largest of the year. It is up another 0.50% today.\n\nIt was not a change in China's policies that is driving the yuan, but the recovery of the yen, broad setback of the US dollar, and the sharp fall in US rates. The dollar fell to CNH7.1110 today before stabilizing.\n\nThe dollar reached CNY7.1250. It had settled last week near CNY7.1720. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1345 (CNY71323 Friday).\n\nThe euro gain about 1.1% before the weekend, the largest single-day advance since last November. To us, it is instructive that it took place not because of good news from Europe but poor news from the US. The week's gain was modest around 0.55%, but it offset the previous two weeks of losses in full.\n\nToday's gains carried the euro to $1.0975, slightly shy of the year's high set in March near $1.0980. The upper Bollinger Band is about $1.0955. The $1.10 area may pose more formidable psychological resistance. Initial support may be around $1.0925.\n\nAhead of the weekend, sterling had fallen to almost $1.27, its lowest level in a month before recovering smartly on the back of the dollar's slump. It settled above $1.28 last week. It approached $1.27 today and again recovered through $1.28 where sellers capped in front of $1.2820.\n\nThe $1.2875 area, which houses the (50%) of the decline since July 17 high for the year (~$1.3045) to the pre-weekend low, the 20-day moving average (~$1.2885), and recent price congestion is an important near-term hurdle. Still, it may take a move above the $1.2900-15 area to signal another run that the highs.\n\nThe US data in the coming days simply does not have the heft to impact sentiment much. After a series of poor data from the labor market, including rising jobless claims, falling hiring, and quit rates, weak ISM survey results, cooling unit labor costs and Employment Cost Index, the US reported 114k rise in nonfarm payrolls, well below expectations and the fourth consecutive monthly rise in the unemployment rate.\n\nThe destabilized capital markets have spurred speculation of an emergency Fed cut within a week. After nearing buy holdings below CAD1.39 in the last two sessions, the US dollar jumped to almost CAD1.3950 today before pulling back to almost CAD1.3860. It takes a move back below CAD1.38 to suggest a top is being formed, and our bias is to look for a topping formation.\n\nThe Mexican peso has borne the brunt of the unwinding carry-trade strategies. The US dollar extended its gains since the middle of July against the Mexican peso. It soared to MXN21.2180 today, the highest in nearly two year.\n\nIt traded beyond three standard deviations from the 20-day moving average (~MXN19.9350). It has steadied somewhat, but near midday in Europe, the greenback is still about 3% higher on the day.\n\nIt had gained nearly 3% in the past two sessions combined. At today's peak, the dollar had risen by a little more than 15% from the mid-July low.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Khoon Goh answers", "body": "There are a lot of people putting a focus on the Sahm rule that has been triggered, but this is the first time we will see whether or not it really does lead to a recession as what the historical backtesting suggests.\"I think the further unwinding of the yen carry trade has triggered potentially further stop losses and perhaps even margin calls which then see further losses and slippage in the pricing,\" says Khoon Goh, Head-Asia Research, ANZ.\n\nNow, it appears that a variety of factors are coming together. First, the weak macro data coming out of US which actually triggered that it is a growth concern, not necessarily an issue of inflation getting under check. At the same time, what is happening in the Middle East and then, of course, how can we miss out Japan? How do you see all these factors play out in terms of fund flows purely for emerging markets like India?\n\nKhoon Goh: I think the initial trigger for this massive sell-off is the unwinding of the yen carry trade. Now, this really started a couple of weeks ago and started to gain momentum and then, when you overlay on top of that the recession concerns following the weak US data and, of course, the fear around impending attack by Iran over the weekend, I think all that just caused further paring back of risk by investors.\n\nAnd just to complicate factors, we are also in a period where liquidity is quite low because historically the month of August tends to be a period with the Northern Hemisphere summer where a lot of people are away on holiday. So, therefore, liquidity tends to be lower than normal and then you have huge event risk like what we are seeing now that just causes huge gaps and moves within markets.\n\nAnd I think today the further unwinding of the yen carry trade has triggered potentially further stop losses and perhaps even margin calls which then see further losses and slippage in the pricing.\n\nThat explains the backdrop as to what is happening and why is it happening. The question is, what next now? There is a lot of this increased chatter and clamour around rate cuts coming in from the US and a lot of chatter around an emergency meeting coming in. Of course, it is not confirmed nor that it is coming in from official channels, but what do you see the probability of that if at all and is September pretty much priced in then?\n\nKhoon Goh: Look, the markets are already pricing in a high chance of a 50 basis point rate cut for September and almost five full 25 basis point rate cuts by the end of the year. So, market has swung quite aggressively towards expecting the Fed to slash rates very aggressively.\n\nNow, I think to me, this seems to be an overreaction because if you look at the real economy in the US, it does not feel like it is teetering into recession. Yes, we had weaker than expected non-farm payrolls number. The unemployment rate did take up to 4.3%, but 4.3% is still historically very low.\n\nThere are a lot of people putting a focus on the Sahm rule that has been triggered, but this is the first time we will see whether or not it really does lead to a recession as what the historical backtesting suggests. So, it is not entirely clear that the US economy is slipping into a downturn which warrants aggressive easing from the Fed. Now, market reaction has been severe, but again, I pin that down to an unwinding of the yen carry trade rather than the recession fears necessarily.\n\nAnd if it is purely unwinding of the yen carry trade, at some stage once the liquidation is done, you will see markets calm down and we will see probably a rebound and that would not require the Fed or any other central bank to come in and rescue the markets. I think we just have to let markets play things out. And as long as there is not any contagion or spillover effects into the real economy, I think that is where central banks will be most focused on.\n\nI want to understand how legitimate is the fear of US slowdown actually having an impact of overall growth slowdown in the rest of the world?\n\nKhoon Goh: Now, if you look at the rest of the world, particularly in Asia, the growth has actually been holding up very well. We have seen huge, strong pickup in exports right across the board, driven by the tech sector.\n\nWe have seen GDP growth in this region coming in quite strong. PMIs generally are still riding above 50, which indicates an expansion territory. And the biggest growth concern has been previously around China, but even then we started to see policymakers coming out and competing towards providing more support to boost household consumption.\n\nSo, in terms of the real economy and how the global economy is tracking, it is actually performing reasonably well. And the recent jitters around the US, just because we had a slight pickup in the unemployment rate, again to me feels like a bit of an overreaction in the near term.\n\nWhere do you see a bit of a stabilisation happening for yen, at least at the moment, and do you expect any policy action or any intervention from the Bank of Japan or even in Korea and other places?\n\nKhoon Goh: Well, we have not heard or seen any official comments from either the Ministry of Finance or the Bank of Japan officials around the sharp rally we have seen in the yen.\n\nI think we are probably looking at potentially the next key level in dollar-yen at 140. We might see the market start to stabilise around there, but a lot of it depends on whether there is further to go in terms of this unwinding of the yen carry trade.\n\nI think markets have really put on this trade over a long period of time, trying to take advantage of cheap yen funding, and that worked out well for the first half of this year. We are starting to see that trade unravel very quickly.

He added that fundamentals in the country are \"actually much, much more solid\".\n\n\"I'm actually prepared to dip my toe into the water and start buying Japan,\" said Koll, who is head of Japan at Monex Group.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 fell 12.4% on Monday, its biggest daily drop since 1987's so-called \"Black Monday,\" as global markets pulled back. The move lower has deterred some investors, with Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management telling CNBC earlier on Monday that going into the Japanese market right now would be like catching \"a falling knife.\"\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government was cooperating with the central bank and closely watching financial market moves with \"grave concern,\" Reuters reported. Suzuki added that foreign exchange levels were being watched by authorities.\n\nAuthorities last month intervened to shore up the yen, data from the country's Ministry of Finance showed, after the yen hit a 38-year low against the U.S. dollar in July. A stronger yen typically puts pressure on Japan's stock markets.\n\nThe intervention was followed by the Bank of Japan last week raising the benchmark interest rate to its highest level since 2008 and saying it would trim its purchase of Japanese government bonds.\n\nBut Monex Group's Koll said he was \"not at all\" concerned about financial stability in the country. Japan's banking system is well capitalized, and the exposure to global market gyrations is limited, he said.\n\n\"The exciting thing is that domestic business investment expenditure continues to grow, the unemployment rate in Japan will continue to fall unlike in the United States. ...

Weaker-than-expected US jobs data and disappointing tech earnings sparked a global sell-off in stocks, oil, and high-yielding currencies. The Bank of Japan's recent 15-basis-point rate hike to 0.25% added more fuel to the yen's ascent, as did the broader weakening of the dollar, which hit a near five-month low against an index of major currencies. Traditional safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc saw increased demand, with the franc rising about 1% to a seven-month high against the dollar. The unwinding of carry trades -- borrowing in low-interest-rate currencies to invest in higher-yielding assets -- further impacted the forex market.\n\nThe global sell-off has led to declines in stock indexes, a tumble in high-yielding currencies like the Indian rupee and Mexican peso, and a sharp fall in US Treasury yields, heightening expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Japanese stocks faced their biggest single-day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloffs, illustrating the widespread ripple effect of these currency movements.\n\nThe bigger picture: Safe havens in the storm.\n\nThe shifting landscape underscores the continued importance of safe-haven currencies amid global economic turbulence. As geopolitical concerns and economic uncertainties weigh on investor sentiment, currencies like the yen and Swiss franc are likely to remain attractive. The European Central Bank's rate cut expectations have also risen, with the euro gaining 0.3% due to the dollar's weakness.

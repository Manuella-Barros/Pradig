Julen Lopetegui's intent on bolstering the team with young talent for the upcoming season. Guilherme may become a key player in West Ham's future plans, despite uncertainty about his role.\n\nWest Ham United should eventually seal a day for Brazilian winger Luis Guilhereme in the coming days, according to GMS sources, with him set to undergo a medical on Wednesday so that a deal can be signed and sealed ahead of the club's pre-season campaign getting underway.\n\nJulen Lopetegui is looking to have a positive summer transfer window after being appointed as David Moyes' successor in May 2024. With the future of the talismanic Jarrod Bowen up in the air, signing a new right-winger, one that can develop in east London, is being eyed.\n\nRelated West Ham Have Already Identified Four Signings for Lopetegui as \u00a3100m Update Emerges West Ham could spend big this summer and have already identified the positions they want to strengthen\n\nShould the Englishman up and leave in the coming months, Guilherme could well be his long-term replacement on the right-hand side of the West Ham attack. After setting the Brazil Serie A alight, the versatile forward - who is able to play anywhere across the front line - is looking to seal a career-defining move away.\n\nWest Ham Should 'Seal a Deal' for Guilherme Soon Deal could cost as high as \u00a325 million\n\nBarring any more hiccups, the Hammers are set to complete their first transfer deal of the summer by signing the 18-year-old. After making his professional Palmeiras debut as a fresh-faced 17-year-old last year, West Ham have been among his potential suitors.\n\nShould all go to plan, it has been revealed by GMS sources that a deal for the youngster, who is tipped to become the 'next Ronaldinho', could be rubber-stamped between Palmeiras and West Ham by Thursday, allowing him to get a full summer of pre-season work in with his potential new employers.\n\nGMS sources described the talks as a 'rollercoaster' and hence why it's difficult to say that a deal is done and dusted. However, they did reveal that Guilherme, 18, is now in England and there have been little to no problems thus far.\n\nIn terms of how much Guilherme's signature is set to cost Lopetegui and Co, GMS sources have confirmed that a fee of \u00a325 million, including clauses, is believed to be enough for the Premier League outfit to get a deal across the line.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: At just 18 years of age, Guilherme has played 45 games in all competitions, notching one and goal assist apiece.\n\nHow Guilherme Will Fit In is 'Unclear' Brazil is 'a place of major interest' for West Ham\n\nAs alluded to, the fact that Guilherme is already in England in order to undergo his West Ham medical. Should he find no struggles when completing all of his pre-signing tasks, the Hammers are hoping to have their move green-lit on Wednesday.\n\nWhat, however, is relatively unclear is how he will fit into senior proceedings at the London Stadium.

According to the BBC, the 18-year-old talent was set to have his medical at the London club this week, ahead of a \u00a325.5 million (\u20ac30.2m) transfer. Guilherme will make the move to West Ham as the club's ninth most expensive signing ever, narrowly coming in above Nikola Vla\u0161i\u0107's move from CSKA Moskow in 2021.\n\nHowever, unlike West Ham's typical policy of signing ready-made Premier League stars or prospects from Europe's top leagues, Guilherme will most likely make the move to London as a relatively unknown quantity. And for the aforementioned sizable sum of money the club are spending on him, West Ham fans would be forgiven for wanting to know all they can about their new star midfielder ahead of next season. So let's take a look at what Guilherme has done in Brazil and what West Ham fans can expect.\n\nSince he made his debut for the club in March of last year, Guilherme has established himself as a handy squad player, capable of playing a number of positions. Over the course of the last two seasons, Guilherme has played on the left wing, right wing, through the middle and even at times as a striker. But, despite being capable of playing a number of roles, there may be a position that suits him best at West Ham next season. \"He plays mainly as a right-sided midfielder or a right winger,but has the ability to play in the left and has been even better as a central attacking midfielder,\" noted Marcos Watts, Transfermarkt Area Manager for Brazil. \"I see him as a proper no.10 in the future.\" This will clearly be music to the ears of West Ham fans, who will rightfully be concerned that they may start next season without their star No.10, Lucas Paquet\u00e1, who was recently charged on four accounts of potential betting breaches, by the English FA. Should Paquet\u00e1 face a lengthy ban, Guilherme may be just the man to step in for West Ham next season.\n\nDue to the player's remarkably young age, it's difficult to get a clear idea of how good Guilherme actually is. In 45 appearances for Palmeiras across all competitions, the midfielder has managed just one goal and one assist. While his nine appearances for the Brazilian national team's youth sides have offered up just two goals. But, according to Watts, such figures shouldn't put West Ham fans off a player with immense potential. \"He is a very good player, with potential to be great,\" noted the Brazilian football expert. \"He might be one of the best players in this new generation of Brazilian wonderkids. He might not have reached the same level of development as his fellow teammates Endrick or Est\u00eav\u00e3o, but that's the life of a midfielder/winger sometimes. A move to England - especially to a club outside of the big six - might just set him up in the best environment and give him the perfect amount of time and pressure he needs, all while playing in the best league in the world.\"\n\nWith a new head coach appointed in the form of Julen Lopetegui and clear hopes to break into the top four in the future, Guilherme may find that his new club are just as ambitious as he is in their bid to make a name for themselves in the Premier League next season. Whether the young Brazilian talent will be able to hit the ground running in the English top-flight remains to be seen, but there's no doubt that West Ham fans have plenty to be excited about next season.", "source": {"uri": "transfermarkt.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "transfermarkt.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Vla\u0161i\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Vla\u0161i\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFC_CSKA_Moscow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PFC CSKA Moscow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_Palmeiras", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Paquet\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Paquet\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Brazil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in Brazil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://tmssl.akamaized.net/images/foto/big/guilherme-spotlight-1718187487-139281.png?lm=1718187499", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648406", "eventUri": "eng-9648406", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

English clubs are likely to face competition from several sides in Europe for Miranda's signature - GMS sources can reveal Porto and AC Milan are also interested in the promising defender.\n\nMiranda, who joined Betis in 2021, saw his contract expire this summer. West Ham look the most likely destination if he chooses England as his next career stop. Under new manager Julen Lopetegui, the Hammers are keen to bring in a new left-back this summer with Emerson's backup, Aaron Cresswell, turning 35 in December.\n\nAfter parting ways with David Moyes, the Irons are targeting multiple signings this summer, including Palmeiras starlet Luis Guilherme.\n\nWest Ham in Race for Miranda Multiple clubs are interested\n\nThe highly sought-after Miranda was close to joining Milan in January and now the Rossoneri seem to have reignited their interest in him. The Spaniard could be tempted by the opportunity to play Champions League football next season, but he would have to compete with Theo Hernandez for a place in the starting eleven.\n\nWest Ham could tempt Miranda by offering more playing time for the 24-year-old, who is a product of Barcelona's La Masia academy. Before signing a permanent deal with Betis in 2021, Miranda made his Barcelona debut in 2018 and even faced off against Tottenham in the Champions League the same season.\n\nAccording to previous reports, the left-back has been on West Ham's radar since last January as the Hammers sent scouts to watch him in action in Spain.\n\nJuan Miranda Stats (2023-24)\n\nCompetition\n\nGames\n\nGoals\n\nAssists\n\nLa Liga\n\n25\n\n1\n\n1\n\nEuropa League\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\nConference League\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\nCopa del Rey\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\nRelated West Ham Deal For 'Messiah' is Now 'Very Close' Liverpool and Brentford have also showed interest in the 18-year-old starlet.

The Hammers are looking to sign two defenders, a central midfielder and a striker to revamp the squad that had just finished ninth in the Premier League.\n\nAccording to Jones, West Ham could invest as much as \u00a3100m in new players this summer as they target the likes of Youssef En-Nesyri and Serhou Guirassy to bolster their attack.\n\nThe East London outfit were close to completing a deal for Brazilian centre-back Fabricio Bruno, but the transfer of the 28-year-old collapsed over wage concerns.\n\nJones suggested West Ham are planning to act early in the transfer market this summer with new signings are expected imminently.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

Failed attempts to sign Fabricio Bruno means a centre-back is being lined up; club are reportedly eyeing Nehuen Perez but a deal is not close yet. Improving defence is critical after poor defensive performance last season. There is the potential for European qualification if key positions are filled.\n\nWest Ham United are set for a huge summer under Julen Lopetegui as they aim to find their way back into European football following this season's failure to qualify for a continental tournament - and that could be without Nayef Aguerd, with Dharmesh Sheth claiming that the defender's exit is \"one to keep an eye on\".\n\nAguerd, described as 'exceptional' by Gary Lineker, joined West Ham in June 2022, winning the Europa Conference League trophy in his first season at the club and putting in some strong performances in the second half of the Premier League season after recovering from an ankle injury. But his second campaign in London didn't quite go to plan, falling in and out of the side before being completely dropped for seven of the last nine games. And that could see him leave, Sheth states - with other centre-backs set to come into the club.\n\nWest Ham: Centre-Back Transfer Latest The Irons are in need of other recruits\n\nWest Ham went in for Fabricio Bruno in May, but a move broke down with the defender reportedly getting cold feet over the terms offered to him by Hammers chiefs and so far, he remains at Flamengo in Brazli.\n\nThe Hammers are reportedly close to signing Luis Guilherme, but that doesn't cover their centre-back problems and others will likely be targeted with the club missing out on Bruno.\n\nNayef Aguerd's Premier League statistics - West Ham squad ranking\n\nStats\n\nOutput\n\nSquad rank\n\nAppearances\n\n21\n\n12th\n\nClearances Per Game\n\n3.8\n\n3rd\n\nLong Passes Per Game\n\n5\n\n3rd\n\nTackles Per Game\n\n1.2\n\n=9th\n\nInterceptions Per Game\n\n0.8\n\n8th\n\nNehuen Perez has been linked with a move from Udinese, but any deal taking him to east London is still a long way from completion - but if he does make the switch, it could force Aguerd out of the door given that he would be behind Kurt Zouma, Perez and Konstantinos Mavropanos in the pecking order.\n\nSheth: Aguerd Exit \"One to Keep an Eye on\" The defender could part after a two-year spell\n\nSpeaking exclusively to GIVEMESPORT, Sheth stated that Aguerd's exit would be one to keep an eye on in the summer transfer window given that it is clear the Irons have been targeting other players in his position in their bid to enhance the small playing squad. He said:\n\n\"I think it is clear that that's an area they do want to strengthen, that there's lots of talk about Nayef Aguerd potentially leaving West Ham United - that's definitely one to keep an eye on.\n\n\"But the fact that they are going in for a centre-back in Fabricio Bruno would suggest that that is definitely an area they are prioritising during this summer's transfer window.\"\n\nWest Ham Need Defensive Reinforcements The Hammers leaked goals throughout the season under David Moyes\n\nWest Ham's defence was one of the worst in the Premier League last season and under David Moyes, who is a typically defensively astute manager, warning bells have been ringing.\n\nOnly the three relegated sides in Luton Town, Burnley and Sheffield United conceded more than a side who are used to qualifying for European football and with that in mind, reinforcements would enhance their team.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: West Ham conceded 74 goals in the league last season - their most since 1967.\n\nAn attacking trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohammed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta is one of the best in the league when they get going and if the Hammers can sign a striker, a centre-back and a right-back to offset the potential departure of Ben Johnson, the Hammers could have a real go at breaking into the mould next season if they can keep their players fit.\n\nRelated West Ham Likely Destination if 24 y/o Wants Premier League The Hammers face competition for the highly sought-after Spaniard this summer.\n\nStatistics courtesy of WhoScored.

The initial fee paid will be \u20ac23m, plus \u20ac7m in add-ons and a 20 per cent sell-on clause to Palmeiras.\n\nGuilherme, 18, has signed a five-year deal, with the option of a further year. He is the first signing for Julen Lopetegui, who replaced David Moyes as head coach at the end of the season. Those close to Guilherme were always confident he would join West Ham despite late interest from an unnamed club in the Saudi Pro League.\n\nHe did not get the opportunity to say bye to his team-mates or staff behind the scenes and travelled to London on Monday with his representatives, completing his medical the following day. Guilherme does not speak English, but West Ham will provide him with English classes.\n\nGuilherme scored one goal and registered one assist in 45 appearances for Palmeiras. He was the fourth youngest player to feature in the Campeonato Brasileiro in 2023 (at 17 years, two months and six days), behind Rayan (Vasco da Gama) and team-mates Endrick and Estevao Willian.\n\nHe arrived at Palmeiras in 2017 after impressing at football schools in Aracaju, his hometown. His time at Verdao was successful with the under-11s, winning the Campeonato Paulista and the under-13 and under-15 State Championships. Guilherme was part of the Brazil under-17 side that won the Montaigu Tournament in 2022, the competition contested by under-16 national teams and clubs.\n\nGuilherme is the latest talent from Palmeiras to have caught the radar of a Premier League side. Chelsea are set to complete the signing of midfielder Estavao Willian for a fee in the region of \u20ac60m. In August 2016, Gabriel Jesus, now of Arsenal, joined Manchester City for \u20ac32m and Danilo joined Nottingham Forest for \u20ac20m from the Brazilian side in January 2023.\n\n\"I'm not surprised Guilherme has joined a Premier League club,\" says Thiago Ferri, a journalist who covers Palmeiras for Brazilian media outlet Ge. \"There was always the expectation that he would go to Europe, just like Endrick (who is moving to Real Madrid this summer) and Estevao. Although he wasn't a key player in Abel Ferreira's (the manager) squad, his talent makes everyone believe he will keep evolving and progress well in the Premier League. He is a player that is still improving physically. He is fast and great in one-on-one situations. He is a player with a high ceiling.\n\n\"But it hasn't been an easy journey for Luis and his family. His mom, Ana Maria, quit her job in Aracaju to move with him to Sao Paulo when he was 11. She's played a big role in his career. His father, Gladson, still lives in Sergipe but is close to him, too.\"\n\nGuilherme, who idolises Lionel Messi, initially started his career as a midfielder before transitioning into a forward. He signed his first professional contract in June 2022. In April, the youngster scored his first professional goal in the 3-2 victory over Independiente del Valle and publicly thanked Ferreira for having faith in him.\n\nPalmeiras' youth director, Joao Paulo Sampaio, has played an important role in Guilherme's development and has tipped him for the top of the game.\n\n\"I can say that I can have a future FIFA Ballon d'Or winner here,\" Sampaio told Ge. \"Endrick and Luis will be top level in the world. Luis is a technically different guy; physically he and Endrick are two phenomena because they are above average and have the mentality of wanting to be bigger. I brought them both at 14 years old to play for the under-17s and they were both training better than the 17-year-old boys at home.\n\n\"We played in a tournament in Japan and Luis scored over 40 goals. The Japanese players were scared of him. But Luis doesn't get carried away. He knows the potential he has. He's a special player.\"\n\nDespite Guilherme being highly rated, there is risk in signing an unproven prospect from the Brazilian league. A case in point is West Ham breaking their transfer record to sign Savio Nsereko from Italian side Brescia for \u00a39million in January 2009. The then 19-year-old failed to score in his 10 appearances and his career nose-dived thereafter. For context, the \u00a39m fee was greater than the club's previous biggest outlay, the \u00a37.5million spent on signing Craig Bellamy from Liverpool in 2007. Fifteen years on and there is more due diligence from West Ham's recruitment team with new signings, but Guilherme's paltry return of goals and assists for Palmeiras hardly stands out.\n\nWest Ham are not signing Guilherme to develop with the under-21s. He has been signed to challenge Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Paqueta and Jarrod Bowen for a starting berth.\n\n\"Luis was always considered really talented and one of the biggest names in the Palmeiras youth academy, with Endrick and Estevao,\" says Ferri. \"But in the professional team, he did not have the impact that was expected. Abel Ferreira used him sometimes as a left-winger, although he used to play as a No 10 in the under-20s and under-17s.\"\n\nWest Ham hope to make six signings this summer. There is interest in forward Jota Silva, of Vitoria de Guimaraes in Portugal, and Juventus winger Matias Soule. Last season, West Ham had the second oldest squad in the Premier League with an average age of 28.2 - only Fulham were older. They are keen to bring that down for the start of Lopetegui's reign.\n\nSupporters' first glimpse of Guilherme could be in the pre-season friendly against Dagenham & Redbridge on July 20. Where Guilherme plays could indicate the position Lopetegui believes his new signing is best suited.\n\n\"Sometimes the fans wanted to see Luis play in midfield because that's the position he was initially taught to play in,\" says Camila Alves, a journalist for Ge. \"But the manager saw something in him as a forward. Luis does need to work on his finishing because this is where he has struggled. Sometimes he's been in Endrick's shadow, which hasn't helped.\n\n\"There was a time when Guilherme's development was a bit stop-start and he would be left on the bench. But things started to click and then the expectation was he would be sold soon. He's a very promising talent and over time, he could develop into a really good player. West Ham is a right fit for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roshane_thomas@nytimes.com", "name": "Roshane Thomas",

He provided 14 goal contributions in just his first full season in the top flight and his performances have attracted a lot of interest from clubs across Europe.\n\nAccording to Romano, West Ham are \"showing concrete interest\" in the youngster as they step up efforts in reinforcing their squad ahead of the coming season.\n\nRomano reports the Hammers have been keeping tabs on the Argentine's progress in the Serie A last season and there's a possibility the South American could leave this summer.\n\nThe Italian transfer guru adds that the Bianconeri are considering all options as the player could depart if they receive a lucrative offer.\n\nSoul\u00e9 is contracted with the 36-time Italian Champions until 2026 with a \u20ac25 (\u00a321m) valuation according to Transfermarkt. The price could prove to be a bargain deal for the Hammers if they beat off competition from other interested clubs to secure the signing of the highly-rated Argentina u23 international.\n\nWest Ham eye Soul\u00e9 swoop\n\nWest Ham are gearing up for a fresh start to life under new head coach Julen Lopetegui and plans have already begun to reinforce their squad ahead of the coming season.\n\nThey have already agreed a deal to sign Brazilian gem Luis Guilherme from Palmeiras and moves are being initiated to secure other targets. The East London club have now set their sights on one of South America's brightest prospects, Soul\u00e9.\n\nThe youngster was one of the best wingers in the Italian top flight last season, constantly wowing the crowd with scintillating displays down the right flank.\n\nAn Argentine by birth and an Italian by citizenship, Soul\u00e9's skillset is characterized by his dribbling ability - but he's beyond that - the 21-year-old is creative with a knit eye for defence-splitting passes.\n\nWest Ham already have Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen in the right-wing position, and it will be interesting to watch how Lopetegui will utilise the youngster if he ends up moving to the London Stadium.\n\nRelated TopicsJuventusMatias SoulePremier LeagueTransfer RumoursWest Ham United Home \" Premier League \" West Ham indicate interest in Juventus youngster Matias Soule", "source": {"uri": "football-talk.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football Talk | Premier League News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_akpan@football-talk.co.uk", "name": "Max Akpan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosinone_Calcio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frosinone Calcio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfermarkt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transfermarkt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Kudus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Kudus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_Palmeiras", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Radio/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Radio/Amateur", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://football-talk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/west_ham_london-stadium-e1594392553301.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648406", "eventUri": "eng-9648406", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The Hammers have also made an offer for Corinthians' 'fearsome' \u00a325 million-rated winger Wesley Gassova, although that pursuit has been complicated after Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen threw their hat into the ring.\n\nFabricio Bruno, meanwhile, appears increasingly unlikely to be wearing the claret and blue next season after talks ran aground over personal terms. HITC have been told that the 28-year-old Copa Libertadores winner wanted an eye-watering \u00a3100,000-a-week at West Ham.\n\nSuch a wage, per Spotrac, would have made Bruno one of the clubs' highest earners, ahead of Mohamed Kudus, Thomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen.\n\nThis blow comes after Bruno's agent claimed that - despite reports that a \u00a315 million transfer was close (The Guardian) - there was still a lot of work to be done before the late-blooming centre-half could be confirmed as a West Ham player.\n\n\"Fabricio and Flamengo received a proposal from West Ham,\" one of Bruno's agents told Itatiaia in midweek. \"But there is still no agreement between all parties for a transfer to be completed.\"\n\nOnly three teams - the relegated trio of Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton Town - conceded more goals than West Ham in 2023/24, a tally of 74 playing a major part in David Moyes' dismissal. Kurt Zouma and Nayef Aguerd endured difficult campaigns, while former Arsenal prospect Konstantinos Mavropanos is yet to live up to his \u00a319 million price-tag.\n\nFabricio Bruno would have helped improve a dismal defensive record, earning both of his Brazil caps in 2024 and impressing during a 1-0 win at Wembley over Gareth Southgate's England in March.\n\nIf the deal is to be revived, the former Red Bull Bragantino man may have to reduce his wage demands in order to get his 'dream' switch to the Premier League.\n\n\"I'm rooting for him,\" fellow Flamengo ace Leo Ortiz told Globo Esporte when talks over Bruno's switch to the London Stadium appeared to be progressing in the right direction. \"(The move) is good for him. It's a dream for him too.\n\n\"He's already made that clear, he's already expressed that.

Silva scored 11 goals last season for Vitoria Guimaraes, attracting interest from West Ham and Roma. Silva's arrival would address West Ham's small squad and provide an invaluable rotation option.\n\nWest Ham United have been one of the most proactive sides in the Premier League this summer already after venturing into the Brazilian market - and they could add to their ranks with links to Portuguese star Jota Silva, who has been dubbed the 'Portuguese Jack Grealish'.\n\nA move for Flamengo defender Fabricio Bruno broke down, but that hasn't stopped club chiefs from their scouting spree in Brazil ending without result, with a deal for Luis Guilherme said to be close to completion. New boss Julen Lopetegui has now made his intentions clear to spend in the market and he could opt for a move for Silva, who has impressed in the Primeira Liga this year.\n\nJota Silva: West Ham Transfer Latest The winger has been linked with a move to London\n\nThe report from talkSPORT suggests that West Ham have been offered the chance to sign Silva from Vit\u00f3ria Guimaraes - who has been coined with the nickname of the 'Portuguese Grealish'.\n\nWest Ham are close to completing a deal for Guilherme in the region of \u00a330million, but that won't stop them from signing other players in attacking positions, with sporting director Tim Steidten weighing up whether to pursue a move for Silva.\n\nRoma are also said to be interested in his services, though he would prefer a move to the Premier League - with West Ham in need of squad depth in the wide areas, as only Jarrod Bowen, Maxwel Cornet and the incoming Guilherme will be able to play there heading into pre-season.\n\nJota Silva's Primiera Liga statistics - Vitoria Guimaraes squad ranking\n\nStats\n\nOutput\n\nSquad rank\n\nGoals\n\n11\n\n1st\n\nAssists\n\n5\n\n=1st\n\nKey Passes Per Game\n\n1\n\n=4th\n\nDribbles Per Game\n\n1.3\n\n1st\n\nShots Per Game\n\n2.9\n\n1st\n\nMatch rating\n\n7.12\n\n1st\n\nSilva scored 11 goals last season in the league alone for Vitoria, notching five assists and even scoring in the Europa Conference League qualifying rounds, despite an exit to NK Celje. 11 strikes for a side that finished in fifth meant that he was one of the most influential players in the league throughout the campaign and after making his Portugal debut back in March, Silva is wanted property throughout Europe, though it remains to be seen if he will make the switch to east London.\n\nAt just 24 years of age and adept at playing on either wing and behind the striker, he flourishes best out wide and that could be a reason for West Ham to sign him as a valuable rotation option.\n\nSilva Is Exactly What West Ham Need The Hammers don't have nearly enough squad depth\n\nThe Irons do have Bowen who is able to play on the right flank and that could limit Silva's game time, but with Lucas Paqueta having been charged by the FA for breaching gambling rules, his involvement at the London Stadium could dwindle in the future and as a result, Silva could come in to replace him.\n\nOne of West Ham's biggest problems is that their squad is impressively small. That has its benefits in terms of a team gelling together but in the long-run, injuries can massively disrupt a season and with little to no backup for some of their star players, the Irons will be needing rotation options such as Silva to come in and feature when needed.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Jota Silva has 30 goal contributions in 82 games for Vitoria Guimaraes\n\nThe club conceded the fourth-highest amount of goals in the Premier League last season, behind only the relegated trio of Luton Town, Burnley and Sheffield United, and if they were to suffer further injuries in the attacking areas of the pitch, it could cause an almighty collapse.\n\nLopetegui will be able to recognise that and as a result, if the Irons do take up the signing of Silva, it could show fans what the Spaniard is trying to achieve in his stint at the helm.\n\nRelated West Ham Should Complete Deal for Star by Thursday West Ham United are pushing to secure the signature of Palmeiras star Luis Guilherme.\n\nStatistics courtesy of WhoScored.

David Sullivan, West Ham's owner, was reluctant to sanction a \u00a330 million bid for the Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United target, despite having already put \u00a325 million on the table.\n\nThis comes after Julen Lopetegui's team pulled the plug on the arrival of Fabricio Bruno too. West Ham reportedly agreed a fee rising to \u00a315 million with Flamengo.\n\nBut, in a rather unusual turn of events, personal terms proved to be the issue, Bruno's demands of a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract having The Hammers running for the hills.\n\nSpeaking to UOL, Flamengo's vice president Marcos Braz has now opened up on this somewhat surprising development. Bruno, he says, wanted the move initially, the breakdown in discussions a 'pleasant surprise' for the Brazil international's current employers.\n\n\"Flamengo listened to the businesspeople, who are the people who take care of Fabricio's career,\" Braz explains. \"They told us that the player was interested in going to England.\n\n\"We sat down, as we do with everyone. We agreed with the team and on the spot. (But) there was no agreement between the club and the player.\n\n\"This is difficult because, usually when you talk to the club, the player's situation is already advanced. For us, it was a pleasant surprise. I prefer Fabricio (to stay) here.\"\n\nWest Ham's loss, Braz says, is very much Flamengo's gain.\n\nSnapped up from Red Bull Bragantino in 2022, Bruno has developed into one of the continent's finest central defenders, forcing his way into the Brazil squad for this summer's Copa America and impressing during March's 1-0 win over England at Wembley.\n\n\"He's a player who was called up to the national team. We looked at him at Bragantino, he came in well, he adapted super. Everyone likes him. He's very important for our squad,\" Braz adds.\n\n\"Of course, the money would be good but there's no problem. We are very happy with Fabricio Bruno staying.\"\n\nWest Ham conceded a staggering 74 goals in the 2023/24 Premier League season.

The 18-year-old Brazilian youth international joins just six months after helping his boyhood club clinch the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A title.\n\nDespite his young age, Luis Guilherme has already achieved a great deal. Last season's Brazilian title is a significant accomplishment, but it's just one highlight in a string of successes. Additional honours include the Campeonato Paulista (S\u00e3o Paulo's state championship) and several youth titles with Palmeiras, and the South American U20 Championship with Brazil.\n\nThese successes are testament not only to his talent, but also his composure in high-pressure situations. A standout example of this was his 95th-minute winner against Independiente del Valle in the Copa Libertadores back in April. Showcasing a blend of calmness and brilliance rarely seen in players so young, he came off the bench with his side 2-1 down and half an hour still to play and successfully overturned the deficit to secure a crucial three points on the road.", "source": {"uri": "whufc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Ham United Football Club"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Guilherme", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luis Guilherme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_Palmeiras", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Paulista", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campeonato Paulista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Brasileiro_S\u00e9rie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Libertadores", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Libertadores"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.S.D._Independiente_del_Valle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C.S.D.

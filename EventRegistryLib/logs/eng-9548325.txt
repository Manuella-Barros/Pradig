(AP) - The nation\u00b4s largest public utility is moving ahead with a plan for a new natural gas plant in Tennessee despite warnings that its environmental review of the project doesn't comply with federal law. The Tennessee Valley Authority announced in April that it would replace the aging coal-burning Kingston Fossil Plant with gas amid growing calls for the agency's new board of directors to invest in renewables.\n\nThe board, with six of nine members appointed by President Biden, is expected to meet on Thursday in Nashville, a day after a planned protest by a coalition of environmental groups demanding Tennessee Valley stop investing in fossil fuels.\n\nDecommissioning the Kingston plant, site of a massive 2008 coal ash spill, is part of Tennessee Valley's overall plan to reduce its reliance on coal. In analyzing alternatives to replace the plant, the corporation considered either a new 1,500 megawatt gas plant or 1,500 megawatts of solar combined with 2,200 megawatts of battery storage. Tennessee Valley concluded that a 2027 deadline for retiring the current plant does not give it enough time to develop the renewables alternative.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency asked Tennessee Valley in a March 25 letter to redo several aspects of its analysis, citing \"numerous\" concerns with the plan to install new gas turbines. Among other things, the EPA accused the utility of defining the Kingston project so narrowly that only its predetermined choice of a new gas plant would meet the parameters, making the corporation's evaluation process a \"foreordained formality.\" EPA said the utility did not adequately explain the need for the 2027 closure or look at possible alternatives.\n\nThe EPA said that Tennessee Valley's environmental review does not adhere to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies like Tennessee Valley to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions before making a decision.\n\nTennessee Valley, which is an independent federal agency, declined to follow EPA's suggestion for a do-over. It decided in April to forge ahead with gas - continuing to follow a plan of action that the EPA says fails to take into account recent changes in the energy sector, including falling prices for renewables, billions of federal dollars for clean energy projects, and ever stricter environmental regulations. The corporation remains off track to meet the Biden administration's goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035.\n\nTennessee Valley said in a statement that \"we met with EPA following the letter and addressed their concerns.\" EPA, meanwhile, maintained in an email to The Associated Press that its request that Tennessee Valley revise its environmental impact statement still stands.\n\nDennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said even with Tennessee Valley's 2027 deadline, \"They could build twice the amount of solar that they say they need and twice the amount of battery storage they say they need.\"\n\nOther utilities are taking advantage of price drops, technical improvements and government incentives to build out solar, including in Texas and Florida.\n\nBy 2030, Florida Power and Light expects solar to account for close to 40% of its generation, Wamsted said.\n\n\"This is a big utility with, you know, the same daily responsibilities as TVA,\" he said. \"And they are building out solar as fast as they can.\"\n\nTennessee Valley provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states. Florida Power and Light serves over 12 million people in that state.\n\nEven if solar doesn't produce power 24 hours per day, the amount of energy it does produce is knowable and can be planned for, Wamsted said. It can also be paired with batteries that store excess energy during the day to release back to the grid at night. That is already happening on a large scale in California where batteries are providing more than 20% of the power in the system on many evenings, he said.\n\nIn Wamsted's view, many utilities resist the transition to renewables primarily because they are unfamiliar.\n\nHe points to an area called the Southwest Power Pool that runs from Oklahoma to Canada and now sees days where 60% or 70% of the system is wind-powered. In the late 2000s, he spoke to grid operators there who were afraid to go above 5% or 10% because they had never done it before, he said.\n\nTennessee Valley's Kingston project is not its first clash with the EPA over gas. The environmental regulator made many of the same criticisms a year ago when the corporation decided to build a new 1,450-megawatt natural gas plant at its coal-burning Cumberland Fossil Plant. The Sierra Club and other groups are suing over that decision as well as an earlier one to install gas turbines at a retired coal plant in New Johnsonville. Both lawsuits claim that Tennessee Valley's environmental reviews are perfunctory, in violation of the law - similar to the EPA's criticism of the Kingston plant.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, a frequent Tennessee Valley critic, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the corporation should listen to the EPA.\n\n\"The National Environmental Policy Act isn\u00b4t optional - it\u00b4s the bedrock of our environmental protection and community engagement laws,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Tennessee Valley has not embraced renewables, the utility still says a majority of its energy is carbon-free because 42% comes from nuclear and another 9% is from hydropower. Purchased wind and solar make up another 4% of its energy portfolio. The corporation currently produces 1 megawatt of its own solar and has 20 megawatts of battery storage. It estimates that the new gas plant will produce 1.68 million tons of greenhouse gases a year, noting that that is a steep decline from Kingston's current emissions.\n\nNationally, coal provided about 16% of U.S. electricity last year, down from about 45% in 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority has said it intends to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035. Wamsted contends that is too far in the future.\n\n\"It should be, 'We\u00b4re going to build as much solar as we possibly can now,\u00b4 because it\u00b4s now that we really need to worry about,\" he said. \"We don\u00b4t need to worry about 10 years from now or 15 years from now.\"\n\n____\n\nJonathan Mattise contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- The nation's largest public utility is moving ahead with a plan for a new natural gas plant in Tennessee despite warnings that its environmental review of the project doesn't comply with federal law. The Tennessee Valley Authority announced in April that it would replace the aging coal-burning Kingston Fossil Plant with gas amid growing calls for the agency's new board of directors to invest in renewables.\n\nThe board, with six of nine members appointed by President Biden, is expected to meet on Thursday in Nashville, a day after a planned protest by a coalition of environmental groups demanding Tennessee Valley stop investing in fossil fuels.\n\nDecommissioning the Kingston plant, site of a massive 2008 coal ash spill, is part of Tennessee Valley's overall plan to reduce its reliance on coal. In analyzing alternatives to replace the plant, the corporation considered either a new 1,500 megawatt gas plant or 1,500 megawatts of solar combined with 2,200 megawatts of battery storage. Tennessee Valley concluded that a 2027 deadline for retiring the current plant does not give it enough time to develop the renewables alternative.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency asked Tennessee Valley in a March 25 letter to redo several aspects of its analysis, citing \"numerous\" concerns with the plan to install new gas turbines. Among other things, the EPA accused the utility of defining the Kingston project so narrowly that only its predetermined choice of a new gas plant would meet the parameters, making the corporation's evaluation process a \"foreordained formality.\" EPA said the utility did not adequately explain the need for the 2027 closure or look at possible alternatives.\n\nThe EPA said that Tennessee Valley's environmental review does not adhere to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies like Tennessee Valley to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions before making a decision.\n\nTennessee Valley, which is an independent federal agency, declined to follow EPA's suggestion for a do-over. It decided in April to forge ahead with gas -- continuing to follow a plan of action that the EPA says fails to take into account recent changes in the energy sector, including falling prices for renewables, billions of federal dollars for clean energy projects, and ever stricter environmental regulations. The corporation remains off track to meet the Biden administration's goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035.\n\nTennessee Valley said in a statement that \"we met with EPA following the letter and addressed their concerns.\" EPA, meanwhile, maintained in an email to The Associated Press that its request that Tennessee Valley revise its environmental impact statement still stands.\n\nDennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said even with Tennessee Valley's 2027 deadline, \"They could build twice the amount of solar that they say they need and twice the amount of battery storage they say they need.\"\n\nOther utilities are taking advantage of price drops, technical improvements and government incentives to build out solar, including in Texas and Florida.\n\nBy 2030, Florida Power and Light expects solar to account for close to 40% of its generation, Wamsted said.\n\n\"This is a big utility with, you know, the same daily responsibilities as TVA,\" he said. \"And they are building out solar as fast as they can.\"\n\nTennessee Valley provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states. Florida Power and Light serves over 12 million people in that state.\n\nEven if solar doesn't produce power 24 hours per day, the amount of energy it does produce is knowable and can be planned for, Wamsted said. It can also be paired with batteries that store excess energy during the day to release back to the grid at night. That is already happening on a large scale in California where batteries are providing more than 20% of the power in the system on many evenings, he said.\n\nIn Wamsted's view, many utilities resist the transition to renewables primarily because they are unfamiliar.\n\nHe points to an area called the Southwest Power Pool that runs from Oklahoma to Canada and now sees days where 60% or 70% of the system is wind-powered. In the late 2000s, he spoke to grid operators there who were afraid to go above 5% or 10% because they had never done it before, he said.\n\nTennessee Valley's Kingston project is not its first clash with the EPA over gas. The environmental regulator made many of the same criticisms a year ago when the corporation decided to build a new 1,450-megawatt natural gas plant at its coal-burning Cumberland Fossil Plant. The Sierra Club and other groups are suing over that decision as well as an earlier one to install gas turbines at a retired coal plant in New Johnsonville. Both lawsuits claim that Tennessee Valley's environmental reviews are perfunctory, in violation of the law -- similar to the EPA's criticism of the Kingston plant.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, a frequent Tennessee Valley critic, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the corporation should listen to the EPA.\n\n\"The National Environmental Policy Act isn't optional -- it's the bedrock of our environmental protection and community engagement laws,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Tennessee Valley has not embraced renewables, the utility still says a majority of its energy is carbon-free because 42% comes from nuclear and another 9% is from hydropower.

Wamsted contends that is too far in the future.\n\n\"It should be, 'We're going to build as much solar as we possibly can now,' because it's now that we really need to worry about,\" he said. \"We don't need to worry about 10 years from now or 15 years from now.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

That is already happening on a large scale in California where batteries are providing more than 20% of the power in the system on many evenings, he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Wamsted's view, many utilities resist the transition to renewables primarily because they are unfamiliar.\n\nHe points to an area called the Southwest Power Pool that runs from Oklahoma to Canada and now sees days where 60% or 70% of the system is wind-powered. In the late 2000s, he spoke to grid operators there who were afraid to go above 5% or 10% because they had never done it before, he said.\n\nTennessee Valley's Kingston project is not its first clash with the EPA over gas. The environmental regulator made many of the same criticisms a year ago when the corporation decided to build a new 1,450-megawatt natural gas plant at its coal-burning Cumberland Fossil Plant. The Sierra Club and other groups are suing over that decision as well as an earlier one to install gas turbines at a retired coal plant in New Johnsonville. Both lawsuits claim that Tennessee Valley's environmental reviews are perfunctory, in violation of the law -- similar to the EPA's criticism of the Kingston plant.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, a frequent Tennessee Valley critic, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the corporation should listen to the EPA.\n\n\"The National Environmental Policy Act isn't optional -- it's the bedrock of our environmental protection and community engagement laws,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAlthough Tennessee Valley has not embraced renewables, the utility still says a majority of its energy is carbon-free because 42% comes from nuclear and another 9% is from hydropower. Purchased wind and solar make up another 4% of its energy portfolio. The corporation currently produces 1 megawatt of its own solar and has 20 megawatts of battery storage. It estimates that the new gas plant will produce 1.68 million tons of greenhouse gases a year, noting that that is a steep decline from Kingston's current emissions.\n\nNationally, coal provided about 16% of U.S. electricity last year, down from about 45% in 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority has said it intends to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035. Wamsted contends that is too far in the future.\n\n\"It should be, 'We're going to build as much solar as we possibly can now,' because it's now that we really need to worry about,\" he said. \"We don't need to worry about 10 years from now or 15 years from now.\"\n\n____\n\nJonathan Mattise contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"},

The Tennessee Valley Authority announced in April that it would replace the aging coal-burning Kingston Fossil Plant with gas amid growing calls for the agency's new board of directors to invest in renewables.\n\nThe board, with six of nine members appointed by President Biden, is expected to meet on Thursday in Nashville, a day after a planned protest by a coalition of environmental groups demanding Tennessee Valley stop investing in fossil fuels.\n\nTVA seeking public input on future of its Chattanooga office complex\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is seeking community input ahead of its potential renov...\n\nDecommissioning the Kingston plant, site of a massive 2008 coal ash spill, is part of Tennessee Valley's overall plan to reduce its reliance on coal. In analyzing alternatives to replace the plant, the corporation considered either a new 1,500 megawatt gas plant or 1,500 megawatts of solar combined with 2,200 megawatts of battery storage. Tennessee Valley concluded that a 2027 deadline for retiring the current plant does not give it enough time to develop the renewables alternative.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency asked Tennessee Valley in a March 25 letter to redo several aspects of its analysis, citing \"numerous\" concerns with the plan to install new gas turbines. Among other things, the EPA accused the utility of defining the Kingston project so narrowly that only its predetermined choice of a new gas plant would meet the parameters, making the corporation's evaluation process a \"foreordained formality.\" EPA said the utility did not adequately explain the need for the 2027 closure or look at possible alternatives.\n\nThe EPA said that Tennessee Valley's environmental review does not adhere to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies like Tennessee Valley to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions before making a decision.\n\nTVA hosts public meeting over Saulpaw Mill dam site\n\nThey held a public meeting tonight, and most residents there said TVA should preserve the SaulPaw Mill Dam, citing its rich history and its sentimental value.\n\nTennessee Valley, which is an independent federal agency, declined to follow EPA's suggestion for a do-over. It decided in April to forge ahead with gas -- continuing to follow a plan of action that the EPA says fails to take into account recent changes in the energy sector, including falling prices for renewables, billions of federal dollars for clean energy projects, and ever stricter environmental regulations. The corporation remains off track to meet the Biden administration's goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035.\n\nTennessee grand jury wants criminal coal ash investigation\n\nA grand jury in Tennessee is supporting a criminal investigation into claims that a Tennessee Valley Authority contractor failed to protect workers cleaning up a massive coal ash spill.\n\nTennessee Valley said in a statement that \"we met with EPA following the letter and addressed their concerns.\" EPA, meanwhile, maintained in an email to The Associated Press that its request that Tennessee Valley revise its environmental impact statement still stands.\n\nDennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said even with Tennessee Valley's 2027 deadline, \"They could build twice the amount of solar that they say they need and twice the amount of battery storage they say they need.\"\n\nOther utilities are taking advantage of price drops, technical improvements and government incentives to build out solar, including in Texas and Florida.\n\nBy 2030, Florida Power and Light expects solar to account for close to 40% of its generation, Wamsted said.\n\n\"This is a big utility with, you know, the same daily responsibilities as TVA,\" he said. \"And they are building out solar as fast as they can.\"\n\nTVA hits peak, record-setting demand, no blackouts reported\n\nThe previous record was 33,482 megawatts, which was set in August of 2007.\n\nTennessee Valley provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states. Florida Power and Light serves over 12 million people in that state.\n\nEven if solar doesn't produce power 24 hours per day, the amount of energy it does produce is knowable and can be planned for, Wamsted said. It can also be paired with batteries that store excess energy during the day to release back to the grid at night. That is already happening on a large scale in California where batteries are providing more than 20% of the power in the system on many evenings, he said.\n\nIn Wamsted's view, many utilities resist the transition to renewables primarily because they are unfamiliar.\n\nHe points to an area called the Southwest Power Pool that runs from Oklahoma to Canada and now sees days where 60% or 70% of the system is wind-powered.

Purchased wind and solar make up another 4% of its energy portfolio. The utility currently produces 1 megawatt of its own solar and has 20 megawatts of battery storage. The Kingston project includes another 3-4 megawatts of solar and 100 megawatts of battery storage. TVA estimates that the new gas plant will produce 1.68 million tons (1.52 million metric tons) of greenhouse gases a year, noting that that is a steep decline from Kingston's current emissions.\n\nNationally, coal provided about 16% of U.S. electricity last year, down from about 45% in 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority has said it intends to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035.

(AP) -- The nation's largest public utility is moving ahead with a plan for a new natural gas plant in Tennessee despite warnings that its environmental review of the project doesn't comply with federal law. The Tennessee Valley Authority announced in April that it would replace the aging coal-burning Kingston Fossil Plant with gas amid growing calls for the agency's new board of directors to invest in renewables.\n\nThe board, with six of nine members appointed by President Biden, is expected to meet on Thursday in Nashville, a day after a planned protest by a coalition of environmental groups demanding Tennessee Valley stop investing in fossil fuels.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In analyzing alternatives to replace the plant, the corporation considered either a new 1,500 megawatt gas plant or 1,500 megawatts of solar combined with 2,200 megawatts of battery storage. Tennessee Valley concluded that a 2027 deadline for retiring the current plant does not give it enough time to develop the renewables alternative.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency asked Tennessee Valley in a March 25 letter to redo several aspects of its analysis, citing \"numerous\" concerns with the plan to install new gas turbines. Among other things, the EPA accused the utility of defining the Kingston project so narrowly that only its predetermined choice of a new gas plant would meet the parameters, making the corporation's evaluation process a \"foreordained formality.\" EPA said the utility did not adequately explain the need for the 2027 closure or look at possible alternatives.\n\nThe EPA said that Tennessee Valley's environmental review does not adhere to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies like Tennessee Valley to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions before making a decision.\n\nTennessee Valley, which is an independent federal agency, declined to follow EPA's suggestion for a do-over. It decided in April to forge ahead with gas -- continuing to follow a plan of action that the EPA says fails to take into account recent changes in the energy sector, including falling prices for renewables, billions of federal dollars for clean energy projects, and ever stricter environmental regulations. The corporation remains off track to meet the Biden administration's goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035.\n\nTennessee Valley said in a statement that \"we met with EPA following the letter and addressed their concerns.\" EPA, meanwhile, maintained in an email to The Associated Press that its request that Tennessee Valley revise its environmental impact statement still stands.\n\nDennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said even with Tennessee Valley's 2027 deadline, \"They could build twice the amount of solar that they say they need and twice the amount of battery storage they say they need.\"\n\nOther utilities are taking advantage of price drops, technical improvements and government incentives to build out solar, including in Texas and Florida.\n\nBy 2030, Florida Power and Light expects solar to account for close to 40% of its generation, Wamsted said.\n\n\"This is a big utility with, you know, the same daily responsibilities as TVA,\" he said. \"And they are building out solar as fast as they can.\"\n\nTennessee Valley provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states. Florida Power and Light serves over 12 million people in that state.\n\nEven if solar doesn't produce power 24 hours per day, the amount of energy it does produce is knowable and can be planned for, Wamsted said. It can also be paired with batteries that store excess energy during the day to release back to the grid at night. That is already happening on a large scale in California where batteries are providing more than 20% of the power in the system on many evenings, he said.\n\nIn Wamsted's view, many utilities resist the transition to renewables primarily because they are unfamiliar.\n\nHe points to an area called the Southwest Power Pool that runs from Oklahoma to Canada and now sees days where 60% or 70% of the system is wind-powered. In the late 2000s, he spoke to grid operators there who were afraid to go above 5% or 10% because they had never done it before, he said.\n\nTennessee Valley's Kingston project is not its first clash with the EPA over gas. The environmental regulator made many of the same criticisms a year ago when the corporation decided to build a new 1,450-megawatt natural gas plant at its coal-burning Cumberland Fossil Plant. The Sierra Club and other groups are suing over that decision as well as an earlier one to install gas turbines at a retired coal plant in New Johnsonville. Both lawsuits claim that Tennessee Valley's environmental reviews are perfunctory, in violation of the law -- similar to the EPA's criticism of the Kingston plant.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, a frequent Tennessee Valley critic, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the corporation should listen to the EPA.\n\n\"The National Environmental Policy Act isn't optional -- it's the bedrock of our environmental protection and community engagement laws,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Tennessee Valley has not embraced renewables, the utility still says a majority of its energy is carbon-free because 42% comes from nuclear and another 9% is from hydropower. Purchased wind and solar make up another 4% of its energy portfolio. The corporation currently produces 1 megawatt of its own solar and has 20 megawatts of battery storage. It estimates that the new gas plant will produce 1.68 million tons of greenhouse gases a year, noting that that is a steep decline from Kingston's current emissions.\n\nNationally, coal provided about 16% of U.S. electricity last year, down from about 45% in 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority has said it intends to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035. Wamsted contends that is too far in the future.\n\n\"It should be, 'We're going to build as much solar as we possibly can now,' because it's now that we really need to worry about,\" he said. \"We don't need to worry about 10 years from now or 15 years from now.\"\n\nJonathan Mattise contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In analyzing alternatives to replace the plant, the utility considered either a new 1,500-megawatt gas plant or 1,500 megawatts of solar combined with 2,200 megawatts of battery storage.\n\nAlso Read | Israel-Gaza Conflict: Israel Reopens Kerem Shalom Border Crossing for Delivery of Aid to War-Torn Nation.\n\nTVA concluded that a 2027 deadline for retiring the current plant does not give it enough time to develop the renewables alternative.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asked the utility in a March 25 letter to redo several aspects of its analysis, citing \"numerous\" concerns with the plan to install new gas turbines.\n\nAmong other things, the EPA accused the utility of defining the Kingston project so narrowly that only its predetermined choice of a new gas plant would meet the parameters, making the evaluation process a \"foreordained formality.\" EPA said the utility did not adequately explain the need for the 2027 closure or look at possible alternatives.\n\nThe EPA said the environmental review does not meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies like the Tennessee Valley Authority to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions before making a decision.\n\nTVA declined to follow the Environmental Protection Agency's suggestion for a do-over. It decided in April to forge ahead with gas -- continuing to follow a plan of action that the EPA says fails to consider recent changes in the energy sector, including falling prices for renewables, billions of federal dollars for clean energy projects, and ever stricter environmental regulations.\n\nThe corporation remains off track to meet the Biden administration's goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 to try to limit the effects of climate change.\n\nThe utility said in a statement that \"we met with EPA following the letter and addressed their concerns.\" EPA, meanwhile, maintained in an email to The Associated Press that its request that TVA revise its environmental impact statement still stands.\n\nDennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said even with TVA's 2027 deadline, \"They could build twice the amount of solar that they say they need and twice the amount of battery storage they say they need.\"\n\nOther utilities are taking advantage of price drops, technical improvements and government incentives to build out solar, including in Texas and Florida.\n\nBy 2030, Florida Power and Light expects solar to account for close to 40 per cent of its generation, Wamsted said.\n\n\"This is a big utility with, you know, the same daily responsibilities as TVA,\" he said. \"And they are building out solar as fast as they can.\"\n\nTVA provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states. Florida Power and Light serves over 12 million people in that state.\n\nNationally, coal provided about 16 per cent of US electricity last year, down from about 45 per cent in 2010. Natural gas provides about 43 per cent of US electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority has said it intends to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035. Wamsted contends that is too far in the future.\n\n\"It should be, We're going to build as much solar as we possibly can now,' because it's now that we really need to worry about,\" he said. \"We don't need to worry about 10 years from now or 15 years from now.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) - The nation's largest public utility on Thursday pledged to be more transparent after it took months to disclose that a general budget vote by its board last year also gave the CEO the final decision over several proposed natural gas power plants.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority's board announced the transparency changes during its quarterly meeting in Nashville. The decision followed an August meeting in which the federal utility's board cast the budget vote that quietly gave President and CEO Jeff Lyash the final say over the projects, including the replacement of the aging coal-fired Kingston Fossil Plant with a natural gas plant.\n\nThe public didn't find out about those provisions until documents with specific details were released several months later, some via public records request, said Amanda Garcia, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.\n\nThe decision stood in contrast to a more publicized vote in May 2023 when the board, with a new majority selected by President Joe Biden, took back the final decision-making authority on the Kingston plant. Lyash had been granted the authority for Kingston and the natural gas switch at Cumberland Fossil Plant, both in Tennessee, when the board had a majority picked by former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"One of the changes the chair asked me if I would do, which I can, is to take the resolutions, precisely what is being voted by the board, and make those resolutions publicly available, get them on the website rapidly after the meeting,\" Lyash told The Associated Press.\n\nBoard member Michelle Moore, who was absent but had a statement read on her behalf, said some decisions are better delegated to the CEO because they span years and multiple board cycles, but others require board decisions because of \"exceptional, regional and even national significance.\" Additionally, Lyash said the board maintains oversight authority when the CEO is the decision maker.\n\nFILE - In this Aug. 7, 2019, photo, the Kingston Fossil Plant stands near a waterway in Kingston, Tenn. The nation's largest public utility is moving ahead with a plan for a new natural gas plant in Tennessee despite warnings that its environmental review of the project doesn't comply with federal law.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File)\n\nTVA's plans to open more natural gas plants have drawn the ire of advocates who want an aggressive move away from fossil fuels and into solar and other renewables. They note that even with six of nine board members appointed by Biden, TVA is off track to meet the Biden administration\u00b4s goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 to try to limit the effects of climate change. Several of its proposals for new natural gas plants have received criticism from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including a warning that its environmental review of the Kingston project doesn\u00b4t comply with federal law.\n\nSouthern Environmental Law Center staff attorney Trey Bussey said the transparency changes should have been in place \"before TVA decided to spend billions of dollars on new gas plants and pipelines - not after,\" adding that the board can still halt the buildout of gas plants. In April, the law center said it recently found out that the board had given decision-making power back to the CEO.\n\nAlthough TVA has not embraced renewables, the utility still says a majority of its energy is carbon-free because 42% comes from nuclear and another 9% is from hydropower. Purchased wind and solar make up another 4% of its energy portfolio. The utility currently produces 1 megawatt of its own solar and has 20 megawatts of battery storage. The Kingston project includes another 3-4 megawatts of solar and 100 megawatts of battery storage. TVA estimates that the new gas plant will produce 1.68 million tons (1.52 million metric tons) of greenhouse gases a year, noting that it is a steep decline from Kingston\u00b4s current emissions.\n\nTVA says its power mix was at 55% last fiscal year, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The utility has said it intends to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035. Its solar goals have hit some snags, including supply chain issues, interest rates and land costs, according to Lyash.\n\nAs the region grows in population and TVA looks to add power plants, the utility says it also has a goal of reducing consumption by 30% over the next decade through energy efficiency and demand response programs.\n\nTVA provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- The nation's largest public utility on Thursday pledged to be more transparent after it took months to disclose that a general budget vote by its board last year also gave the CEO the final decision over several proposed natural gas power plants.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority's board announced the transparency changes during its quarterly meeting in Nashville. The decision followed an August meeting in which the federal utility's board cast the budget vote that quietly gave President and CEO Jeff Lyash the final say over the projects, including the replacement of the aging coal-fired Kingston Fossil Plant with a natural gas plant.\n\nThe public didn't find out about those provisions until documents with specific details were released several months later, some via public records request, said Amanda Garcia, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.\n\nThe decision stood in contrast to a more publicized vote in May 2023 when the board, with a new majority selected by President Joe Biden, took back the final decision-making authority on the Kingston plant. Lyash had been granted the authority for Kingston and the natural gas switch at Cumberland Fossil Plant, both in Tennessee, when the board had a majority picked by former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"One of the changes the chair asked me if I would do, which I can, is to take the resolutions, precisely what is being voted by the board, and make those resolutions publicly available, get them on the website rapidly after the meeting,\" Lyash told The Associated Press.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBoard member Michelle Moore, who was absent but had a statement read on her behalf, said some decisions are better delegated to the CEO because they span years and multiple board cycles, but others require board decisions because of \"exceptional, regional and even national significance.\" Additionally, Lyash said the board maintains oversight authority when the CEO is the decision maker.\n\nTVA's plans to open more natural gas plants have drawn the ire of advocates who want an aggressive move away from fossil fuels and into solar and other renewables. They note that even with six of nine board members appointed by Biden, TVA is off track to meet the Biden administration's goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 to try to limit the effects of climate change. Several of its proposals for new natural gas plants have received criticism from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including a warning that its environmental review of the Kingston project doesn't comply with federal law.\n\nSouthern Environmental Law Center staff attorney Trey Bussey said the transparency changes should have been in place \"before TVA decided to spend billions of dollars on new gas plants and pipelines -- not after,\" adding that the board can still halt the buildout of gas plants. In April, the law center said it recently found out that the board had given decision-making power back to the CEO.\n\nAlthough TVA has not embraced renewables, the utility still says a majority of its energy is carbon-free because 42% comes from nuclear and another 9% is from hydropower. Purchased wind and solar make up another 4% of its energy portfolio. The utility currently produces 1 megawatt of its own solar and has 20 megawatts of battery storage. The Kingston project includes another 3-4 megawatts of solar and 100 megawatts of battery storage. TVA estimates that the new gas plant will produce 1.68 million tons (1.52 million metric tons) of greenhouse gases a year, noting that it is a steep decline from Kingston's current emissions.\n\nTVA says its power mix was at 55% last fiscal year, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The utility has said it intends to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035. Its solar goals have hit some snags, including supply chain issues, interest rates and land costs, according to Lyash.\n\nAs the region grows in population and TVA looks to add power plants, the utility says it also has a goal of reducing consumption by 30% over the next decade through energy efficiency and demand response programs.\n\nTVA provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

This decision comes amidst concerns raised by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the project's environmental review process and its alignment with federal law. Announced in April, the initiative aims to replace the aging Kingston Fossil Plant, which has been a significant coal-burning facility, with a gas-powered solution. This move is part of TVA's broader strategy to decrease its reliance on coal as an energy source.\n\nThe TVA board, which includes six members appointed by President Biden, is set to convene in Nashville. Their meeting coincides with a protest organized by environmental groups demanding an end to the utility's investment in fossil fuels. The decommissioning of the Kingston plant, notorious for a massive coal ash spill in 2008, underscores TVA's commitment to transitioning away from coal. In exploring alternatives for the plant's replacement, TVA evaluated the feasibility of a new 1,500-megawatt gas plant against a combination of 1,500 megawatts of solar power and 2,200 megawatts of battery storage.\n\nHowever, TVA concluded that the 2027 deadline to retire the current plant does not afford sufficient time to develop the renewable energy alternative. The EPA, in a letter dated March 25, urged TVA to reconsider several aspects of its analysis due to \"numerous\" concerns, particularly with the plan to install new gas turbines. The EPA criticized TVA for narrowly defining the Kingston project parameters, effectively limiting the evaluation to its predetermined choice of a gas plant. This approach was deemed a \"foreordained formality\" by the EPA, which also highlighted that TVA failed to justify the need for closing by 2027 or adequately explore possible alternatives.\n\nThe EPA pointed out that TVA's environmental review falls short of meeting the National Environmental Policy Act's requirements. This act mandates federal agencies like TVA to assess the environmental impacts of their proposed actions before making decisions. Despite these concerns, TVA opted not to heed the EPA's suggestion for a revised analysis and decided to proceed with its gas-centric plan. This decision comes amid warnings from the EPA that TVA's approach neglects recent shifts in the energy sector, including declining renewable prices, federal funding for clean energy projects, and tightening environmental regulations.\n\nTVA's current trajectory does not align with the Biden administration's goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 -- a key measure aimed at mitigating climate change effects. Although TVA claims to have addressed EPA's concerns in subsequent discussions, the EPA maintains that its request for a revised environmental impact statement remains unfulfilled.\n\nDennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, suggests that despite TVA's deadline constraints, it is feasible to significantly expand solar and battery storage capacities beyond what is currently proposed. He highlights how other utilities are capitalizing on falling prices and technological advancements in solar energy. For instance, Florida Power and Light anticipates solar energy will constitute nearly 40% of its generation capacity by 2030.\n\nTVA serves approximately 10 million people across seven Southern states, while Florida Power and Light caters to over 12 million individuals in Florida alone. The shift away from coal is evident nationally, with coal's share in US electricity generation dropping from about 45% in 2010 to around 16% last year. Natural gas currently accounts for approximately 43% of US electricity production, with nuclear energy and renewables like wind, solar, and hydropower making up the remainder.\n\nDespite setting a target to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035, critics like Wamsted argue that TVA should prioritize immediate action over long-term goals. He emphasizes the urgency of addressing current environmental challenges rather than deferring action to a later date.\n\nFor investment related articles, business news and mutual fund advise Allow

(AP) -- The nation's largest public utility on Thursday pledged to be more transparent after it took months to disclose that a general budget vote by its board last year also gave the CEO the final decision over several proposed natural gas power plants.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority's board announced the transparency changes during its quarterly meeting in Nashville. The decision followed an August meeting in which the federal utility's board cast the budget vote that quietly gave President and CEO Jeff Lyash the final say over the projects, including the replacement of the aging coal-fired Kingston Fossil Plant with a natural gas plant.\n\nThe public didn't find out about those provisions until documents with specific details were released several months later, some via public records request, said Amanda Garcia, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.\n\nThe decision stood in contrast to a more publicized vote in May 2023 when the board, with a new majority selected by President Joe Biden, took back the final decision-making authority on the Kingston plant. Lyash had been granted the authority for Kingston and the natural gas switch at Cumberland Fossil Plant, both in Tennessee, when the board had a majority picked by former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"One of the changes the chair asked me if I would do, which I can, is to take the resolutions, precisely what is being voted by the board, and make those resolutions publicly available, get them on the website rapidly after the meeting,\" Lyash told The Associated Press.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBoard member Michelle Moore, who was absent but had a statement read on her behalf, said some decisions are better delegated to the CEO because they span years and multiple board cycles, but others require board decisions because of \"exceptional, regional and even national significance.\" Additionally, Lyash said the board maintains oversight authority when the CEO is the decision maker.\n\nTVA's plans to open more natural gas plants have drawn the ire of advocates who want an aggressive move away from fossil fuels and into solar and other renewables. They note that even with six of nine board members appointed by Biden, TVA is off track to meet the Biden administration's goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 to try to limit the effects of climate change. Several of its proposals for new natural gas plants have received criticism from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including a warning that its environmental review of the Kingston project doesn't comply with federal law.\n\nSouthern Environmental Law Center staff attorney Trey Bussey said the transparency changes should have been in place \"before TVA decided to spend billions of dollars on new gas plants and pipelines -- not after,\" adding that the board can still halt the buildout of gas plants. In April, the law center said it recently found out that the board had given decision-making power back to the CEO.\n\nAlthough TVA has not embraced renewables, the utility still says a majority of its energy is carbon-free because 42% comes from nuclear and another 9% is from hydropower. Purchased wind and solar make up another 4% of its energy portfolio. The utility currently produces 1 megawatt of its own solar and has 20 megawatts of battery storage. The Kingston project includes another 3-4 megawatts of solar and 100 megawatts of battery storage. TVA estimates that the new gas plant will produce 1.68 million tons (1.52 million metric tons) of greenhouse gases a year, noting that it is a steep decline from Kingston's current emissions.\n\nTVA says its power mix was at 55% last fiscal year, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The utility has said it intends to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035.

(AP) -- The nation's largest public utility on Thursday pledged to be more transparent after it took months to disclose that a general budget vote by its board last year also gave the CEO the final decision over several proposed natural gas power plants.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority's board announced the transparency changes during its quarterly meeting in Nashville. The decision followed an August meeting in which the federal utility's board cast the budget vote that quietly gave President and CEO Jeff Lyash the final say over the projects, including the replacement of the aging coal-fired Kingston Fossil Plant with a natural gas plant.\n\nThe public didn't find out about those provisions until documents with specific details were released several months later, some via public records request, said Amanda Garcia, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.\n\nThe decision stood in contrast to a more publicized vote in May 2023 when the board, with a new majority selected by President Joe Biden, took back the final decision-making authority on the Kingston plant. Lyash had been granted the authority for Kingston and the natural gas switch at Cumberland Fossil Plant, both in Tennessee, when the board had a majority picked by former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"One of the changes the chair asked me if I would do, which I can, is to take the resolutions, precisely what is being voted by the board, and make those resolutions publicly available, get them on the website rapidly after the meeting,\" Lyash told The Associated Press.\n\nBoard member Michelle Moore, who was absent but had a statement read on her behalf, said some decisions are better delegated to the CEO because they span years and multiple board cycles, but others require board decisions because of \"exceptional, regional and even national significance.\" Additionally, Lyash said the board maintains oversight authority when the CEO is the decision maker.\n\nTVA's plans to open more natural gas plants have drawn the ire of advocates who want an aggressive move away from fossil fuels and into solar and other renewables. They note that even with six of nine board members appointed by Biden, TVA is off track to meet the Biden administration's goal of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 to try to limit the effects of climate change. Several of its proposals for new natural gas plants have received criticism from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including a warning that its environmental review of the Kingston project doesn't comply with federal law.\n\nSouthern Environmental Law Center staff attorney Trey Bussey said the transparency changes should have been in place \"before TVA decided to spend billions of dollars on new gas plants and pipelines -- not after,\" adding that the board can still halt the buildout of gas plants. In April, the law center said it recently found out that the board had given decision-making power back to the CEO.\n\nAlthough TVA has not embraced renewables, the utility still says a majority of its energy is carbon-free because 42% comes from nuclear and another 9% is from hydropower. Purchased wind and solar make up another 4% of its energy portfolio. The utility currently produces 1 megawatt of its own solar and has 20 megawatts of battery storage. The Kingston project includes another 3-4 megawatts of solar and 100 megawatts of battery storage. TVA estimates that the new gas plant will produce 1.68 million tons (1.52 million metric tons) of greenhouse gases a year, noting that it is a steep decline from Kingston's current emissions.\n\nTVA says its power mix was at 55% last fiscal year, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The utility has said it intends to build 10,000 megawatts of solar by 2035. Its solar goals have hit some snags, including supply chain issues, interest rates and land costs, according to Lyash.\n\nAs the region grows in population and TVA looks to add power plants, the utility says it also has a goal of reducing consumption by 30% over the next decade through energy efficiency and demand response programs.\n\nTVA provides power to 10 million people across seven Southern states.\n\nTags Wire Tennessee Valley Authority Gas Plant Corporate Management Utilities Climate And Environment Business U.s.

Tierney quickly became a hit with Arsenal fans after his \u00a325m move from Celtic in 2019 and was a regular in the first team over his first four seasons with the club. However, injuries were hampering his progress and the arrivals of both Oleksandr ZInchenko and Jurrien Timber suggested the Scot was slipping down the pecking order under Mikel Arteta. The 27-year-old spent the season just gone on loan at Real Sociedad, not really establishing himself as a regular, making 14 starts in La Liga over the campaign. He now returns to Arsenal with two years still to run on his contract in north London, but the Gunners are happy for him to move on this summer. The Sunday Post reports that \u00a310m will be enough for any interested party to sign Tierney in the upcoming transfer window, with former club Celtic linked with a move. Despite the seemingly cheap price, it could still be a push for Celtic to pull off, especially given the Premier League wages Tierney earns at Arsenal. Tierney had been a big part of Mikel Arteta\u2019s plans, but no longer (Picture: Getty Images) Newcastle and Aston Villa have been credited with interest in Tierney in the past and could still see the Scot as a boost to their squads this summer. Speaking in April, Tierney seemed to admit that his future was set to be away from the Emirates, although would not rule out returning to Arteta\u2019s side. \u2018It\u2019s hard to put a finger exactly on it [why he left Arsenal to join Real Sociedad on loan], but just the way things had developed at Arsenal, the way the team was going and what had happened last season with game-time etc.\u2019 Tierney told talkSPORT. \u2018It probably worked best for both parties that I got out and get a new experience, some game-time. \u2018When you don\u2019t play you do lose a bit of your confidence so to come over here and get that back as well has been great.\u2019 Asked if a return to Arsenal could be on the cards, Tierney replied: \u2018You never know in football. It\u2019s probably quite rare that it happens when you come back from a loan. \u2018Of course, you\u2019ve got circumstances like Saliba where they\u2019ve just come back and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been out the team since. \u2018But it\u2019s maybe a bit different for someone who has played four years already and goes back, but you genuinely never know. Football is a mad place so let\u2019s see what happens.\u2019 For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

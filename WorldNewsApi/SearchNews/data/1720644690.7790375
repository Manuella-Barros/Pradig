The model and cookbook author, 38, denied having fillers in a series of videos posted on her Instagram Stories on Saturday, June 8. Responding to a medical professional who had accused her of having work done, Teigen asked in a first clip, \u201cWould you trust a doctor that couldn't tell filler from weight gain? I personally wouldn't.\u201d \u201cAnd also, my doctor would never, ever, hang out on Instagram and dissect people's faces \u2026 he's too busy working,\" she added.

Those kinds of critiques only serve to make the person you're talking about not want to smile and show their natural joy because they think that people are going to make fun of them because of their bone structure, maybe their teeth, their lips, how they look when they smile,\" Teigen continued in a second video. \u201cLike, what does this really do, other than truly steal somebody else's joy? Literally,\u201d the mother of four added. \u201cSo that stinks. And you aren't a bad person, but what you said stinks, and maybe you'll think about it from now on.\" Teigen has been open about cosmetic procedures she has undergone in the past. In September 2021, she shared on her Instagram Stories that she had fat removed from her cheeks in a procedure called buccal fat removal, which gave her a more defined jawline. Two months later, Teigen underwent eyebrow transplant surgery \u2014 where hairs were plucked from the back of her head and placed along the shape of her brows, creating a fuller look. Teigen then revealed more of her cosmetic procedures earlier this year while appearing on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. There, she confirmed she\u2019s had three boob jobs. \u201cI feel like the boob job thing is never going to come back around and now no one\u2019s going to know,\u201d she said on the show. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lift, a put in, a take them out. I don\u2019t like them out.\u201d Teigen \u2014 who shares children Wren, 7 months, Miles, 5, Esti, 12 months, and Luna, 7, with husband John Legend \u2014 previously revealed she\u2019d had breast implants at age 20 in an interview with Glamour UK in March 2020. \"It was more for a swimsuit thing,\" Teigen told the publication. \"I thought if I'm going to be posing, laid on my back, I want them to be perky! But then you have babies and they fill up with milk and deflate and now I am screwed.\u201d", "summary": "&#34;Those kinds of critiques only serve to make the person you&#39;re talking about not want to smile and show their natural joy,&#34; the model said", "url": "https://people.com/chrissy-teigen-hits-back-at-critic-who-accuses-her-of-having-fillers-8660482", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/hRmvvjucsiJ2havUIqUzxcoT0s8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1068x322:1070x324)/chrissy-teigen-060824-7feba26529144c3981de1de1c14c5f12.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:43:20", "author": "Escher Walcott", "authors": ["Escher Walcott"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.375}

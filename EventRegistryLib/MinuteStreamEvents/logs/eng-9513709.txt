It's that Kimberlyn drives her, connecting the political message to the personal and to the friendship in a really beautiful way.\"\n\nBy the end of the episode, Sadie is back at her homebase hotel with Kimberlyn, Grace (Carla Gugino), and Lola (Natasha Behnam) who support her as she goes through the abortion experience, proving that no matter how frustrating or difficult the red tape might be, that women can persist against uneven odds.

After telling the other women about her dilemma in the beginning of Thursday's episode, she also shared that the doctor could send the pills to a P.O. box in Illinois, four hours away. Kimberlyn (Christina Elmore), the conservative reporter in the group, was the only one with a valid drivers license and offered to drive her, much to the group's surprise.\n\n\"I might not agree with the choice but it doesn't mean that I can't be there for my friend,\" she told her.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Mimoun and Benoist open up about the pivotal storyline, how it was different from telling the story in 2001 and the importance of normalizing the situation.\n\nRina, at what part in your process did this storyline become part of Sadie's arc?\n\nRina Mimoun: I think whenever you have a show that features four women, the subject of your healthcare, your reproductive rights, is going to come up. It's almost impossible that it wouldn't, quite frankly. [Creator] Amy [Chozick] was very kind about it because it wasn't necessarily on her radar. There are so many things that we're balancing in this show, but I did raise my hand early and say, I really think, given the state of the world right now, if someone got pregnant while they were on that bus and did not want to have it, how would that work? What would happen? A lot of what I was learning about through Amy is they have no autonomy over their lives. To get out of the path is a really big struggle. If it's a struggle just to get to a CVS to get a pregnancy test in the first place, how much of a struggle would it be now, considering how difficult it is to get an abortion if you want one? How impossible would that be as you're traveling across the country? We talked about it with every single one of the characters. Which character makes the most sense? We ultimately landed on Sadie, but I don't even know that Sadie was our first choice.\n\nMelissa Benoist: I thought it made a lot of sense for Sadie. As Rina was saying, the situation and the circumstances these women are in lend themselves so well to the storytelling that makes this particular way that we're doing so powerful and realistic and in a post-Dobbs world, that much more pivotal and frightening. But I just was so struck by how real this felt. We get to see Sadie in real time deal with our current situation, state by state as they're traveling.\n\nObviously having Kimberlyn be the one to drive her was an important part of the story. Was that always going to be the point with Kimberlyn saying, I don't agree with your choice, but I'll help my friend?\n\nRM: I've had one point of view on this particular subject for a very long time. We read this article that was between a mother and a daughter; the daughter was pro-choice and her mother was not. The article was this touching, civilized discourse between these two women who weren't going to let this particular issue divide them. I was really struck by it, because I fully admit, I often let it divide me. And when I read that, I thought, well, that's really something and really beautiful. Kimberlyn is conservative. She absolutely would not make the choice to have an abortion, which I think is embedded in the term \"pro-choice.\" It was Sadie's choice and she sees the value in being her friend. We thought that was the way to show that politics and partisanship don't have to rip us apart and even an issue as divisive and personal as this, if you have love for each other and value each other, you can get through pretty much anything together. That's what the show is really about.\n\nSadie's been through a lot. Melissa, how did you emotionally tap into this storyline?\n\nMB: I really appreciated a conversation Rina and I while we were shooting this episode about the agony. Sadie's agony is not that \"I have to do this.\" It's the, \"How am I supposed to do it?\" So that was my way in emotionally. Sadie was not emotionally distraught by the fact that she had made this choice and she knew it was right for her and her body. She was very certain and had a lot of clarity in that regard. But it was the fact that the circumstances were so out of her control and the rage was more what she was feeling she couldn't easily find care for herself. It was kind of meta on set. We had Kyra Sedgwick directing this, who's also a massive activist for women's rights. All of us were just angry because I think in real time, as we were shooting this episode, laws were changing and things were going haywire. So it was easy to find that way in because all of us were living it in real time.\n\nRina, you produced \"Everwood\" when they had an abortion storyline. In it, Treat Williams' doctor stated, \"Whatever choice you make is right, as long as it's yours.\" How was the experience different now -- not only being 21 years later but also producing for The WB versus Max?\n\nRM: It was an incredibly different conversation. That storyline I remember so clearly because that was another where we ultimately had to flip the decision. Initially, Dr. Brown (Williams) was going to be the one performing the abortion. And the network said, \"Absolutely not. We will not let you do that.\" So we twisted our way around and we thought, wouldn't it be interesting if the person who fundamentally, from their own conservative place of religious upbringing, Dr. Abbott (Tom Amandes), doesn't believe in abortion, but feels like he has to do it for the health care of women to honor his father. So we're like, oh, this is an even better story, we've solved it. That was when we realized they didn't want us to solve it. They were like, \"You can write it, but we don't know if we're gonna shoot it.\" And Greg Berlanti, thank goodness, was like, \"We're gonna write it.\" And it was brilliant. Then they said, \"Well, you can shoot it, but we don't know if we're going to air it.\" Greg just kept saying, \"Fine, do what you want. We're making the episode.\" And I actually do think there were one or two affiliates that did not air the episode.\n\nSo I have to guess that this process was very different from that.\n\nRM: Well, it was incredibly powerful and it was so meaningful. I think because it was network, because \"Everwood\" was a very specific type of show, it did feel like -- I hate to use the term -- but a very special episode. We sort of treated it with kid gloves. We had to. We had to approach it from the agony of the decision-making itself. The show had a slightly more earnest bent to it. I like to say hopeful, because I feel like \"earnest\" somehow gets a bad rap. What we were so anxious to do here -- and we were just so lucky to have Max as our partner and they had no problem with it -- and the joy was to be able to write it as a normal story. This is what happens. It was not very special. There were a million other things happening in Sadie's life and as she was saying, the anger, the rage and the feelings were about the helplessness that she felt, but it wasn't about the decision. To me, beyond even just talking about abortion, it's normalizing women's bodies. It's demystifying women's bodies. Even the way this whole storyline starts is by Lola coming in saying, \"I need a tampon.\" I remember being Lola's age, you used to have to smuggle your tampons like it was heroin, and God forbid anyone saw you carrying a tampon around. You feel so ashamed. I love everything about this show saying, everything we do with our bodies is normal. It's our bodies. It's our healthcare, and it doesn't have to be this catastrophic, shame-driven unspeakable thing. It was a real shift. And by the time we were writing it, Roe was gone. So we knew you couldn't just do a simple walk-in to a clinic. The whole world has shifted since \"Everwood.\"\n\nAnother big difference here was having abortion pills, not having Sadie go into a clinic. Was that a discussion you had?\n\nRM: I'm a little older so when my friends were tragically in this situation, the medical abortion wasn't something that was around. That's slightly more recent. All of the writers in the room said, \"This is what she would naturally do. She wouldn't need to go in.\" So it does seem like that is the wave of the future for more women, to have access to these pills, which of course is now being taken away as well.\n\nMB: I think it's great that we were able to show the pill as an option, in a narrative way. Because I think historically, we've seen these stories told and it's these traumatic, horrific experiences most of the time in a clinic setting. So I thought it was really refreshing how pedestrian the procedure and what she goes through is. So that was something that I was really proud of that we were able to do.\n\nRM: I remember when \"Six Feet Under\" did it a long time ago. Then they took another route and decided to have the angel baby haunt them! (Laughs) That was later, but their initial take was great, because Lauren Ambrose just walked into a clinic. And back then that was shocking. We did talk about normalizing it as part of our health care and what it needs to be.\n\nHow do you think viewers will feel about the storyline or have reacted thus far to the series?\n\nRM: The internet is such a crazy place and people voice some really crazy things and some of the stuff that's been said about the show... I've been more upset when people call these women silly. There is nothing silly about them. You can not like the show, you can wish that we made \"All the President's Men\" and that's an excellent film that we didn't set out to do. But I find there's like an ingrained sexism in a lot of the ways that people react, so I'm sure people are gonna have feelings. I'm sure they're gonna be mad at the choice. I read one thing someone wrote about how Sadie's going to be really struggling with the choice because Loafers loves her and so why wouldn't they start a family?\n\nI mean, going off of that, did you discuss Sadie's decision to tell Malcolm (Brandon Scott) about the abortion?\n\nRM: That was big argument in the room, because the room was really split down the middle in terms of does she owe him the truth? And then it becomes more about, take this particular situation out of it. Who are these characters to each other outside of this situation? We were genuinely split. I noticed it was a lot of the younger people in the room said, \"She shouldn't tell him. It's not his business. It's sending the wrong message to tell him.\" I heard that argument but I also just felt Sadie's journey in this story is sort of coming to the realization of how much she cares for this person, how much she trusts and actually does love him. I'm like, if he was a one night stand, if this was an accident, I get it. I said, but this is someone she really cares about. For me, I didn't feel like Sadie would do that. I think her growth is trying to connect with people she actually cares about.\n\nMB: I agree with you. I think it I think it just serves even more as a normalizing of sorts. It's a part of her arc of becoming a more mature, honest person who holds herself accountable. I think telling him, the audience getting to see him be a pillar of support without questioning what she knows is right for herself when they're not married -- their relationship status is up in the air, at best -- and their situation is so such an outlier to what like what what we can say as normal, it's another opportunity that we took to normalize what a relationship can look like. [It shows] that timing is everything for a woman and the fact that we have the ability to make the choice. Relationships can survive this situation. So I thought it served us even more in that regard. We're just in the business of trying to normalize. And also, his reaction will define their relationship and either strengthen or crumble it. I think that he shows his true colors in the way that he reacts.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This article contains SPOILERS for The Girls on the Bus episode 8.\n\nSummary\n\nSadie and Grace's story about Walker's donor caused a drop in Walker's poll numbers in The Girls on the Bus episode 8. Lola discovered that Josie manipulated her Twitter account to help \"The Freshman\" candidate in The Girls on the Bus episode 8. Sadie and Kimberlyn's road trip proved how much the journalists cared for each other despite their differing beliefs and political views.\n\nAfter two episodes that took a slightly different approach to the story, The Girls on the Bus episode 8 was more reminiscent of earlier episodes through its balance between the presidential race and the journalists' personal lives. The Girls on the Bus characters still had personal issues to deal with, but the candidates returned to a much bigger role in episode 8. The new episode dealt with the fallout of the events of The Girls on the Bus episode 7 and its shocking cliffhanger ending as they traveled to the next stop on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Girls on the Bus takes inspiration from the true story of co-creator Amy Chozick's experience as a journalist on Hillary Clinton's bus during her 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns. Though the candidates and journalists are fictional, they all fit specific known archetypes in politics. This is emphasized through the use of nicknames for most candidates instead of their actual names. In The Girls on the Bus episode 8, some holes were poked in these stereotypes for both the candidates and the journalists.\n\nRelated The True Story Of Hunter S. Thompson & 1973's Boys On The Bus Max's The Girls on the Bus features Hunter S. Thompson, an American journalist whose work in the 1970s was recorded in the book The Boys on the Bus.\n\n9 Walker's Campaign Is Struggling\n\nSadie & Grace's Story Exposed Walker\n\nClose\n\nIn The Girls on the Bus episode 7, Sadie and Grace got the scoop they needed to expose one of Walker's biggest donors, Blaine Novak, as well as her connection to him and the foundation he was using to lure young women into performing sexual favors for him. They published the story at the end of the episode, but it wasn't until The Girls on the Bus episode 8 that viewers got to see the impact of it. It was revealed that on Super Tuesday, Walker, who had been the frontrunner at that point, didn't do well in the polls.\n\nWalker cut ties with Novak after the story broke, but she didn't return his large donations to her campaign, drawing further criticism. While everyone was focused on Novak, Sadie was chasing a different side of the story. Sadie was more interested in finding out who paid Declan Morales, the man behind the burner phone, to look into Walker's campaign and effectively ruin her chances at becoming the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n8 Kimberlyn Helped Sadie Get An Abortion\n\nKimberlyn Looked Past Her Views To Help Her Friend\n\nClose\n\nAt the end of The Girls on the Bus, Sadie's abortion pills didn't arrive in California in time before they left for their next stop on the campaign trail. Unfortunately, their next stop was in Missouri, where abortion is illegal. To get around this, Sadie's doctor sent her pills to Illinois, which was a four-hour drive away from where they were staying. With Sadie's driver's license expired, Kimberlyn offered to drive her to Illinois to help her get her pills.\n\nAs a conservative, Kimberlyn didn't believe in abortion but wanted to help her friend regardless of her political views. There haven't been many one-on-one scenes between Kimberlyn and Sadie in The Girls on the Bus, so it was nice to see them get to spend so much time together. Their trip was prolonged when they arrived in Illinois just as the post office was closing and had to spend the night for Sadie to pick them up in the morning.\n\n7 Sadie Confessed She Wanted Kids With Loafers One Day\n\nSadie Still Has Feelings For Loafers\n\nClose\n\nThough Sadie told Kimberlyn and Lola she was pregnant and getting an abortion, only Grace knew Loafers was the father in The Girls on the Bus. Neither Kimberlyn nor Lola were aware of their affair as they weren't around during the last presidential campaign when Sadie and Loafers first started hooking up. Kimberlyn didn't ask Sadie about his identity, but she did ask Sadie about their relationship when she turned down a call from the baby's father.\n\nSadie was honest with Kimberlyn, telling her that while they weren't together and had never really been together, she really liked him. Sadie said that she knew she wasn't ready for children at this point in her life, but that she wanted to have kids with him one day. With Sadie's commitment and emotional issues and the tension between them, it's very unlikely that Loafers knows Sadie feels this way about him in The Girls on the Bus.\n\n6 Grace Got In A Fight With Her Dad\n\nGrace's Dad Cared More About His Career Than Family\n\nClose\n\nGrace's father, Harold, who is also a famous journalist, was introduced in the first two episodes of The Girls on the Bus. Their scenes together showed that their relationship is a bit strained, with him not seeming to respect her as a journalist with a reputation independent of him. This became an issue again when he reappeared in The Girls on the Bus episode 8 during a news panel where he picked a fight with Grace about her story on Walker, undermining her work.\n\nAfter the taping, Harold claimed that it was just \"theater\" and he thought Grace was in on the joke but didn't really apologize for what he'd done. When the opportunity came for them to do a Vanity Fair interview and photo shoot together, he was all for it while Grace was hesitant. After a conversation with her husband Charlie, Grace agreed to do the piece but almost instantly regretted it. Their photo shoot was awkward to begin with, but things took a turn for the worse when Harold revealed he'd sent money to Annie without talking to Grace or Charlie.\n\nThe couple had cut Annie off financially when she suddenly dropped out of school and started traveling with her drug dealer boyfriend. Harold told Grace he thought they'd made the wrong decision, which is why he didn't talk to her about it. Eventually, Harold apologized, confessing he knew he was a bad father and that he was jealous of Grace for being able to be successful as a journalist and a parent. Harold was prepared to keep his distance from her and Annie, but Grace decided Annie needed her grandfather in her life.\n\n5 Josie Manipulated Lola\n\nJosie Took Advantage Of Her To Help Her Candidate\n\nClose\n\nEarly on in The Girls on the Bus episode 8, Lola realized that her Twitter/X account had been hacked and people were using it to post tweets attacking \"The Freshman\" candidate. Lola used her other social media to tell people she'd been hacked, but Josie came up with another plan to get the message out on a larger scale. Josie proposed that Lola interview \"The Freshman\" candidate to help people realize that she had no ill will towards her.\n\nWhen it came time for the interview, Josie had a list of pre-approved questions, which included Lola apologizing to \"The Freshman\" candidate. When Lola refused to follow the script, Josie cursed at her. Fortunately, Lola had contacted her old manager who had a connection with Twitter/X employees, and told her that Lola's account hadn't been hacked, but the password had been changed. Lola realized that Josie had changed her password and made the tweets to get an interview to help \"The Freshman\" candidate. Josie had been manipulating Lola all along in The Girls on the Bus, ending their relationship.\n\n4 Sadie Set Up A Meeting For Kimberlyn With Gayle King\n\nSadie Wanted To Help Kimberlyn Make Her Dream Come True\n\nClose\n\nSadie and Kimberlyn used their road trip to Illinois to get to know each other a bit better. In the past few episodes of The Girls on the Bus, Kimberlyn has expressed frustration with her job at Liberty Direct News. She confessed to Lola that she didn't want to work there anymore, but that she felt like she would never fit in wherever she went. When Sadie asked Kimberlyn what her dream job was, she said she didn't have one the way Sadie did with The Sentinel.\n\nInstead, Kimberlyn said when she was younger she wanted to be Gayle King. Sadie told Kimberlyn she should start her own media company as she had the money to do it, but Kimberlyn reminded her that it wasn't her money, it was her dad's and Eric's. To encourage Kimberlyn to follow her dreams, Sadie reached out to Gayle King, whom she had previously interviewed, and set up a meeting for them in Chicago. Whether Kimberlyn will leave Liberty Direct News remains to be seen in The Girls on the Bus, but Sadie's gesture shows how much she believes in her.\n\n3 Walker Fired Loafers\n\nSadie's Story Accidentally Led To Loafers Getting Fired\n\nClose\n\nIn The Girls on the Bus episode 8, Walker was scrambling and failing to regain support after Grace and Sadie's story dropped. She was set to have an event, but she canceled it under the guise of \"fundraising,\" which Sadie translated as going into hiding. Shortly after, a news story was dropped about Walker firing members of her campaign, something she'd already done in previous episodes. Unfortunately, this time her list of axed staff members included Loafers, who had escaped the cuts last time when Walker hired Benji.\n\nLoafers didn't appear in The Girls on the Bus episode 8, meaning he was likely fired before they even arrived in Missouri. That could also be what he was calling Sadie about when she was in the car with Kimberlyn. Walker firing Loafers means he's no longer on the campaign trail, but it also takes away the conflict of interest between him and Sadie, which could potentially lead to them rekindling their romance. However, Sadie also indirectly caused him to lose his job, and he could blame her for it.\n\n2 The Journalists Supported Sadie\n\nThe Journalists Kept Sadie Company After She Took The Abortion Pills\n\nClose\n\nJust after Sadie learned about Loafers getting fired in The Girls on the Bus episode 8, Kimberlyn, Lola, and Grace appeared at her hotel room door. They knew she was taking the abortion pills at that time and wanted to be there with her in case she needed company. While Sadie initially was going to tell them she wanted to be alone, she saw their excitement at a movie night sleepover and let them in.\n\nThe sweet scene in The Girls on the Bus episode 8 was a reminder of how far the characters had come from their first scene together, where they were bickering and making snide remarks about each other. Eight episodes into The Girls on the Bus season 1, their friendships have grown into ones borne out of proximity to genuine love, care, and respect for one another. The Girls on the Bus has foreshadowed that the last two episodes will test their bond, but they will stand together through it all.\n\n1 The Hot Guy Candidate's Nice Guy Persona Is Fake\n\nThe Hot Guy Candidate Fooled Everyone\n\nClose\n\nEarly on in The Girls on the Bus, the small-town mayor was dismissed as the \"The Hot White Guy\" candidate, someone who was nice to look at but didn't have enough experience or notoriety to earn the Democratic nomination. However, throughout The Girls on the Bus, \"The Hot Guy\" candidate has found himself in different positions that have bolstered his chances and established himself as a nice, good guy. With Walker trending down, \"The Hot Guy\" candidate could have a real chance.\n\nBeyond his work with the voters, he even formed relationships with the reporters and Sadie in particular, who started to see him as more of a friend than another candidate. The end of The Girls on the Bus episode 8 changed how viewers saw \"The Hot Guy\" candidate completely through a scene of him talking about how he had everyone \"eating out of [his] palms.\" In the final scene in The Girls on the Bus episode 8, \"The Hot Guy\" candidate emerged as a villain, and one who could win it all.\n\nEpisode #\n\nTitle\n\nRelease Date\n\n1\n\nPilot\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n2\n\nShe's With Her\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n3\n\nThe Audacity of Nope\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\n4\n\nTwo Americas\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\n5\n\nBinders Full of Men\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\n6\n\nThe Debate\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n7\n\nNothing to Fear But Fear Itself\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n8\n\nLife is a Highway\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n9\n\nSlouching Towards Brooklyn\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n10\n\nThe Everydays\n\nMay 9, 2024\n\nWhere To Watch The Girls On The Bus\n\nThe Girls on the Bus\n\nThe story centers on Sadie McCarthy (Melissa Benoist), a journalist who romanticizes a bygone era of campaign reporting and scraps her whole life for a shot at covering a presidential candidate for a paper of record. Sadie joins the bus and eventually bonds with three female competitors, Grace (Carla Gugino), Lola (Natasha Behnam), and Kimberlyn (Christina Elmore). Despite their differences, the women become a found family with a front-row seat to the greatest soap opera in town - the battle for the White House.\n\nCast Natasha Behnam , Adam Kaplan , Rose Jackson Smith , Hettienne Park , Peter Jacobson , Scott Cohen , Kiva Jump , Max Darwin Release Date March 14, 2024 Seasons 1 Where To Watch HBO Max", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kayla_laguerre_lewis@screenrant.com", "name": "Kayla Laguerre-Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girls_on_the_Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Girls on the Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hunter S.

It's Changed a Lot", "body": "[Editor's note: The following interview contains light spoilers for Episode 8 of \"The Girls on the Bus.\"]\n\nOn the April 25 episode of Max's \"The Girls on the Bus,\" Sadie (Melissa Benoist) had an abortion.\n\nThe matter-of-fact decision for the young reporter is only (\"only!\") complicated by the all-too-real problem of Sadie's political journo travel schedule, and the differing rules of which U.S. state she is in when and how to legally ship the needed pills to the correct location.\n\n\"It has to be specific, because I was like, 'They're not [campaigning in] a Democratic primary in a deep red state,'\" co-creator Amy Chozick, whose reporting memoir upon which the show is based, explained about the logistics. \"Then, of course, the rules were changing. We literally had a map of the U.S. in the writers room like, 'OK, they could be realistically campaigning in Missouri, and it is still legal in Illinois,' so we were actually moving pieces of the campaign and the bus around. It's interesting. [Reporters] really are giving up [their] entire lives to the job, and that includes your personal health.\"\n\n\"We also just realized times have changed in the last 20 years,\" showrunner Rina Mimoun added. \"What does it mean [to have] a medical abortion versus having to go into a clinic and have the procedure done?\"\n\nOn the show, Sadie, foiled by getting pills in the mail before she must depart for a new state, must travel from campaign reporting in Missouri to get to a P.O. box in Illinois where her doctor can legally ship the medication. An added twist finds the conservative Kimberlyn (Christina Elmore) as the one who has a valid driver's license and can therefore get Sadie to Illinois -- adding a nice message about helping out friends in crisis, regardless of one's beliefs.\n\nFor Mimoun, what stood out about the story arc was the lack of network notes -- a far cry from when she was writing similar plotlines in the early 2000s.\n\n\"For me, the most important thing about the subject matter is to continue to normalize it,\" Mimoun said. \"When I first started [in] television, over 20 years ago, it was always a very special episode. And one of the first times I got the opportunity to write about [abortion] was on 'Everwood' in 2002. It was a battle every step of the way. I watched Greg Berlanti fight for it every step of the way, to the point where the network was saying, 'Look, we may not air it.' And Greg said, 'OK, we're still gonna shoot it, you don't have to air it, we're gonna shoot it.'\"\n\nAt first, the \"Everwood\" abortion plot was going to include the lead of the show (it ultimately wound up going to a guest star played by Kate Mara). \"The studio said, 'You cannot do it with the lead of the show, you have to find a different way to tell the story. We won't let you do that to the lead,'\" Mimoun recalled. \"Like there was a tarnishing of it, which I remember feeling really upset about. But that note made the story actually better in a weird way, because we were so angry. And we found a more interesting way to tell the story.\"\n\nNo such studio notes happened this time around. (Funnily enough, \"Everwood\" and \"The Girls on the Bus\" share a studio.) \"Nothing but positive,\" Mimoun confirmed.\n\n\"The Girls on the Bus\" certainly isn't the first TV show to show a straightforward decision without a lot of hand-wringing or guilt. (This reporter, for instance, will always be grateful for how the storyline was handled on a 2016 \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" episode, another show aimed primarily at young women.) But at a time when the right to an abortion is under a fresh wave of attacks in the U.S., making it a plotline at all -- while focusing on its run-of-the-mill-ness -- remains a quietly revolutionary act.\n\nAnd now, with the serious stuff taken care of, Chozick and Mimoun can enjoy the added bonuses their lead actress' superhero past brings to the table.\n\n\"Melissa, being Supergirl, did that stunt when she jumps over the counter and punches the shit out of the guy [who wouldn't give her the pills],\" Chozick recalled about a fun fantasy sequence in the episode. \"She [said], 'I'm ready, I got it.' And the whole crew was like, \"Oh, my god, girl just lunged over the counter!'\"", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_strecker@indiewire.com", "name": "Erin Strecker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girls_on_the_Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Girls on the Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rina_Mimoun", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rina Mimoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Chozick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amy Chozick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everwood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Benoist", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Benoist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Elmore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christina Elmore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_special_episode", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Very special episode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Berlanti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Berlanti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Story arc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergirl_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supergirl (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Mara", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Mara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Ex-Girlfriend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/melissa-benoist.jpg?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513709", "eventUri": "eng-9513709", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 114, "textEnd": 122}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

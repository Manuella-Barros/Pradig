This was her sixth straight-set win in seven matches at the tournament. You would never know it from the final score, but there was a brief moment when it looked like \u015awi\u0105tek might be tested. Paolini won two straight games, including a break in the third game, to take a 2-1 lead in the first set. \u015awi\u0105tek responded by winning 11 straight games. Paolini was able to salvage the sixth game in the second set to avoid being shutout, but there is no slowing down the 23-year-old. Fans were more than happy to celebrate \u015awi\u0105tek's historic three-peat after one of the most impressive tournament runs of all-time. Naomi Osaka was the only player who truly challenged \u015awi\u0105tek in this tournament. Their second-round match went to three sets, with \u015awi\u0105tek needing a tiebreak to win the first set. She held on for a 7-5 victory in the third set to advance. \u015awi\u0105tek lost 17 games in the match with Osaka. She lost a total of 20 games combined in her six other matches, including a double bagel against Anastasia Potapova in the fourth round that took just 40 minutes to complete. The win moved \u015awi\u0105tek into a tie with Justine Henin for the third-most French Open women's singles titles in the Open Era. Chris Evert (seven) and Steffi Graf (six) are the only players ahead of her. \u015awi\u0105tek is a perfect 5-0 in Grand Slam finals, with the 2022 U.S. Open being her only non-French Open title to date. Her next opportunity to add to that record will come at Wimbledon starting on July 1. Last year was \u015awi\u0105tek's best showing at the All England Club when she reached the quarterfinals before losing to Elina Svitolina in three sets.", "summary": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek remains an unstoppable force at the French Open after claiming her third straight title and fourth in the past five seasons with a 6-2, 6-1\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10124037-iga-swiateks-historic-french-open-3-peat-celebrated-by-fans-after-win-vs-paolini", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1717857223/juhd1nh8kcvhus3hkdre.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:55:44", "author": "Adam Wells", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.035}

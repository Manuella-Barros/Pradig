{"id": 232005868, "title": "With EVs, Honda may be North America's most committed automaker, for the moment", "text": "It's difficult for automakers to make quick pivots because of the complex supply chains that feed into the entire automotive ecosystem. For Honda, being fully EV by 2040 is in line with other automaker transitions, which Newman described as \"fairly fast\" for all. \"That is a long time for you and me, but for an automaker, that is the planning they have to do because of the scope of the industry and the globalization of the industry,\" she said. Honda's plan to get to 100% zero emissions by 2040 relies on more than just EVs, too, with fuel cells in the mix as well. In a separate shift away from traditional auto technology, Honda and GM began to jointly produce hydrogen fuel cells as a diesel alternative this year. Honda has also ben ramping its hiring and construction at an Ohio plant formed by a $3.5 billion joint venture with LG Energy Solution in 2022, which will provide batteries for Honda and Acura EVs. Honda could have a brand advantage Honda has a trusted name with consumers to capitalize on at a time of doubts about EVs, among both consumers and carmakers. A survey this year conducted by Edmunds asked customers which brands they trust to make the best EV. Tesla finished first at 23%, followed by BMW at 13%, Toyota at 12%, and Honda at 8%. Ford rounded out the top 5. Hyundai and Kia have done much more in the EV space but didn't make it into the top five, noted Jessica Caldwell, Head of Insights at Edmunds. Toyota and Honda, meanwhile, made the cut among consumers even though they produce just one fully EV model (BMW produces five). \"This sets Honda up well,\" she said. In April, Honda was the second fastest-selling mass-market car brand on Cars.com. The market downturn, coupled with government incentives, are bringing EV prices into striking distance of traditional cars, but consumer sentiment over EVs still seems to have soured, or at least stalled. A Gallup poll of Americans in April found ownership of EVs increasing by 3% annually, but an equal percentage decline in consumers who indicated serious interest in buying an EV, down from 12% to 9%. Overall, 35% of Americans said they might consider buying an EV in the future, down from 43% last year. Roadblocks will remain, even for EV manufacturers like Honda that score high in surveys, and not only the tangible issues of affordability, improving battery life, range, and charging station availability. Another big hurdle is political. \"There is a portion of the public that has decided that EVs are just not for them,\" Caldwell said. \"They have made their mind up, they don't support it. It is almost like a political standpoint, so it doesn't matter how good the vehicles are.\" Edmunds surveys show a partisan divide, with Republicans less inclined than Democrats to buy an EV or support the transition more broadly. \"Automakers have to overcome this,\" Caldwell said. For Honda, brand is an advantage it would not want to wait too long to attempt to capitalize on in EVs. In the least, \"they need to get into the conversation,\" Newman said.", "summary": "Honda is ramping up EV investments as GM, Ford and others scale back, but it's as much about playing catch-up as being opportunistic in the auto market.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/09/honda-may-be-americas-most-committed-ev-automaker-for-the-moment.html", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107425502-1717717916944-gettyimages-1814050628-jl3_6365_c952fd8b-d2e1-40de-96a8-2d4c0f2c1446.jpeg?v=1717761204", "video": "https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2024/M05D22/7000341002/1716399651-34638537360-hd_L.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:29:03", "author": "Kevin Williams", "authors": ["Kevin Williams"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.256}

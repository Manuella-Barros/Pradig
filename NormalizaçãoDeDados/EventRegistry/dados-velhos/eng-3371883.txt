Being installed on millions of Android devices worldwide has made these apps attractive targets for cybercriminals, who have significantly extended the functionality of mobile banking malware.\n\nThe new version of Faketoken performs live tracking of apps and, when the user runs a specified app, overlays this with its phishing window to steal the bank card details of the victim. The Trojan has an identical interface, with the same color schemes and logos, which creates an instant and completely invisible overlay. Based on the results of Kaspersky Lab?s research, the criminals are targeting the most popular international taxi and ride-sharing services with this malware.\n\nMoreover, the Trojan steals all incoming SMS messages by redirecting them to its command and control servers, allowing criminals to get access to one-time verification passwords sent by a bank, or other messages sent by taxi and ride-sharing services. Among other things, this Faketoken modification can also monitor users? calls, record them, and transmit the data to the command and control servers.\n\nOverlaying is a common function enabled in many mobile applications. Last year, Kaspersky Lab reported a modification of Faketokenthat was attacking more than 2,000 financial apps around the world by disguising itself as various programs and games, often imitating Adobe Flash Player. Since then, Faketoken has been developed further, and has expanded the geography of its activities.\n\n?The fact that cybercriminals have expanded their activities from financial applications to other areas, including taxi and ride-sharing services, means that the developers of these services may want to start paying more attention to the protection of their users. The banking industry is already familiar with fraud schemes and tricks, and its previous response involved the implementation of security technologies in apps that significantly reduced the risk of theft of critical financial data. Perhaps now it is time for other services that are working with financial data to follow suit.\n\nThe new version of Faketoken targets mostly Russian users. However, the geography of attacks could easily be extended in the future. We have seen that with previous versions of Faketoken and other banking malware in the past,? said Viktor Chebyshev, security expert at Kaspersky Lab.\n\nResearchers have also detected Faketoken attacks on other popular mobile applications, such as travel and hotel booking apps, apps for traffic fine payments, Android Pay and the Google Play Market.\n\n?Android?s security problems emerge on a regular basis, despite Google?s many attempts to bring its security to the appropriate level. Developers push new and more secure versions forward, but actual adoption of those secure versions lags behind heavily,? added Altaf Halde, Managing Director- South Asia, Kaspersky Lab\n\nTo protect yourself against the Faketoken Trojan and otherAndroid malware threats, Kaspersky Lab strongly recommends that users do not install apps from unknown sources and use a reliable security solution, such as Kaspersky Mobile Antivirus: Web Security and Applock, on their device.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 302, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "wgt": 100, "id": 303, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "wgt": 100, "id": 342, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303236", "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303499", "label": {"eng": "Short Message Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303561", "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303588", "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304228", "label": {"eng": "Geography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304781", "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305643", "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306750", "label": {"eng": "Google Play Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308364", "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311949", "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "312212", "label": {"eng": "Computer crime"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "313490"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314747", "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "336765", "label": {"eng": "Mobile banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_network_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "344591", "label": {"eng": "Transportation network company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "358705", "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "358724", "label": {"eng": "Adobe Flash Player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1276292", "label": {"eng": "Android Pay"}}]}

\"Faketoken\" targets mostly Russian users but they believe the geography of attacks could easily be extended in the future.\n\nThe \"Faketoken\" modification steals all incoming SMS messages by redirecting them to its command and control servers, allowing criminals to get access to one-time verification passwords sent by a bank, or other messages sent by taxi and ride-sharing services.\n\nAmong other things, the malware also monitor users' calls, records them and transmits the data to the command and control servers.\n\nKaspersky researchers have also detected 'Faketoken' attacks on other popular mobile applications, such as travel and hotel booking apps, apps for traffic fine payments, Android Pay and the Google Play Market.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories":

Kaspersky Lab researchers say the malware, which has been known for over a year now, has been upgraded to include some more nefarious mechanisms to steal users' payment card data from taxi and ride-hailing apps.\n\n\"The authors of its newer modifications continue to upgrade the malware, while its geographical spread is growing,\" malware researcher Victor Chebyshev wrote in a blog post on Thursday (17 August). Last year, Kaspersky reported that a modification of Faketoken was attacking over 2000 financial apps across the globe.\n\n\"Not so long ago, thanks to our colleagues from a large Russian bank, we detected a new Trojan sample, Faketoken.q, which contained a number of curious features.\"\n\nThe latest version of the trojan targets apps used to book taxi services in Russia along with mobile apps used to pay traffic tickets issued by the country's Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety.\n\nResearchers have said that they haven't been able to reconstruct the exact chain of steps used by the malware's creators to target and attack users yet. However, they suspect that the malware makes its way into users' smartphones via bulk SMS messages that include a prompt to download pictures.\n\nAfter the Trojan is initiated, it hides in an unsuspecting shortcut icon on a user's smartphone and begins to monitor all calls and apps launched by the victim.\n\n\"Upon receiving a call from (or making a call to) a certain phone number, the malware begins to record the conversation and sends it to evildoers shortly after the conversation ends,\" Kaspersky Lab said. \"The authors of Faketoken.q kept the overlay features and simplified them considerably. So, the Trojan is capable of overlaying several banking and miscellaneous applications, such as Android Pay, Google Play Store, and apps for paying traffic tickets and booking flights, hotel rooms, and taxis.\"\n\nAfter the victim launches a particular app, it substitutes its user interface with a fake one that asks the person to plug in his or her bank details.\n\n\"The substitution happens instantaneously, and the colors of the fake UI correspond to those of the original launched app,\" researchers warned. \"As millions of Android users have these applications installed, the damage caused by Faketoken can be significant.\"\n\nWhile many banks often send over a unique code to a customer in order to process a payment, the fraudsters behind Faketoken can circumvent this safety feature by stealing any incoming SMS messages and relaying them over to the command-and-control servers.\n\nAccording to researchers, the latest version of Faketoken does seem to be unfinished since its screen overlays still contain \"formatting artifacts\" that can pose as red flags for a user.\n\n\"As screen overlays are a documented feature widely used in a large number of apps (window managers, messengers, etc.), protecting yourself against such fake overlays is quite complicated, a fact that is exploited by evildoers,\" researchers said.\n\nSo far, Kaspersky has not detected a large number of attacks using the Faketoken sample, nothing that it could be one of its test versions. Given the list of targeted applications so far, the Russian language in the malware's code and Russian UI of the overlays, the trojan is currently focusing on users in Russia and CIS countries.\n\n\"The fact that cybercriminals have expanded their activities from financial applications to other areas, including taxi and ride-sharing services, means that the developers of these services may want to start paying more attention to the protection of their users,\" Chebyshev told IBTimes UK. \"The banking industry is already familiar with fraud schemes and tricks...

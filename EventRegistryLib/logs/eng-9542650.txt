That is, until he spots Ryan Reaves and Max Domi across the room, sitting in their stalls, and is reminded of an ongoing debate.\n\nFormula One drivers were athletes, Marner shouted.\n\n\"You are the only two that don't think so!\" Marner said.\n\nMoments like that, of joy and happiness, felt rarer than ever for Marner this past season -- his eighth as a Leaf.\n\nMore than ever, playing at home in Toronto, for the team he grew up cheering for, looked like it was a slog for Marner. More stressful than enjoyable. More taxing than it should be. Like the accumulation of so many scars and noise had finally beaten him down.\n\n\"Sometimes, stuff just doesn't go your way,\" Marner said, explaining his poor start to the season. \"And then you start doubting yourself, questioning what's going on and how you're playing and stuff like that. And eventually, it gets more into the mental stage. That's where you just gotta stay patient and realize stuff will turn around.\"\n\nThe Leafs have been waiting for things to turn around for Marner in a meaningful way when it matters most. To mature into the leader -- on the ice and off -- they believe he can be.\n\nAt some point, they believed, it would happen.\n\nThat Marner would stop listening to the voices around him whispering in his ear, that he would finally ignore the relentless noise in the city.\n\nThat he would once again perform like the star he was in the postseason.\n\nThe Leafs saw him do it in 2018, when, at 20, he impressed a veteran Boston Bruins team with 9 points in a seven-game first-round loss. Or even earlier than that, not long after they drafted him in 2015, when he piled up 14 points in four games for the London Knights at the 2016 Memorial Cup, winning the tournament MVP.\n\nWhat they were waiting for never came. Not yet anyway.\n\nAnd now, after another early playoff exit in which Marner struggled again to make a superstar-calibre impact, the Leafs are at an apparent crossroads where they must ask themselves more seriously than before if it will ever happen -- in Toronto anyway.\n\nMarner turned 27 on Sunday. He's suited up in 633 games as a Leaf. The time to decide whether he should be a long-term part of the core is now, with Marner eligible to sign an extension on July 1.\n\nAn extension is one of three possible paths the Leafs can take him with him this offseason. The others: decide (or be forced) to let him play out the final year of his contract, ahead of unrestricted free agency next summer, or trade him first.\n\nAn extension doesn't feel the least bit tenable, not after what went down for the team and Marner in the playoffs, and not with a price tag that's bound to exceed the $10.9 million cap hit on his last contract.\n\nHad Marner led the Leafs on a deep playoff run, maybe even one that ended with a Stanley Cup, a deal like that, like the one William Nylander signed in January (eight years, $92 million) might have been acceptable, even desirable.\n\nIt's hard to see it now.\n\nThe Leafs could let Marner play out the final year of his six-year contract, as they did initially with Nylander. Maybe team president Brendan Shanahan, if he indeed sticks around, convinces new MLSE president Keith Pelley that he and the team deserve one more shot after playing chunks of the 2023 playoffs without Nylander and Auston Matthews.\n\nThe organization could conceivably see how the 2024 playoffs play out before they decide to commit to Marner.\n\nThey might also have no choice in the matter: Marner could simply decide he's unwilling to waive his no-movement clause, and that could be that. Marner could walk himself to UFA status next summer.\n\nThe other possibility? A trade.\n\nWhat kind of trade is the question. Where would Marner even accept a trade to, if he accepts a trade at all? And what would the Leafs look to fetch in return?\n\nShanahan, for one, isn't a huge fan of the kind of trades that see a star player shipped out for a bunch of assets. Quantity over quality. Which makes it more likely, perhaps (?), that the Leafs seek at least one sure thing in a Marner trade.\n\nIdeally for the Leafs, that player is a) around the same age as Marner, to fit with the timeline of Matthews (who turns 27 in September) and Nylander (28); b) under contract (or controllable as a future RFA); and c) a difference maker of some kind.\n\nThe Leafs could also attempt to pull off the kind of multifaceted trade GM Brad Treliving once made in Calgary, one that turned Dougie Hamilton into Noah Hanifin and Elias Lindholm. But those are hard to pull off.\n\nThis won't be an easy trade to make regardless of the structure, not with Marner and his agent, Darren Ferris, playing a role in the process and not with a potentially limited pool of teams (teams that Marner wants to go to and teams that want to trade for and extend Marner) involved.\n\nThe Leafs would have had much more flexibility to execute a Marner trade last summer before the no-trade clause in his contract (which still had two seasons left on it) kicked in. They might have even done it had then-GM Kyle Dubas stuck around.\n\nThe timing for such a trade felt right then. It still feels right today, if only because this whole core experiment hasn't worked and Marner has felt more and more like the likeliest odd man out.\n\nThere have been hints of growth from Marner over the years, but this season, more than others, was riddled with the kind of moments that drove home why playing at home might not be right for him, not anymore.\n\nAfter the Leafs lost for the fourth straight time in Edmonton in mid-January, Marner said he thought the team had played a \"great game again.\"\n\n\"All these games we've been playing, we've played some really good hockey,\" he said.\n\nMarner believed things would turn around, \"Because we're a great hockey team. And we gotta ignore what everyone else says. We know we're a great hockey team. We show it every night.\"\n\nNo, frustration hadn't seeped in, Marner went on, \"but I think a lot of people on the outside are trying to do that. It's how it goes.\"\n\nMarner's comments caused a stir back home. The Leafs had lost four in a row but were playing ... \"great\"? The reaction made its way to Marner. A brief media blackout ensued in the days that followed.\n\n\"I've been in those moments as well, and it's not fun,\" he said of Samsonov's struggles. \"Everyone's against you, really. And everyone is coming at you at all different angles and thinking you're not good enough.\"\n\nWas that how he felt about playing in Toronto? And if so, why? And what could the team do about it, to make him feel less under siege?\n\nCriticism seems to touch Marner in a way it doesn't with Matthews or Nylander.\n\nHours before the Leafs played in Chicago in late November, Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said what was plainly obvious at the time, that Marner wasn't \"executing at the level that you'd expect from Mitch,\" and hadn't \"found his groove here yet.\"\n\nKeefe walked back those comments immediately after the game, as he did when Marner bristled the previous fall when Keefe called out the team's \"elite players\" after a loss to Arizona.\n\nMarner smashed his stick in frustration when he was benched for a shift that same month in Anaheim and chucked his gloves to the ground in frustration during an argument with Nylander on the bench this spring against the Bruins.\n\nThe apparent roots of his feelings of beleaguerment: the contract dispute in 2019 that led to his missing the first day of Leafs training camp in Newfoundland as he and his agent sought a contract in line with the five-year deal that Matthews had signed earlier in the year.\n\nMarner eventually won a six-year contract from the Leafs, with a $10.9 million cap hit that suddenly placed him among the highest-paid players in the league.\n\nScrutiny and criticism of Marner immediately intensified. He was still only 22, still just a kid, but expectations had skyrocketed -- and he seemed to feel it. Then came a 2020 postseason, after a pandemic-disrupted regular season, in which Marner failed to score and produced only four assists in a disconcerting five-game loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\nMarner didn't score again as the Leafs unraveled against Montreal in a seven-game series loss in 2021.\n\nPlaying with apparent freedom and joy in that 2018 series against Boston, Marner's postseason play had morphed into something stiffer and stilted. He simply didn't produce enough when the Leafs needed him most. And for the Leafs, top-heavy as they come, that was essential.\n\nLike in the 2022 playoffs, when he registered only two assists in the final four games (three of them losses) of a seven-game loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning. Or the following spring when he hit the scoreboard only once, with an assist, in three consecutive second-round losses to begin the second round against Florida.\n\nThe Leafs needed an electric Marner early in this most recent series against Boston, with Nylander mysteriously absent for Games 1-3. And while Marner was placed in a difficult defensive role, matching up with David Pastrnak, with few offensive zone faceoffs and little time spent with Matthews, he managed only 2 points as his team went down in the series 3-1.\n\n\"Everybody has their moments,\" Keefe said ahead of Game 7. \"Mitch will have his as well.\"\n\nHe never did. And now, the clock may have finally run out on his time with the Leafs.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Change is all but certain this offseason. The Leafs' top-heavy roster is constructed to get production from those players with the largest salaries. And when that production didn't emerge in the postseason, it only reinforced the need for change.\n\nBut Marner doesn't want change.\n\nInstead, during his end-of-season availability, Marner was clear: He wants to stay in Toronto long-term.\n\n\"That would be the goal. I've expressed my love for this place, this city. Obviously I grew up here. I'll start thinking about (a contract extension) now and try to figure something out,\" Marner said.\n\nWith another early Leafs postseason exit, Marner's future has been pushed into the microscope.\n\nMarner was once again front and centre in the middle of a handful of cameras and nearly two dozen media members on Monday. Throughout this season, even though Marner suggested otherwise on Monday, it's felt less and less like he enjoys the spotlight of being a hometown boy playing in Toronto.\n\n\"It means the world,\" Marner said of being a Leaf. \"Obviously we're looked upon as kind of gods here, to be honest. That's something you really appreciate. The love that you get from this fanbase is unlike any other.\"\n\nYet the flip side to that \"love\" is the very public criticism that comes with a lack of playoff success. Marner is coming off a postseason that, at least by the standards he has set as a premium point producer in the regular season, was disappointing. He was a defensive stalwart, which he deserves credit for, but still had just one goal and three points in the Leafs seven-game first-round loss to the Boston Bruins.\n\nAnother early playoff exit means the Leafs core as assembled might have played their last game together as Leafs.\n\nAuston Matthews and William Nylander have long-term extensions kicking in this summer. John Tavares has just one year left on his deal and, at 33, might not hold the kind of trade value that would justify approaching the Leafs captain about waiving his no-movement clause.\n\nMarner's age (27), star status and the heat he has continually drawn in a loud market might end up justifying that conversation between his camp and Leafs management, however. He also holds a full NMC.\n\nAnd so for now, his future - whether in Toronto or elsewhere - will remain arguably the most hotly-debated topic surrounding the Leafs in a summer full of anticipation and ambiguity.\n\nMarner has now played in eight postseasons and has won one playoff round. Yet in that time, Marner leads all Leafs with 50 points in 57 playoff games.\n\n\"Regardless (of whether) it's this year or last year, it's all the same s -- - pain, to be honest. It's never fun going home this early. It never gets easier,\" Marner said.\n\nOn Monday, there was no shortage of long-time teammates who came to Marner's defence.\n\n\"He's an incredible human being, friend. Love the guy. Look, there's always someone taking heat here regardless of how it's going. But we love him,\" Morgan Rielly said.\n\n\"In my time here I've learned that there's always a scapegoat, there's always a narrative, there's always something. But we love (Marner),\" Matthews said.\n\nMarner spoke for under three minutes, with his availability ended by a Leafs staff member. The crowd around him might have been even larger had Tyler Bertuzzi's availability not taken place simultaneously across the Leafs dressing room.\n\nHe's no stranger to crowds. Marner is one of the most in-demand players on this Leafs team, at least when it comes to requests to speak from local media. He is the product of the Greater Toronto Area and wears an \"A\" on his jersey.\n\nThe spotlight is there for the taking for Marner. But this season, in particular, he's looked and sounded more defiant than ever in front of the cameras.\n\nMarner did see the positives in the attention athletes in Toronto receive as he reflected on the adoration he saw the Raptors fanbase show when they won the NBA championship in 2019.\n\n\"That's the kind of love you want,\" Marner said.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that's love he's going to get.\n\nMaybe Leafs management decides, against popular desire, to keep the band together and bring back the same core next season. The chance for the team's core to come back once again is a notion Marner believes in.\n\n\"Because we're great players,\" he said when asked about why that core deserves to stay together in 2024-25. \"We know it's not an easy thing to do to win the Stanley Cup. We know that. Everyone knows it.\"\n\nAs what could be his last appearance as a Leaf wound down, Marner's tone grew more quiet and ostensibly more reflective.\n\n\"It sucks,\" Marner said of exiting the playoffs. \"It's never going to get easier. It's a challenging thing. Challenges build adversity. We've been through a lot of that and it's only going to make us better.\"\n\nEverything Marner said publicly didn't just suggest, but reinforced his desire to remain in Toronto.\n\nIf that happens, he believes he knows how the core he's still a part of can get over the hump and go deep into the postseason. Marner said success and improvement next season will come from the team \"trusting ourselves.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of trust and belief in that and that's something that will remain strong,\" Marner said.\n\nEven if that's the case, the aforementioned \"If\" will still linger long after Marner walked out of the circle of reporters and out of the public eye.

We're looked upon as kind of Gods,\" Mitch Marner said, via Mike Zeisberger of NHL.com.\n\nOver the years, Marner has been a target of criticism from Maple Leafs fans as the team has failed to achieve its goals in the playoffs. These comments will undoubtedly catch the attention of angry fans. In this year's playoffs, Marner put up three points, one of them being a goal in the series against the Bruins, according to NHL.com. This came after another productive regular season, in which Marner put up 26 goals and 59 assists for 85 points in 69 games played, marking the sixth year in a row in which he eclipsed the point-per-game threshold. There is no doubt about his ability to produce in the regular season.\n\nIn the playoffs, Marner has played 57 games in his career, scoring 11 goals and recording 39 assists for 50 points, which is not necessarily bad, but it has not been enough for Toronto over the years. The only year in which Marner and the Maple Leafs have advanced past the first round was in 2023, when they beat the Tampa Bay Lightning, but lost to the Florida Panthers in the second round.\n\nAfter this year's loss to the Bruins in Game 7, which is a familiar feeling, the Maple Leafs have some questions to answer this offseason, including what to do with Marner.\n\nWill the Maple Leafs extend Mitch Marner this offseason?\n\nThe 2024-2025 season will be the last for Marner on his current six-year contract which pays him $10.903 million a year, according to CapFriendly. The dilemma for the Maple Leafs last year was that Marner was set to have a no movement clause kick in, and they eventually decided to keep him. Marner still has that no movement clause now heading into his final season with the deal, according to CapFriendly.\n\nThe options for the Maple Leafs likely are to either extend Marner to keep him around long-term, or letting him play on the last year of his contract if they decide that he should not be a part of the team's future.\n\nThe toughest part of this all is that while Marner has his faults, he is still a very productive player, so it is hard to let him walk without knowing that you will get someone who can step in and produce to a similar level. The Maple Leafs' actions this summer will be telling when it comes to the long-term view of Marner's role with the team.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mitch-Marner-makes-confusing-admission-on-Toronto-future-after-Bruins-heartbreak.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542650", "eventUri": "eng-9542650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

There was talk of the Maple Leafs making changes before Game 5 of their series with the Bruins. Now that the series is over, the talk will get louder, and the focus will be on Mitch Marner.\n\nThe blow is not softened because William Nylander and Auston Matthews missed games due to injury. All the attention will be on the Maple Leafs' effort, especially in Games 3 and 4. Considering what head coach Sheldon Keefe got from his team in Games 5-7, you have to wonder where that attention to detail was in those two games.\n\nNHL Rumors: Changes Will Be Coming In Toronto, and Five Trade Destinations for Mitch Marner\n\nHowever, when the core of this group has been together dating back to 2016 and has only won one playoff series in eight years, questions have to be asked about whether it is time to change the core. Those questions date back to the bubble when the Maple Leafs lost to Columbus in the play-in round.\n\nThe pieces around the core have changed, but the results have been the same. Depth players are necessary to win a Stanley Cup, but star players must show up and win the series. Mitch Marner did not show up for the Maple Leafs.\n\nMarner had three points in seven games, not to mention only 12 shots on goal in the series. That is not good enough for a player eligible to sign an extension on July 1st. Marner has a current salary cap hit of $10.903 million. To have just three points in seven games is unacceptable.\n\nWe saw Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery call out his $11 million player, David Pastrnak, and he delivered. Though Pastrnak only had five points (three goals and two assists) in seven games, he stepped up when it mattered when goals were challenging.\n\nNHL Rumors: If the Toronto Maple Leafs Lose ...\n\nThis was Marner's lowest point total in the playoffs. Now, he has 50 points in 57 playoff games, but it feels like he is afraid of the big moment. While he was defensively sound, being on the ice for the game-winning series-clinching goal and just watching the puck was a problem.\n\nMarner has been the target of criticism in the past, and rightfully so. Star players need to perform in the playoffs. William Nylander does that. He is not afraid of the big moment. It feels like Marner. And that is a place the Maple Leafs need to start.\n\nGeneral Manager Brad Treliving has decisions to make, especially with Sheldon Keefe. Keefe is mostly likely gone, but stranger things have happened. But Treliving has to go to Marner and find out where he wants to play. Marner puts too much pressure on himself when he plays in Toronto during playoff time.\n\nAs Pierre LeBrun of TSN noted, Marner has control of where he plays as he has a no-movement clause and it will not be easy to facilitate these trades.\n\nHowever, we saw the Tampa Bay Lightning figure out how to remove Ryan McDonagh, who had a no-movement clause, so nothing is impossible. But Treliving has to ask where he wants to go. Maybe he does the same with Tavares, but they might just let that play out.\n\nAre We Sure Major Changes Are Coming with the Toronto Maple Leafs?\n\nToronto can't be afraid to let a player walk to free agency, especially if there is no trade partner. But the worst thing they can do is run this back again and sign Marner to a long-term extension at a higher AAV.\n\nThe time is now to make a change and start with Mitch Marner.", "source": {"uri": "s22929.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "s22929.pcdn.co"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_biringer@s22929.pcdn.co", "name": "Jim Biringer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Treliving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Treliving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McDonagh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McDonagh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s22929.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23107050_168395535_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542650", "eventUri": "eng-9542650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1497, "textEnd": 1505}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Marner said his desire is to stay in Toronto long-term. Considering he's got a current contract that expires at the end of next season and there is talk about offseason changes, those comments are intriguing, to say the least.\n\nWhen asked about a long-term extension, Marner responded, \"That'd be a goal. I've expressed my love for this place, this city. Obviously, I've grown up here. We'll start thinking about that now and trying to figure something out.\" He added that he loves the passion of the fan base, how the players in Toronto are beloved, and that he's known nothing else.\n\nThere are two ways fans may take this. One, despite having a rough playoff series and there being a ton of consternation about the forward, Marner isn't bailing on the Maple Leafs. He's taking a lot of heat, but it sounds like he's not focused on the negative. His only desire is to stay in Toronto and find a way to help the team.\n\nRelated: NHL Rumors: Jets, Maple Leafs, Golden Knights\n\nSecond, if the Maple Leafs want to move on from Marner and seek a trade because they're thinking a change to the \"core four\" is necessary, he's not interested in making that easy.\n\nIf the Maple Leafs are going to successfully move Marner, they need him to cooperate and be part of the process. He holds all of the leverage in a deal and without his blessing, the Leafs won't be able to trade the player. To some, a no-move clause is little more than a player having a right to pick his destination. Well, what happens if the only place the player wants to play is in a city that wants to make changes?\n\nSome argue the Leafs could simply tell Marner they have no intention to sign him, thus putting pressure on him to accept a trade. The gamble there is that he'll play out the season and then walk as a pending UFA. Others will argue that him doing so would be too much pressure on a player in a market like Toronto, but there's no telling what someone is willing to put up with if they're out to prove a point.\n\nPerhaps the Maple Leafs aren't looking to move on. If that's the case, both sides can potentially get what they want and the Leafs can leverage a better AAV with a player who has no desire to leave. Perhaps a lower salary takes some pressure off Marner, pressure that might not be there if he were to play in a smaller market.\n\nThere are several ways this whole situation gets ugly. First, the Leafs may tell him their intention is to move on. If so, Marner will be heartbroken and could feel scorned, making things as difficult for the Leafs as possible. Second, the Leafs may tell him they're open to keep him if he's willing to take a team-friendly deal. If that happens, these negotiations could drag out all summer and most of next season. Finally, the Maple Leafs' fan base and media may be ready to say goodbye and the interactions between the player and the fans he loves will go south. None of these things are a positive and many of these scenarios could hang over the team as they try to improve their fortunes and move in a more positive direction.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_parsons@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Jim Parsons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFA_GmbH", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UFA GmbH"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Mitch-Marner-Maple-Leafs-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542650", "eventUri": "eng-9542650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

In today's, however, I decided to take on a player that embraces the media and doesn't mind being the center of attention a bit more often, in Mitch Marner.\n\nRelated: 7 Cool Things About Leon Draisaitl\n\nThough the 27-year-old has been criticized due to some underwhelming playoff performances, there is no denying he is one of the NHL's most talented players. On top of that, he also has a fun-loving personality which makes him an easy guy to route for. With that being said, here are 7 cool things about the Toronto Maple Leafs star winger.\n\nMom Missed His First NHL Goal\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2016, Marner's parents were in attendance watching their son and his Maple Leafs teammates take on the Boston Bruins. During the first period of that game, Marner broke into the zone and fired a shot past Anton Khudobin for his NHL goal. Soon after, the camera panned to his parents in the crowd, only there was one problem. While his dad, Paul, was sitting there, his mom Bonnie was nowhere to be seen.\n\nAs it turns out, Bonnie had gone to the bathroom and missed the goal entirely. She told Sportsnet that she heard the entire arena celebrating, and was told shortly after that it was her son who had scored. Thankfully, she has gotten to witness plenty of goals from him since.\n\nHockey Crazed Parents\n\nFrom a very young age, it was clear that Marner had both the talent and drive you need to try and become a professional hockey player. In fact, he has said that he was just four years old when he started to believe he had a chance to reaching the NHL. A big part of that reason may be due to how intense his parents, particularly Paul, treated their son's hockey.\n\nA video on Youtube featuring hockey parents, which includes Paul, has gotten plenty of attention in recent years. In the video, his dad is shown getting very worked up at Marner, who was just 11 years old at the time. Many are divided on how they feel about the video, with some believing his dad instilled a great compete level in him, while others believe he was being far too hard on his child.\n\nGrew Up a Leafs Fan\n\nIf you weren't already aware, Marner has been a huge hockey fan for nearly his entire life. Growing up in Markham, which is a city located just 30 minutes from downtown Toronto, it was an easy choice for him to become a Leafs fan.\n\nBack in 2016, a feature aired on how Marner had always hoped to play for his hometown team at some point in his career. One can only imagine what a thrill it must have been for him to be taken fourth overall by them back at the 2015 draft.\n\nMemorial Cup Champion\n\nAfter being drafted, the Maple Leafs chose to send Marner back to the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in what would be his final season of junior hockey. He was incredible all season long, registering 39 goals and 116 points in 57 regular season games. He was able to improve on those totals even more in the playoffs, scoring 16 goals and 44 points in just 18 games.\n\nHis play helped lead the Knights to an OHL championship and sent them off to compete in the 2016 Memorial Cup. Playing on a dominating line with both Matthew Tkachuk and Christian Dvorak, Marner and the Knights went on to win the Memorial Cup. To no surprise, Marner was voted as the tournament's MVP after putting up 14 points in just four games.\n\nOffered Scholarship From the University of Michigan\n\nAround the same time he was selected 19th overall by the Knights in the OHL draft, Marner received a scholarship offer from the University of Michigan. It was a tough decision for him to make at the time, UofM has produced some elite talent over the years, and boast several alumni players now in the NHL such as Kyle Connor, Zack Werenki, Max Pacioretty and many more.\n\nUltimately, Marner chose the OHL path, and it has clearly paid off for him. He ended up playing three seasons with the Knights, two of which he cracked the 100-point barrier in.\n\nCo-Owner of Esports Company\n\nEsports is something that, especially in recent years, has really started evolving. Professional gamers are now being paid, oftentimes handsomely, and you'd struggle to find many kids who aren't playing video games. Marner is admittedly a big fan of gaming, which is why during the summer of 2020 he joined the ownership group of an esports company called OverActive Media.\n\nThe ownership group of OverActive media includes more than 80 people, and despite Marner's fame, he isn't the most known person involved. Abel Tesfaye, known by his stage name The Weeknd, is also involved in the company.\n\nStarted a Business in High School\n\nDuring his time playing junior hockey in London, putting up offence at a ridiculous pace wasn't all Marner was doing. As it turns out, himself, Dvorak, and another teammate in Owen MacDonald created a business together called The MOD Feast.\n\nMarner said that The MOD Feast served \"bagels and stuff,\" and had Pizza Day every Friday. The three often had regular customers and had their orders memorized off by heart. While he has since moved on to focus on his NHL career, perhaps his entrepreneurial side will come out once again once his career is all said and done.\n\nPlenty More Stories to Come\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning of the article, Marner is more of an outgoing personality than some other superstar players in the NHL. Because of this, fans are able to get a bit more of a look into the type of person he is compared to some of the other elite talents in the league. As the years go on, we will likely learn even more about him, which could perhaps result in this article being updated years down the road.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colton_pankiw@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Colton Pankiw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Khudobin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anton Khudobin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Crosby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sidney Crosby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Esports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_ice_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Junior ice hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markham,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Markham, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Markham, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Connor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Dvorak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Dvorak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Ross_Robertson_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

I've expressed my love for this place. Obviously, I've grown up here so we'll start thinking about that now and try to figure something out,\" Marner told reporters at the team's end-of-season availability.\n\n\"It means the world (to be a Maple Leaf), we're looked upon as, you know, kind of gods here to be honest. It's something that you really appreciate and the love that you get here from this fanbase and this tension is kind of not unlike any other. You saw it with the Raptors a couple of years ago, the love that they still have for a lot of those players that they had to trade off this year. And that's kind of the love you want.\"\n\nMarner will be eligible to sign a contract this off-season as he enters the final year of a deal that carries a $10.9 million cap hit.\n\nThe 27-year-old scored 26 goals and 85 points in 69 games this past season but struggled in the post-season registering just three points in seven games in the first round against the Boston Bruins.\n\nWhile the salary cap is projected to increase, there is concern as to whether the Leafs can fit a sizeable contract extension for Marner with Auston Matthews and William Nylander having their new deals kick in starting next season.\n\nMarner has a no-movement clause in his contract so the Leafs will have to navigate that when they consider Marner's future.\n\n\"Yes, he has control over the situation with his no-move clause but I think there's a couple of questions here. No. 1: How does he feel? Has he gotten to a point where he thinks long term it's just better for him to be somewhere else?\" Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman said on the latest edition of the 32 Thoughts: The Podcast. \"Now, because of where we are in the calendar of his contract, that becomes white-hot under a microscope. To me, the No. 1 question is, what does he think? Does any part of him think that it's time?\n\n\"You have to always be careful with this because we're 24 to 48 hours after the emotion of a tough defeat but I do think it's possible that he will think about it. It doesn't mean that he comes right out and tells the Leafs to get me out of here but at least there will be a Marner collective -- the people around him -- conversation about maybe is it better to go somewhere else. Now, I don't know if he's going to say that publicly, it's probably not in his best interest to say that publicly. But I do think on some level, especially the people who represent him, you're not doing your job if you don't at least say, Mitch, would this be better for you?\"\n\nWhile Marner is expected to hold most of the cards with the no-move clause in his contract, Friedman believes there are avenues the Leafs can explore.\n\n\"No. 2 part of that equation is the organization. Do they think it's time? Because yes, while Marner has the power of the no-move clause, the Maple Leafs' power is to say, Look, we're not offering you what you want... but we're thinking it's better if we just use the cap room,\" Friedman said. \"And they can say if you don't want to play ball with us that's fine, we can play it out next year and that means you're not going to get your extension here and you're not going to get the eighth year.\"", "source": {"uri": "toronto.citynews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityNews Toronto"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_talbot@toronto.citynews.ca", "name": "Michael Talbot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_leaf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maple leaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://toronto.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/10/2023/01/11/mitch-marner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542650", "eventUri": "eng-9542650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

This time, it happened in Game 7 at the hands of the Boston Bruins, who beat the Leafs 2-1 in overtime on May 4.\n\nThe consensus belief among NHL insiders, including The Athletic's Pierre LeBrun, is that Toronto will endure changes this summer, most probably by firing head coach Sheldon Keefe but potentially by trading one of their four core forwards.\n\nThat said, the presence of no-move clauses (NMC) in the contracts of all superstar Leafs might make things difficult. If both sides, Toronto and Marner, can agree to a mutual part of ways, the forward might find it interesting to land with the rebuilding Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nThat is what Bleacher Report's Joe Yerdon suggested in a column published on May 5, where he listed the Blackhawks as a potential landing spot for Marner.\n\nAs Yerdon sees the situation, Chicago's \"moving prospects and/or a future first-round pick that should be pretty high\" could \"get the Leafs' ears perked up.\"\n\nThe Leafs are considered one of the best teams, at least on paper, on the forward front. They boast an impressive unit featuring Auston Matthews, John Tavares, Mitch Marner, and William Nylander.\n\nWith a payroll north of $97 million through the 2024 playoffs more than $40 million devoted to those four players alone, according to PuckPedia, and another first-round exit, something has to give.\n\nMarner will become an unrestricted free agent in July 2025 after the next season is over. He's in possession of a full NMC, however, which means he can block any trade Toronto agrees to and enter UFA next year whether the Leafs want it or not.\n\n\"The stars are aligned for the Leafs to shake things up and move on from Marner,\" Yerdon wrote in his article. \"The 26-year-old has a full no-move clause, and with unrestricted free agency awaiting him, it's a less-than-ideal situation for the Leafs.\"\n\nAs Yerdon notes, Marner's $10.9 million yearly salary, paired with his deal becoming an expiring one come puck drop next fall, could make for a tough sell in a trade.\n\nMarner, however, is coming off a regular season in which he scored 85 points (26 goals, 59 assists) in 69 games to go with 3 points in 7 first-round postseason contests.\n\nThat full Marner package, considering both his contract and his production, could be solid enough to lure the Blackhawks.\n\n\"Chicago has oodles of cap space, and taking on Marner's $10.9 million hit wouldn't be a problem,\" Yerdon explained when building his case. \"Asking him to play with Bedard and maybe Celebrini might be an easy sell for him to waive his no-move clause.\"\n\nYerdon is referencing Blackhawks rookie Connor Bedard, who is nearly a lock to win the Calder Trophy award given to the rookie of the year in the NHL, and also the consensus-best prospect for the upcoming draft, Boston University forward Macklin Celebrini.\n\nThe Blackhawks already count the former as one of their own, but in order to get Celebrini they will need to win the draft lottery scheduled to take place on Tuesday, May 7.\n\nChicago has the second-largest odds for landing the No. 1 pick (13.5%) only trailing the San Jose Sharks (25.5%). Whoever wins the lottery is guaranteed to pick Celebrini coming out of college.\n\n\"[Marner's] all-around abilities to score points and defend well would go over huge in the Windy City,\" Yerdon added in his proposal, teasing an unstoppable trio comprised of Marner, Bedard, and Celibrini if all goes according to plan.\n\nWith their forward lines already set and under contract for many years at top-dollar value, the Leafs have a much more pressing need to bolster their defensive corps. That's what Yerdon thinks and what he believes Toronto will try to get in return for Marner.\n\n\"Toronto, ideally, would land a No. 1 defenseman in any trade for Marner,\" Yerdon wrote.\n\nThat said, Yerdon doesn't believe Chicago would be able to trade No. 1 defenseman Seth Jones to the Leafs, noting that the blueliner also has a no-move clause he'd need to waive to facilitate a trade.\n\n\"Moving Marner and taking on Seth Jones (who also has a no-move clause) and his $9.5 million cap hit through 2029-2030 is probably not going to work,\" Yerdon wrote, adding that trading Jones away is \"not a hope that's going to be fulfilled by Chicago.\"\n\nPerhaps Toronto is happy with landing a few younger prospects from Chicago's farm system and a few draft picks, but with the Leafs sitting right in the middle of their window of contention it's hard to find that too appealing for them if they want to shuffle their roster ahead of next season.", "source": {"uri":

It seemed this year could be different; it felt different. They had so many different names, a different style, and a different vibe. Unfortunately, in all the \"different,\" it turned out to be the same as previous years.\n\nWith all the disappointment in the last several years, it seems that this is the final year that the full Maple Leafs' core will be returning. While the same thing was thought of last season, this time the team has a new general manager (GM) and potentially some major changes coming to the front office and coaching staff. It seems like the core has to be the next domino to fall.\n\nMaple Leafs' GM Brad Treliving won't be moving his star, Auston Matthews, or potentially the best playoff performer on the team, William Nylander. While it is going to be hard to move any of them, they will need to get creative and find out who is wanted on the open market. That essentially takes John Tavares out of the equation, largely due to his contract. That leaves Mitch Marner and Morgan Rielly as the two players who could be moved to shake up the culture of this team.\n\nIf the Maple Leafs are serious about moving a piece of their core, Marner makes the most sense hands down. Firstly, he is entering the last season of his current contract. Rather than re-signing him to a larger deal that carries a higher average annual value (AAV) and puts the organization in a harder spot cap-wise, it would be better for the club to look for potential trade partners that fit Marner's requests and attempt to move on from him. Now, the hardest part of making this all work is the fact that he carries a full no-movement clause, which gives the team little to no leverage when it comes to a trade. However, it has been done before, and it'll be done again.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that Marner is now going to be the scapegoat for all things Maple Leafs playoff elimination. Rightfully so though, he wasn't very good. At times, he looked nervous and scared to initiate contact in the corners. It all came to a head when he appeared to give up on his check, David Pastrnak, which led to the Game 7 overtime (OT) winner. This had Maple Leafs' fans taking to social media, saying that play was his last in a Maple Leafs jersey.\n\nThis is where things could get interesting for Treliving and the Maple Leafs. If he does approach Marner and his agent about a potential trade, he will likely ask him to submit a list of teams that he may be interested in joining. Marner could easily turn down the offer and express his want and willingness to return to the team next season. But after all the scrutiny that he has faced over the last few seasons and his growing annoyance with the media, he may be willing to move.\n\nRelated: 7 Cool Things About Mitch Marner\n\nThe trade that would be made would be equivalent to 75 cents on the dollar. This means that if the Maple Leafs do trade Marner, fans shouldn't expect to get back equal to or more than what he brings to the team. But they could bring a player or two that helps the forward group and/or a forward and a top-four defenceman. Regardless, the potential of him not being back with the team at the start of training camp is more likely than it has been in years past, and the reasons behind it make more sense than ever.\n\nRielly is the other viable option to be dealt by the Maple Leafs this offseason. The longest-tenured player on the team could find himself playing for another team next season to give them more cap space and a new look to help bring a Stanley Cup to Toronto. Similar to Marner, though, Rielly carries a full no-movement clause until July 2028, when he will need to submit a 10-team no-trade list. However, for the time being, he essentially has full control over what happens in the future. He is in the second season of his eight-year deal that he signed back in 2021, which carries an AAV of $7.5 million per season. This AAV isn't impossible to move, especially since he is still a very good player. The only challenge is the fact that he has the final say in what happens.\n\nAgain, like Marner, Treliving would need to approach Rielly and his representative for a short list of teams that he may be interested in playing for. If he agrees to the possibility of being moved, he will supply a list. However, if he waives his no-movement clause, he would be fully willing to agree to a trade and look for a fresh start.\n\nThese types of players would likely only want to be traded to another contender, which would limit the teams that would be able to make the move work based on cap space. For the Maple Leafs, it would be tough to trade Rielly; he is deemed the heart and soul of the group, but sometimes a team needs to make tough choices to give the team the best chance to succeed.\n\nRelated: Maple Leafs' Bad Injury Luck to Blame for Early Playoff Exit\n\nTrading Rielly would likely mean that the Maple Leafs could target a few pieces, such as another defenceman, or a higher-end top-six forward, but not nearly as much as they would get for trading Marner; these players they would get in return would probably be a one-for-one trade that would just change the culture and provide the team with a bit more cap space to help the roster elsewhere.\n\nOverall, it would be incredibly hard to move either of these players, but if the Maple Leafs want to change the look of their team, they will need to figure out a way to move one of the core five players. Only time will tell what happens, but Treliving will be one of the most watched GMs this offseason, tasked with the challenge of changing his team to help them win the Stanley Cup.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_lazary@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Spencer Lazary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rielly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rielly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Treliving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Treliving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Rielly-Marner-CP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542650", "eventUri": "eng-9542650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

We know that. Everyone knows that. It's the hardest trophy to win for a reason. It's seven games and it's an all-out war out there every single game.\n\n\"It's never going to get easier. It's always a challenging thing. Challenges obviously build adversity. We've been through a lot of that and it's only going to make us better.\"\n\nHere are some other highlights from the exit interviews:\n\nRelated: Trade Marner? Fire the Coach? Here are Some Moves That The Maple Leafs Can Actually Make This Summer\n\nMitch Marner\n\nThe 27-year-old, who has another year remaining on a XX-year, XX contract, can sign an extension on July 1. Whether that happens is not yet clear.\n\nBut Marner, who scored a goal and three points in seven games, wants to remain in Toronto.\n\n\"That'd be a goal. I've expressed my love for this place, this city. Obviously I've grown up here,\" he said. \"We'll start thinking about that now and trying to figure something out ... It means the world to me.\n\nMatthews, missed the final period in Game 4 and all of Games 5 and 6, revealed that he suffered an illness early on, but was purposely mysterious about what else might have been affecting him.\n\n\"I got really, really sick after Game 2,\" said Matthews, who had a goal and four points in five games. \"I was still kind of trying to recover going into Game 4, I took a weird hit and couldn't go any longer. That's about as detailed as I'll go into it. Obviously, it was really tough. Really frustrating to watch.\"\n\nWhen asked about the speculation that Marner could be traded, Matthews said, \"there's always going to be a scapegoat.\"\n\n\"We love Mitchy,\" he added. \"He's a great teammate, a great friend and a great competitor. In the end, we're all human beings and you take on a lot as players -- rightfully so. When you see someone go through something like that, it's hard on everybody.\"\n\nJohn Tavares\n\nThe captain of the Leafs came to the defense of head coach Sheldon Keefe, who many suspect will be replaced in the off-season.\n\n\"I think he's been great,\" said Tavares. \"I think that the team year-in and year-out, you see improvements and the consistency that the team has shown throughout his time here ... he's done a really good job.\"\n\nMorgan Rielly\n\nAs the longest-serving member of the Maple Leafs, this first-round exit seemed to hit Rielly the hardest. Perhaps it's because he senses that a significant change is finally coming.\n\n\"This group won't ever be exactly the same,\" said Rielly, who has played 11 seasons in Toronto. \"That's just the reality. As players, we're all aware of this. That's just the business.\"\n\nWilliam Nylander\n\nDespite missing the first three games of the playoffs, because of migraines, no player had a better playoffs than Nylander. He had three goals in Games 6 and 7.\n\n\"We battled to get back into the series,\" he said. \"Not happy with the result. But what we have in here is great.\"\n\nWhen asked about Marner, Nylander called his teammate \"an incredible human being\" and \"a friend.\"\n\n\"Love the guy,\" he added. \"There's always somebody getting heat in here, regardless of what it is. That's just the way it is.\"\n\nIlya Samsonov\n\nThe pending unrestricted free agent said he has watched the overtime goal that David Pastrnak scored \"20 times -- maybe more\" but added that he believes he \"made the right decision.\"\n\nAs for his contract status, Samsonov hopes to remain in Toronto.\n\n\"You guys know my answer.

From the looks of things, he'd be interested in signing an extension as soon as July.\n\n\"That'd be a goal,\" the Markham, Ontario native said of signing long-term. \"I've expressed my love for this place, this city.

In what was a tight series turned into a Game 7 thriller that saw David Pastrnak score the series winner in overtime. As the offseason begins for Toronto, is it time to see the Core Four split up? According to Elliotte Freidman it is, and could Mitch Marner be the odd man out?\n\nThe New York Islanders' only realistic path to acquiring one of the core four players would be through Marner since Auston Matthews and William Nylander are both beginning their contract extensions next season, and John Tavares is obviously not going to return to Long Island. If Marner were to be traded, it would also need to be to a team he desires since he has a full no-trade clause. Nobody knows what he is thinking right now, but the reality is he likely has other teams ranked above the Islanders in preference.\n\nRelated: Every NHL Team's Most Underrated Prospect\n\nIf Marner were to waive his no-trade clause, the Islanders would also need to find a way to get him to fit under the salary cap. Assuming no other major moves are made, they would need to shed close to $12 million to bring in Marner's $10,903,000 salary. While this is possible, it is going to be hard to pull off.\n\nClearing this cap space would begin with Jean-Gabriel Pageau. A lot of teams will have interest, but the difficulty will begin with his $5 million salary. One team that could be a fit is the Seattle Kraken. In this hypothetical, the Islanders will be trading Pageau, prospect Isaiah George, and a 2025 third-round selection for Kailer Yamamoto. From there, Yamamoto will be signing a one-year contract at $1.25 million. From there, the Islanders will need to shed Anders Lee's $7 million salary. This could be done by shipping Lee, alongside the 50th overall pick and other smaller assets to the Chicago Blackhawks for future considerations.\n\nFrom here, the Islanders will have close to $15 million in salary, enough to add Marner and a cheap replacement for Pageau. The difficulty begins with acquiring Marner. In this hypothetical, Marner would have a lot of leverage in deciding where to go. However, Toronto would not move him for scraps, so it would need to be a pretty enticing offer.\n\nThe Islanders' best asset is their 18th overall pick, but that is not of much use to Toronto. However, they could flip the draft selection in another trade to acquire a player of value. Toronto will need more than the draft choice, likely preferring a roster player over future assets. This will be difficult for the Islanders since that player would likely be a defenseman, either Adam Pelech or Ryan Pulock, both of whom have no-trade clauses. Given the Islanders' better defense on the right side than the left, Pulock would be involved in the trade.\n\nThe draft selection and Pulock should be the bulk of the package and Toronto could hash out the rest of the deal, whether it be a prospect like Calle Odelius or Matthew Maggio, another draft selection in the future season, or another roster player like Simon Holmstrom or Oliver Wahlstrom. From here, the Islanders would need to fill Pulock's void, likely targeting free-agent defensemen such as Matt Roy or Dylan DeMelo. To fill Lee and Pageau's spots, they could target Matt Duchene and Jack Roslovic.\n\nThe main message from all of this should be a trade is not realistic. Acquiring Marner would require a few other deals that are all unrealistic, and Toronto is likely to receive better offers than what the Islanders could cough up if they did decide to shop Marner. As well, he would likely prefer to play for a team with a better chance of winning a Stanley Cup than the Islanders.\n\nIf the Islanders are looking to add another elite player, the more realistic part of the Marner discussion may be shedding cap space by trading Pageau and even Lee. If the Islanders can manipulate the salary cap in a way to shed close to $10 million, they could target top free agents such as Sam Reinhart, Jake Guentzel, or Steven Stamkos. However, considering their biggest free agent signing in recent seasons was Semyon Varlamov in 2019, bringing in one of these top stars is not very realistic.\n\nThis issue may be a result of other teams preferring to play in different locations or on better teams, but the Islanders could try to enhance their odds of landing one of Reinhart or Guentzel by trading for their signing rights to gain the ability to offer an eight-year term on their next contract. For now, the Islanders can only watch the playoffs unfold for Reinhart and Guentzel, but they too are names to keep an eye on.\n\nThe biggest takeaway from all of this is how it is just a dream for Islanders fans to land Marner. It is a fun idea and could work by an armchair general manager, but it is just completely unrealistic. Considering Marner has just one season left on his contract, any trade would be similar to that of the Jonathan Huberdeau to the Calgary Flames deal rather than the proposed deal stated above. However, you never know what is going on in the head of a general manager, so anything is possible heading into the offseason.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He hopes that future in Toronto is long term.\n\n\"That would be a goal,\" Marner said. \"I've expressed my love for this place, this city. Obviously, I've grown up here. We'll start thinking about that now and try to figure something out.\"\n\nThe forward can become an unrestricted free agent July 1 and had 85 points (26 goals, 59 assists) in 69 games this season, but a goal and two assists in a seven-game loss to the Boston Bruins in the Eastern Conference First Round. The Maple Leafs have won one round in the Stanley Cup Playoffs (2023) since Marner joined the NHL in 2016-17 and it sounded like he realizes change could be coming.\n\n\"[Being a Maple Leaf] means the world,\" Marner said. \"Obviously we're looked upon [highly] here, to be honest, and something that you really appreciate. The love that you get here from this fan base and this attention is none like any other. You saw with the (NBA's Toronto) Raptors a couple years ago, the love [fans] still have for a lot of those players (who helped them win a championship in 2019) that they had to trade off this year. That's the love you want.\"\n\nSince Game 5 of the 2023 first round against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Maple Leafs have scored more than two goals only once in 14 playoff games, Game 2 of the opening round this season. The power play went 1-for-21 against the Bruins.\n\n\"It [stinks],\" Marner said. \"Regardless, from this year to last year, it's all the same pain. It's never fun going home this early. It never gets easier.\"\n\nMarner's production, like that of his teammates, dropped off in the playoffs, leading to criticism amongst many in the fan base.\n\n\"I think he is an amazing human and a great hockey player,\" Maple Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly said, \"so any heat or anything like that I believe would be undeserved.\"\n\nRielly, 30, is the Maple Leafs' longest tenured player who just concluded his 11th season. He said of all the early exits since 2017, this one has hit him hardest. He was on the ice when Bruins forward David Pastrnak cut past him in the slot and scored to win Game 7.\n\n\"Partly because of Game 7 overtime, partly being on the ice for the goal, partly age,\" Rielly said. \"I think every year gets more challenging.\n\n\"At this point, we are in a wonderful position where anything other than a championship is a disappointment. We are lucky to be in that position, but it makes anything other than that very difficult and very challenging for the group on many levels.\"\n\nCenter Auston Matthews, who led the NHL with 69 goals in 81 games and the Maple with 107 points, had a goal and three assists in the best-of-7 first round. He did not play the third period of Game 4 and missed Games 5 and 6 before returning for Game 7.\n\n\"I got really, really sick after Game 2,\" Matthews said. \"Played in Game 3, just kind of going through that still trying to recover going into Game 4. Took a weird hit and couldn't go any longer, but that's as detailed as I'm going to get into it. It was tough, really frustrating. It [stinks] and was killing me to watch.\"\n\nGoalie Ilya Samsonov, who can be a UFA, expressed a desire to return, but after two consecutive one-year contracts, said he is looking for some degree of term, or as he put it, \"stability.\" Pending UFA forwards Tyler Bertuzzi and Max Domi are also open to coming back, but the players understand that the Maple Leafs will never be the same.\n\nChange is coming. The question is to what degree?

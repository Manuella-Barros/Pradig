{"id": 223701270, "title": "PM Modi waived off Rs 16 trillion debt of 22 millionaires, neglected farmers: Rahul Gandhi", "text": "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has only worked for the benefit of 22 millionaires, \"waiving off their Rs 16 trillion debt over the past ten years\", while neglecting farmers' debts. He also criticised the media for allegedly not addressing farmers' issues and instead showcasing (Anant) Ambani's wedding. He accused the BJP government of destroying small businesses through demonetisation and faulty implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Campaigning for the Congress's Shimla candidate Vinod Sultanpuri at Nahan in Himachal Pradesh's Sirmaur district, Rahul urged voters to support all four Congress candidates in the state. Voting will be held on June 1 in all four Lok Sabha seats \u2014 Mandi, Shimla (reserved for Scheduled Castes), Hamirpur, and Kangra \u2014 and the six Assembly seats going to bypolls \u2014 Dharamshala, Kutlehar, Badsar, Gagret, Lahaul-Spiti, and Sujanpur. Rahul said he and his sister, Priyanka Gandhi, are foot soldiers of the people who would amplify their voices in Delhi. He accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of not assisting when a natural disaster struck Himachal Pradesh, affecting 22,000 families, and alleged that the central government was yet to provide several crores of rupees in disaster relief. Continuing his attack against PM Modi for alleged favouritism towards businessman Gautam Adani, Rahul said apple growers in Himachal are not getting their dues because of this \"partnership.\" Priyanka Gandhi had also talked about the plight of apple growers in the state after the Adani Group released the procurement price. Rahul alleged that all apple storage facilities have been given to one person (Adani), who controls the prices and stated that the prime minister is working for the benefit of 20-25 individuals. He also accused PM Modi of giving Adani control over seven airports and the arms manufacturing industry. \"As long as Modi is in power, Adani's company will continue to profit\", he added. Rahul promised that Congress would aim to create millions of millionaires. \"If Congress comes to power, each poor woman will receive 100,000 rupees annually in her account. Farmers will be guaranteed a minimum support price by law. Additionally, the Congress promises to provide 3 million government jobs and increase Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) wages to 400 rupees per day,\" he said. \"Graduates will be assured their first job in government companies and institutions. Along with waiving farmers' debts, the income of Anganwadi and ASHA workers will be doubled. He emphasised that these are not free gifts but rights that will be granted if Congress forms the government,\" he added. Rahul said the Constitution is the voice of India, which the BJP is attacking. He mentioned that Congress workers will fight against the BJP\u2019s attacks. He also noted that the Constitution is not just an ordinary book but represents ancient wisdom and the nation's voice. Senior Congress leaders Rajeev Shukla, Himachal Pradesh Congress President Pratibha Singh, Sultanpuri Minister Harshvardhan Chauhan, and MLA Ajay Solanki, among others, attended the poll rally. Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu accused the BJP of attempting to purchase votes. He stated that after a long struggle for independence, the Congress granted people the right to vote, but now the BJP is seeking to exchange votes for money. He urged people to teach the BJP a lesson on June 1 for this betrayal of public sentiment. Sukhu emphasised that only the people can overcome the influence of money and that this election will determine the future direction of politics. He presented the election as a contest between honesty and dishonesty, truth and falsehood, and righteousness and unrighteousness, asserting that in the end, truth and honesty will triumph. He accused the BJP of attempting to seize power by buying MLAs when they couldn\u2019t win votes, purchasing six legislators in a political marketplace. Referring to Rahul Gandhi as his leader, Sukhu mentioned that the Congress government has adhered to Gandhi\u2019s directives. He highlighted that Rahul Gandhi's 4,500 km Bharat Jodo Yatra aimed at national unity and integrity. Sukhu cited the implementation of the old pension scheme (OPS) for 1.36 lakh employees, the pension scheme for women providing 18,000 rupees annually, free education for widows' children up to 27 years, and full support for orphans as examples of the Congress government's achievements. He asked the voters to ensure a massive victory for Congress candidate Vinod Sultanpuri from Shimla and predicted that the Congress would secure all four Lok Sabha seats in the state and all six assembly seats.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/pm-modi-waived-off-16-trillion-dollar-debt-of-22-millionaires-rahul-gandhi-9353204/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/farmer-debt.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:13:49", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.133}

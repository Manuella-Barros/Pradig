Basically you saw that movie for a week in Chicago, New York and LA, London, and that was that. Then you had the streaming, which I thought was really sad. It's a really well-shot movie. So it concerns me.

But they figured it would be more cost-effective -- i.e., they would make more money -- if they didn't have to bother with spending money on promoting it and putting in theaters, and sharing that money with theaters, frankly. That's what it comes down to. To me, it's greed.\n\n\"...They certainly could have had a run at awards and prestige for themselves. I agree -- I think it's short-sighted. For a guy with such a storied career like Ron Howard, who has made so much money for studios, who was so deservedly well-recognized as a filmmaker historically -- to do that to a guy like him I think is appalling. He's a very nice guy, so he hasn't gone out there complaining about it, but I'm happy to do it for him. I'm not speaking for him, I'm just speaking for myself.

According to the actor, that deal was not honored by Amazon.\n\n\"They were going to put it out worldwide in many, many, many thousands of theaters,\" Mortensen told Vanity Fair. \"Then Amazon bought MGM, initially promised to respect the deal that MGM had made with Ron Howard, and then they went back on that. Basically you saw that movie for a week in Chicago, New York and L.A., London, and that was that. Then you had the streaming, which I thought was really sad.

Nicolas Winding Refn blamed Prime Video for not promoting his 2019 series \"Too Old to Die Young\" due to its subject matter.\n\n\"They took all my marketing money away because they were afraid that the show would reflect badly on Amazon. They told me that directly,\" Refn said to Vulture. \"They were so shocked by it. I was like, 'What's so shocking?' They said, 'It's going to make us look bad.' And I said, 'But I don't think anyone's going to look at you at all.' Certain parts of Hollywood are so self-absorbed that they think they're at the center of the universe. The rule of fear is very dangerous. Amazon released the show, but they said, 'We will bury you.' And so they did. However, you can't bury a diamond.\"\n\nAnd \"Road House\" director Doug Liman announced that he was boycotting the premiere of the reboot due its lack of a theatrical run.

However, much to Mortensen's frustration, it ended up only being shown in a handful of select theatres before finding its way onto Amazon's Prime Video service.\n\nSpeaking with Vanity Fair, Mortensen explained that the limited cinema release came down to Amazon's purchase of MGM, one of the production companies behind the movie. The actor said that Amazon had \"promised to respect the deal that MGM had made with Ron Howard.\"\n\nHowever, he said they \"went back on that\" agreement. Mortensen added, \"Basically, you saw that movie for a week in Chicago, New York and LA, London, and that was that. Then you had the streaming, which I thought was really sad. It's a really well-shot movie.\"\n\nMortensen felt that direct-to-streaming approach that Amazon took with Thirteen Lives was a waste of the hard work that he had done with Howard, which was also \"the first time I'd worked on a huge-budget movie in a long time.\"\n\nAt the core of Amazon's decision, in the eyes of Mortensen, despite any \"excuses\" they might want to make, is pure \"greed.\" The actor asked, \"How much money do you need?

It also featured performances from Colin Farrell and Joel Edgerton.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, the actor said the film was a \"really good movie\" that MGM had intended to \"put out worldwide in many, many, many thousands of theatres\" after it \"got the highest scores in the history of that studio\" in its test screenings.\n\nHe added: \"Then Amazon bought MGM, initially promised to respect the deal that MGM had made with [director] Ron Howard, and then they went back on that. Basically you saw that movie for a week in Chicago, New York and LA, London, and that was that.\n\n\"Then you had the streaming, which I thought was really sad. It's a really well-shot movie.\"\n\nHe continued: \"They have all their excuses for why they did that, but it comes down to greed. How much money do you need? I think Amazon could certainly have respected the deal, as they said they were going to, and released it widely in theatres and let it have its run. And then they could have also made money streaming.\n\n\"But they figured it would be more cost-effective - i.e., they would make more money - if they didn't have to bother with spending money on promoting it and putting in theatres and sharing that money with theatres, frankly. That's what it comes down to. To me, it's greed.\"\n\nHe said it was especially \"appalling\" for Amazon to have treated Ron Howard, the filmmaker behind huge, money-making movies such as The Da Vinci Code, that way.\n\nMortensen said: \"He's a very nice guy, so he hasn't gone out there complaining about it, but I'm happy to do it for him. I'm not speaking for him, I'm just speaking for myself. I think it was shameful what they did.\"\n\nThirteen Lives was quite well-reviewed, with The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey giving the film three stars and writing: \"Howard's focus is on documenting action rather than capturing emotion - the claustrophobia, the ravenous grief, the shadow of guilt around the corner, ready to pounce if the wrong decision is made. We see little of the children themselves, and the abject terror they must have experienced spending 18 days in the dark.\n\n\"But, in an industry full of boastful fantasists and relentless exploitation, you have to be thankful for someone like Howard. He cares about the stories he tells. And that's rare.\"\n\nA 2021 documentary film about the disaster, called The Rescue - made by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin - received huge critical acclaim. In an interview promoting the documentary, Stanton (played by Mortensen in the dramatisation) told The Independent about how they carried out their \"preposterous\" plan to save the boys.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viggo_Mortensen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viggo Mortensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Lives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thirteen Lives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Stanton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_screening", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test screening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Edgerton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Edgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Farrell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colin Farrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Chai_Vasarhelyi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Chin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Chin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claustrophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claustrophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Da Vinci Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/51e841b162c8da8a9a9d05099674fc79", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742226", "eventUri": "eng-9742226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The film in question is the Ron Howard directed Thirteen Lives, which was slated for a limited theatrical run in 2022. However, the film's time in theaters was very limited, as Amazon made the decision to pull the film early in order to release it on their streaming service. Mortensen, best known for playing Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings, starred in Ron Howard's acclaimed movie about the rescue of a trapped Thai soccer team, and had nothing but condemnation over the way the film's release was handled by Amazon MGM Studios.\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair, Mortensen held nothing back as he took shots at Jeff Bezos and the executives at Amazon who he says prioritized profits and greed over the cinematic experience. The actor started off by setting the stage, saying he believes that theaters are still the best place to watch movies. Mortensen said:\n\n\"There are less slots for these films to be shown in movie theaters. Call me old-fashioned, but I like seeing movies in movie theaters - and I like people seeing my movies in theaters.\"\n\nAfter amping himself up, Mortensen let out a verbal barrage on Bezos and the executives behind the questionable decision to pull Thirteen Lives early from theaters. Mortensen continued:\n\n\"They have all their excuses for why they did that, but it comes down to greed. How much money do you need? I think Amazon could certainly have respected the deal, as they said they were going to, and released it widely in theaters and let it have its run. And then they could have also made money streaming.

That's what it comes down to. To me, it's greed.\"\n\nViggo Mortensen Was Left Confused After the Release Change Close\n\nSadly, in the modern age of streaming, companies shifting their release strategy to cut overall costs isn't anything new. Prime Video were criticized by fans, and the director, of the Road House remake for canceling its theatrical release in favor of streaming. Looking back at the handling of Thirteen Lives' release, Viggo Mortensen wasn't just angry, he was left feeling incredibly confused.\n\nRelated Amazon Freevee Called Out for Using Bizarre AI Generated Movie Posters\n\nFreevee used AI to produce a haunting thumbnail for Sidney Lumet's classic 12 Angry Men.\n\nThirteen Lives was well received by critics and audiences, holding a strong 85% on Rotten Tomatoes (with an even stronger 94% audience score). But Mortensen already knew that audiences would love the film, thanks to early test screenings. The screenings gave incredibly positive results, which were heavily in favor of a cinematic release. Mortensen explained:\n\n\"That was a movie that MGM made, and when they did their test screenings for that movie, they got the highest scores in the history of that studio, and they got really excited and decided that that year, that November, they were going to put it out worldwide in many, many, many thousands of theaters. Basically, you saw that movie for a week in Chicago, New York, and LA, London, and that was that.

It also featured performances from Colin Farrell and Joel Edgerton.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, the actor said the film was a \"really good movie\" that MGM had intended to \"put out worldwide in many, many, many thousands of theatres\" after it \"got the highest scores in the history of that studio\" in its test screenings.\n\nHe added: \"Then Amazon bought MGM, initially promised to respect the deal that MGM had made with [director] Ron Howard, and then they went back on that. Basically you saw that movie for a week in Chicago, New York and LA, London, and that was that.\n\n\"Then you had the streaming, which I thought was really sad. It's a really well-shot movie.\"\n\nHe continued: \"They have all their excuses for why they did that, but it comes down to greed. How much money do you need? I think Amazon could certainly have respected the deal, as they said they were going to, and released it widely in theatres and let it have its run. And then they could have also made money streaming.\n\n\"But they figured it would be more cost-effective - i.e., they would make more money - if they didn't have to bother with spending money on promoting it and putting in theatres and sharing that money with theatres, frankly. That's what it comes down to. To me, it's greed.\"\n\nHe said it was especially \"appalling\" for Amazon to have treated Ron Howard, the filmmaker behind huge, money-making movies such as The Da Vinci Code, that way.\n\nMortensen said: \"He's a very nice guy, so he hasn't gone out there complaining about it, but I'm happy to do it for him. I'm not speaking for him, I'm just speaking for myself. I think it was shameful what they did.\"\n\nThirteen Lives was quite well-reviewed, with The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey giving the film three stars and writing: \"Howard's focus is on documenting action rather than capturing emotion - the claustrophobia, the ravenous grief, the shadow of guilt around the corner, ready to pounce if the wrong decision is made. We see little of the children themselves, and the abject terror they must have experienced spending 18 days in the dark.\n\n\"But, in an industry full of boastful fantasists and relentless exploitation, you have to be thankful for someone like Howard. He cares about the stories he tells. And that's rare.\"\n\nA 2021 documentary film about the disaster, called The Rescue - made by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin - received huge critical acclaim. In an interview promoting the documentary, Stanton (played by Mortensen in the dramatisation) told The Independent about how they carried out their \"preposterous\" plan to save the boys.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viggo_Mortensen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viggo Mortensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Lives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thirteen Lives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Stanton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caving", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Edgerton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Edgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Farrell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colin Farrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_screening", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test screening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Chai_Vasarhelyi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Chin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Chin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claustrophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claustrophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Da Vinci Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/12/15/newFile-3.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742226", "eventUri": "eng-9742226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Still, for a film about feats of next-level bravery, Thirteen Lives is a little too cautious to really soar.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Mortensen also took aim at major movie franchises, which he described as \"predictable\" and \"not usually well-written\".\n\nWhen asked why he had not taken part in any such series since The Lord Of The Rings, he said: \"I don't really look for or avoid any kind of genre or any size budget. I just look for interesting stories. It doesn't matter to me what the genre is or what the budget is or who's making them. I would never do a movie just because so-and-so is directing it. It has to be about the story. And if I think I'm right for the character, that always comes first.\"\n\n\"That goes for franchises,\" he continued. \"If somebody came to me with X movie, the third part or the ninth part, and I thought it was a great character and I wanted to play that character and I thought I had something to contribute, I'd do it. I'm not against it.\n\n\"But they're not usually that good. I mean, to me, they're not usually that well-written. They're kind of predictable.

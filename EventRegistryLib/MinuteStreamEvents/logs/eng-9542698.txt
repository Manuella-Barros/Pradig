Today we made them happy and this is the reason I work every day and wake up every day - to see people enjoy days like today.\n\n\"Fantastic feeling. I said before the game to the players, yes the game is important, but enjoy the moment because in our lives as a footballer and manager, most of the time you're not going to win and when you do win, you have to enjoy it. Enjoy today with family and friends.\"\n\nMaresca also insisted that losing the game didn't taken the gloss off the title celebrations, pointing to the surprising fact that all four teams at risk of the drop won their respective games. \"If you see Birmingham, they won; Plymouth, they won; Sheffield Wednesday, they won; Blackburn, they won,\" he said.\n\n\"When you play to survive and the other team doesn't play... it happens.

Parma boss and an assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, Maresca made the switch to Leicester last summer.\n\nIn his first season in charge at the King Power Stadium, the Italian was able to deliver promotion for the Foxes, who won the Championship title.\n\nAs a result, the East Midlands outfit will return to the Premier League after one year away, yet it may not be a seamless transition back to the top flight courtesy of issues with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability regulations.\n\nMaresca's side face the possibility of beginning 2024-25 with a points deduction, although any punishment for rule breaches is yet to be decided.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nLa Liga club monitoring Maresca situation\n\nFurthermore, Leicester and Maresca face a complex task to sufficiently improve the first-team squad, with at least one sale possibly required to free up some funds for new arrivals.\n\nWhether that situation will impact on Maresca's future remains to be seen, yet the 44-year-old has a contract at Leicester until 2026.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Sevilla are taking an interest in Maresca as they consider how to handle their own managerial situation.\n\nSevilla have been excellent in recent weeks, collecting 13 points from a possible 15 to ensure that relegation is no longer a possibility and a top-10 finish is still achievable.\n\nQuique Sanchez Flores has recorded 10 wins and four draws from his 21 matches in charge, suggesting that he could be the right man to lead Los Nervionenses forward.\n\nThe report claims, though, that Sevilla are contemplating whether to make an approach for Maresca having been left impressed with his brand of football.\n\nOther clubs hold an interest\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nTeams in the Premier League and across Europe are also said to have Maresca on their shortlist, although it remains to be seen whether he would be tempted to leave a role that has been successful thus far.\n\nMeanwhile, Flores still has just under 14 months remaining on his contract at Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan and has arguably already done enough to win over a large portion of the club's supporters.\n\nSevilla face a tough conclusion to the season, however,

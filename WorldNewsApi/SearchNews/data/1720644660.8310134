The 18-year-old left-hander closed the match by breaking Fernandez's serve at love at the same Roland Garros venue where Paralympic tennis will be played this summer. Oda has now won this year's first two Grand Slams. A win at the U.S. Open will complete a career Grand Slam. \"It's always tough to play against you,\" Oda said of his opponent in a post-match on-court interview. \"You have so much power, so I try my best to go beyond (deal with) your power.\" Oda converted seven of his 12 break points in the final and did not drop a set in his four matches. A year ago at Roland Garros, Oda became the youngest Grand Slam champion in wheelchair tennis history at age 17. Oda began using a wheelchair after he was diagnosed with bone cancer in his left hip joint when he was 9 years old.

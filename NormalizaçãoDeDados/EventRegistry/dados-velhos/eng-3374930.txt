What is your take?\n\nThat is an indication that after the Supreme Court judgment, the party and its members have come together and I believe the convention brought everybody on board with the understanding that our differences have been resolved. It was in unity that we passed all the motions and extended the life of the Senator Ahmed Makarfi - led Caretaker Committee in preparation for an elective convention coming up in December. Our party members, stakeholders, leaders, supporters and loyalists across the country are very happy about the successes recorded at that convention.\n\nYou saw the enthusiasm that was displayed by the members of the PDP at the convention. Everybody was happy because better days are here again for the PDP, especially against the backdrop of what we suffered in the past. For almost two years, the party was in crisis, but now the PDP is out of crisis and, for the first time since we lost the presidential election in 2015, we were able to come to the Eagle Square as one united party under one strong umbrella, to rekindle the hope that all is not lost in our country.\n\nNow that the tenure of the Caretaker Committee has been extended by four months, what would you tell the committee and the party members ahead of the elective convention?\n\nAs an executive member of the party, I am aware that the Caretaker Committee is ever ready to work tirelessly to make sure that the December convention takes place. And across the nation, our party supporters are are ready to come and elect their officers; they are working, working really hard.\n\nWith the non- elective convention, it appears all is well with the party?\n\nAll the differences have been settled and you are aware that the Supreme Court gave judgment and that judgement represents the aspiration of the majority of members of the party.\n\nAhead of the 2019 elections, how prepared is the PDP?\n\nIt is a long journey and we will not like to disclose our strategies. But first, we have to put our house in order. All we are doing is to continue to work hard for the party, win more party followers, those who are outside and those who left the party for the APC, in preparation for the general elections that would come in 2019. It is a lot of hard work. We will be having a new strategy and a new narrative. I believe that following what happened in the16 years that we were in power and what has happened in the last two years, the party has learnt a lot of lessons and the PDP will not repeat the mistakes that were made. From what we saw at the non-elective convention, one would be bold to say that the PDP is on the march again and, by the grace of God, come 2019, Nigerians will vote the PDP, considering what we have experienced from 2015 to date. PDP has been a pioneering party in Nigeria that formed the federal government, a party that did not only build credible institutions of government, but also helped to create the institution of democracy which we are enjoying today in Nigeria. It is good to also test the other side, today we know the difference and I will say the difference is that of between day and night. I think what would be the first agenda, the foremost agenda of the PDP, is that those institutions that have been established by the PDP government to fight corruption, the PDP government that is coming, God's willing ,would take the institutions to greater heights as that would ensure that corruption is fought in the most civilized manner, not witch - hunting but by the rule of law.\n\nIt would be fought at the grassroots, in all spheres of our nation. In fact, we have an agenda that when it is unveiled, the whole country will welcome it.\n\nYou said that PDP has learnt its lessons. Can you give instances where the PDP made mistakes?\n\nOf course after establishing the institutions to fight corruption, the EFCC, the ICPC and the rest of them, I believe that the mistake the PDP made was that the much needed strength to prosecute and to fight it from the root was not there. Yes, some successes were recorded, but not to the knowledge of the people. I believe that, that was one mistake that we made and it is a major mistake. This time, we have to purge ourselves and we will ensure that everyone that would occupy public office will be properly screened and I believe that, that is the beginning and that person will take an oath administered by the party that he will fight corruption on a scale acceptable to Nigerians and the international community.\n\nWhat is your take on the calls for restructuring and devolution of power?\n\nSo much power is given to the centre; that is not done anywhere in the world where democracy is practiced. Power belongs to the people and should be decentralized. Let's not be sentimental about it, let the people at the grassroots have power to conduct their affairs; for instance in the regional days, chiefs and community leaders had the responsibility to make returns on taxes in their areas. That is decentralization; that is restructuring. But when power is concentrated at the centre, it is a like a central command structure, a unitary form of government and we erroneouly call it federal system.Restructuring means quite a lot to our people, especially those who are old enough to see what was obtainable in the regional days when substantial power was given to the regions and the regions gave power to the communities; there must be community participation; that is restructuring. When the communities don't participate, a situation where everybody looks up to Abuja, things cannot work. And that is why you can see that roads are not maintained, unlike in those days when the community will maintain the roads. Now, everybody is sitting back and waiting for Abuja to repair the roads. Everybody also waits for money to come from Abuja. We should leave sentiments and go back to the basics. There must be community participation and involvement in government.\n\nWhat about state police?\n\nIt is absolutely necessary because even during the regional days, there was the Adandoka in the Northern Region and in the Eastern Region, we had court messengers. These were the people who enforced the laws and made sure that those who were eligible to pay tax paid. So, if you like, call it community police and you still have the federal police that have the overriding powers, just like what is practiced in the United States where the state has its own police, the community has its own police but they still have the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that oversees everything. Our own police can be restructured in such a way that everybody will be involved and everybody will participate.\n\nThere is tension in the land. Pro - Biafan groups are agitating in the South-East. Some northern youths some time ago gave quit notice to the Igbo resident in the North and, some days ago, some Niger Delta agitators gave quit notice to northerners and the Yoruba resident in the oil-rich region.\n\nWhat is your take on these agitations?\n\nThis is the failure of government. The government is broken, absolutely broken; the absence of the Commander-in-Chief may have caused quite a lot and you know that there is no country in the world where a President is absent for a very long time and a few people would gather and call themselves a cabal, which means that we have several Presidents ruling the country. Yes on paper they say Acting President is in place but the reality is that the cabal is in charge and that is what we are seeing today. This government is completely broken, the people should see it. Is this the kind of government they voted for? Is this the government they envisaged? We need a government that has the interest of all the people of Nigeria at heart irrespective of whether you are from the North, the East or West. We need a united Nigeria and a party that can put the nation together. This APC government cannot unite this country. The people are disillusioned, the people are not happy about the way things have gone in the last two years. There is so much distrust, dishonesty in the system and the party in power is not speaking the truth; that is the message we will be preaching in a couple of months ahead.\n\nHow is your state, Rivers, doing?\n\nRivers State is doing well; it is God's own state. You are aware that we have passed through a lot and those who are planning evil against the state will know that they are not God because God has reversed all their plans. We believe that it is only God that can deliver us from the hands of the enemies of Rivers State.\n\nWhat is your message to Nigerians?\n\nLet there be peace, let there be unity, let the people come together because there will be another opportunity to compare and contrast whether the APC controlled government has performed very well or not. They cannot unite the country, the country is virtually irreparably divided under their government, the country is broken and the alternative is the PDP. So let us come together and vote them out.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:18:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374930", "time": "00:18:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374930", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "164", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "75105", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Government"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government", "score": 2}, {"id": "303921", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "score": 3}, {"id": "304183", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "score": 2}, {"id": "305564", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Igbo people"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people", "score": 2}, {"id": "305567", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "score": 4}, {"id": "306089", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "score": 2}, {"id": "306096", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Niger Delta"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta", "score": 2}, {"id": "321277", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Yoruba people"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people", "score": 2}, {"id": "330992", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "score": 4}, {"id": "338959", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ahmed Makarfi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Makarfi", "score": 3}, {"id": "1366107", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Uche Secondus"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uche_Secondus", "score": 4}], "image": "http://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Secondus-e1503177218488.png", "timeCrawl": "00:18:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "This APC govt. is absolutely broken to defend Nigeria's unity  -- Secondus, ex-PDP Acting Chairman - Vanguard News", "originalArticle": null}

Speaking through the spokesman of his sacked National Working Committee (NWC), Bernard Mikko, the former Borno governor said his group will react extensively to the judgement after receiving briefs from its lawyers.\n\nOne month after the judgement, the former National Chairman is still mute. He has equally boycotted the series of meetings held by the various organs of the PDP to chart a new course for the opposition party and other party activities.\n\nSheriff was also conspicuously absent from the PDP Special non elective convention held in Abuja last week. Apart from the former Borno governor, some of his supporters absent from the convention included his former deputy, Dr Cairo Ojougboh, and former National Secretary of the party, Professor Wale Oladipo.\n\nThis is regardless of his pledge prior to the apex court judgment to accept the adjudication in good faith.\n\nSheriff, who is by virtue of his status as a former national chairman of the PDP, a member of the National Caucus, Board of Trustees (BoT), National Executive Committee (NEC), of the party, had said he did not attend the first set of meetings of the party organs held after the Supreme Court judgment because he was not invited.\n\nBut the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Prince Dayo Adeyeye said no special invitation was extended to party leaders, who attended the meetings, including former President Goodluck Jonathan. According to him, all the party leaders went to the meetings through public announcements in the media.\n\nSheriff's silence and absence from party activities has no doubt given room to a lot of speculations, as pundits wonder about his next political moves.\n\nBut a leader of the party in Nasarawa State and former deputy governor of the state, Senator Solomon Ewuga had told Sunday Sun that there is need for the party to lose sleep over the former Borno State governor and his supporters.\n\nAccording to him, it is left for Sheriff and his group to either ship in or ship out of the party.\n\nHe noted that the former Borno State governor is technically not a member of the party at the moment, going by the apex court declaration that he does not even have the PDP membership card.\n\n\"They (Sheriff's loyalists) are either In PDP or they are not. For Sheriff, let him be a member of the party first. He is not even a member of the party at the moment. Didn't hear, when the Supreme Court said he does not even have a membership card. You cannot be a party member, when you do not have a membership card\", Ewuga stated.\n\nHowever, amidst fear that Sheriff might use members loyal to him to trigger off another round of crisis, former Minister of Works, Senator Adeseye Ogunlewe says the focus of the PDP reconciliation moves should be his supporters.\n\nOgunlewe told Sunday Sun in a recent telephone interview that the former Borno governor should never be allowed to go away with any party member in the event that he chooses to leave the PDP, as he did not bring any member when he was coming into the party.\n\n\"Sheriff did not bring any member into the party. It is the members we should be appealing to. They are the most important people in reconciliation moves. They must be brought back into the fold,\" the former minister stated.\n\nIn a twist, a member of his sacked NWC who pleaded anonymity told Sunday Sun that the former PDP chairman and his key allies have decided to stay back in the PDP and continue the struggle.\n\nAccording to him, \"We are not going anywhere. We are staying.This is a party that we have committed so much time, energy and resources to build.We can not now abandon it for impostors. We will stay back and fight it out. You have seen nothing. The real fight has just began.\"\n\nIn the same vein, spokesman of the sacked Sheriff led PDP NWC, Bernard Mikko, who confirmed to Sunday Sun that the group met in Abuja on Wednesday to evaluate the turn of events in the party, said they won't leave the opposition party.\n\nMikko had in a recent statement said:\"No one owns the party and those making unguarded and reckless statements in the public domain should realise that the solution to the problem of Nigeria is beyond any political association. Unacceptable and unjustifiable means cannot lead to a justifiable and acceptable end.\"\n\nInside sources said the former Borno governor is still dazed by the Supreme Court judgment that pulled the rug off his seat.\n\nIt was gathered that after securing victory in the party's leadership in the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt, Sheriff had planned to conduct a convention, where he would install one of his supporters as national chairman and thereafter concentrate on his much speculated presidential ambition.\n\nThose in the know, said Sheriff eye has all along been on the presidential ticket of the PDP. It was this presidential ambition that allegedly led to a rift between him and PDP, as he was said to have promised several of them that they would be his vice presidential candidate in the 2019 polls.\n\nUnfortunately, the Supreme Court judgment did not go in his favour as he had anticipated. Consequently, all his 2019 plans has seemingly come to naught.\n\nAlthough one of his close allies, who spoke on anonymity, said the former Borno State governor has never nursed the ambition to be PDP Presidential candidate in 2019, noting that the presidential project was contrived by his opponents in the party in a bid to remove him as party leader.\n\nHowever, analysts say nothing prevents Sheriff from contesting the 2019 polls on the platform of the PDP if he so decides, and he is able to muster enough support to get the party ticket.\n\nObservers say Sheriff never actually had supporters in the real sense of it. Majority of those who tagged along with him while the crisis lasted did so because they lost out in the mainstream.\n\nNow, with the leadership crisis resolved in favour of the Makarfi led caretaker committee, most of the Sheriff supposed supporters are either retracing their steps back to the mainstream of the party or taking decision that will best serve their political interest.\n\nAlready, many members of the Sheriff camp had retraced their steps back into mainstream. Among the earliest is Okechukwu Nnadozie, who served as National Organising Secretary of the Sheriff NWC.\n\nOne of the loyalists of the former PDP chairman in Imo State, Chief Regis Uwakwe said majority of Sheriff's supporters in the State are still disposed to remaining in the PDP.\n\nHe, however, said they will be guided in their next political moves by the political dynamics in the South East state.\n\n\"More than 90 per cent of the people with Sheriff in Imo PDP are willing to remain in the party.\n\n\" Most of our leaders are still shocked by the Supreme Court judgment, but I believe that in the days ahead they will come to terms with the reality,\" Uwakwe stated.\n\nHowever, in the South West, some Sheriff's supporters are still in the trenches. Same with some of his supporters in Anambra.\n\nLast week , the group filed a suit before a Federal High Court in Abuja seeking an order for the nullification of the 75th National Executive Committee, NEC, meeting of the PDP and the resolution of the PDP Special Non-Elective Convention.\n\nSimilarly, a former chairman of the Ogun State chapter, Adebayo Dayo is also praying the same court to set aside the dissolution of his exco by the NEC. The suits from Sheriff's men in the South West are an indication.\n\nThe convention had ratified the dissolution of parallel state executive committee of the party in Anambra State by the caretaker committee last month and the subsequent setting up of a caretaker committee to manage the affairs of the PDP in the state.\n\nThe PDP convention had also dissolved the party the executive committees in Adamawa, Kebbi, Borno, Kwara, Lagos, Osun and Ogun states and recognised the South West zonal executive committee led by Eddy Olafeso, leaving the erstwhile zonal executive loyal to former Borno governor in the cold.\n\nApparently in reaction to the turn of events in the party, one of the loyalists of the former PDP leader in Edo State, Matthew Iduoriyekemwen announced his resignation from the party. Iduoriyekemwen, a two -time PDP governorship aspirant in Edo State, crossed over to the Sheriff side, two days after he lost the party's governorship primary suprintended over by the caretaker committee.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:05:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 583, "textStart": 577, "date": "-05-21", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 660, "textStart": 653, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-12", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374930", "time": "02:05:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374930", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "164", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "74783", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "74906", "label": {"eng": "Kaduna State"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaduna_State", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kaduna State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "75044", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "75080", "label": {"eng": "Anambra State"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anambra_State", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anambra State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "75105", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "81069", "label": {"eng": "Nassarawa State"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasarawa_State", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nassarawa State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "306095", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Goodluck Jonathan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodluck_Jonathan", "score": 3}, {"id": "330992", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "score": 4}, {"id": "338959", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ahmed Makarfi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Makarfi", "score": 3}, {"id": "338960", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ali Modu Sheriff"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Modu_Sheriff", "score": 4}, {"id": "1271414", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imo (state)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_(state)", "score": 2}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "02:05:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "PDP: What is Sheriff's gameplan?", "originalArticle": null}

Associate Editor, Sam Egburonu, reports\n\nTHE Non-elective National Convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which held in Abuja last week's Saturday, was conceived as a unity gathering. Senator Ahmed Makarfi, the party's National Caretaker Committee Chairman, who the Supreme Court declared winner of the protracted leadership battle, had waved an olive branch to his rival, Senator Modu Sheriff and his supporters and reasoned that the Abuja gathering will cement a long lasting harmony within the party.\n\nAt a pre-convention briefing in Abuja a day before the convention, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Dayo Adeyeye, had said \"The policy of no victor, no vanquished has been implemented by the National Caretaker Committee. So we are going to have a unity convention tomorrow; everybody has been brought together, they have integrated. This is a unity convention.\"\n\nHe added: \"I want to assure you that those who were on the other side while we had a protracted court (battle), virtually all of them have been included to serve in this convention go and check the list. There is no legal issue at all regarding this convention.\"\n\nFollowing that submission, observers thought the division within the biggest opposition party had actually been resolved. On the day of the convention, the massive turn out, especially the presence of very influential elders and leaders of the party, suggested that the task of reconciliation in PDP may indeed have been accomplished to a very large extent. But while many stakeholders describe the convention as very successful, not a few contend that the absence of Sheriff and his closest associates like Senator Buruji Kashamu, at the convention, shows that the envisaged peace may not have been achieved after all. They expressed fear that the body language of Sheriff and his henchmen may indeed be a pointer to a possible plan to launch a fresh phase of the prolonged leadership crisis in the party.\n\nThe first tangible sign that all was not well yet, in spite of claims that all the concerned stakeholders have been brought on board, was noted during the expanded caucus meeting of the party held in Abuja in July. The meeting, which attracted prominent party members, including the immediate past President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, past and serving state governors, former and current members of the National Assembly, leaders of the women wings and other sectors, was described by a commentator as \"the first of its kind in the past 13 months of a lingering legal tussle which was terminated with the Supreme Court ruling that recognised the Senator Ahmed Makarfi-led National Caretaker Committee.\"\n\nThe large attendance at the caucus meeting was considered by informed observers as a sign that PDP was still alive and may in fact be on the path of great revival. Besides serving PDP governors and deputy governors, top PDP leaders in attendance included former President Goodluck Jonathan, former Vice President Namadi Sambo, Chairman of the 2017 Special Non-Elective National Convention Planning Committee, Sen. Arthur I. Okowa, former Governor of Akwa Ibom State and Senate Minority Leader, Chief Godswill Akpabio and Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BOT), Sen. Walid Jubril.\n\nBut amongst conspicuous absentees at the critical meeting were Senator Modu Sheriff, his deputy, Dr. Cairo Ojugboh and most of the other known backers of Sheriff's leadership.\n\nAlthough Sheriff was reported to be outside the country at the time of the caucus meeting, the proclamation of his supporters was instructive. For example, Honourable Bernard Mikko, his spokesperson, had in a statement said: \"Senator Modu Sheriff was neither in the country nor invited to the assemblage at Wadata Plaza yesterday evening. However, he will address a world press conference to throw light on the way forward after we have received and studied the full judgment of the Supreme Court and analyzed its import on our democracy.\n\n\"We therefore appeal to all our loyal supporters nationwide not to defect as we are still committed to bringing the party back to the grassroots. We assure them that we will not only give them a voice, but they will also be heard.\n\n\"We will collaborate with global anti-corruption networks to bring all corrupt politicians in Nigeria to book, including PDP members having criminal cases bordering on dishonesty and malfeasance. Never again will corrupt politicians use the platform of our major political institutions to stardom. The party is for all and no one's enterprise as government is conceived as an administrative state where dishonest politicians bask in democratic corruption.\"\n\nThe disturbing insinuations carefully hidden in the statement were not lost to many. So, as the August 12th non-elective convention drew nearer, observers were anxious to see if Sheriff and his close supporters have truly embraced the new leadership. Their absence at the event, described by an eyewitness as 'a colourful Abuja carnival,' therefore left a sour taste in the mouth of concerned stakeholders, who are looking forward to a united and revived PDP that will effectively tackle All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 General Election.\n\nDissolution of state executives\n\nBesides the extension of the tenure of Senator Ahmed Makarfi as the Caretaker Committee Chairman by three months, one of the major decisions taken at the Non-Elective Convention was the dissolution of state executive committees in seven states. While the extension seems widely accepted as a necessary policy that will allow the committee time \"to reorganise, strengthen and prepare the party to conduct an elective National Convention to elect new officers for PDP ahead 2019 General Election,\" the dissolution of state executive committees in some states has attracted negative responses from supporters of Sheriff. While party leaders said the dissolution was a fall out of the crises bedeviling the party in the affected states, a development that led to the existence of parallel and conflicting organs, some Sheriff supporters alleged that the affected state executive committees were the ones sympathetic to Sheriff. They said it was a masterstroke to undermine supporters of the former National Chairman of the party and enthrone Makarfi's men in preparation for 2019 General Election.\n\nThe states where the executive committees were dissolved include Adamawa, Borno, Kebbi, Kwara, Lagos, Ogun and Osun states. Earlier, PDP's National Caretaker Committee had dissolved all the factional executive committees of the party in Anambra State. To carry out the assignment, a meeting was convened with leaders and members of the party in the state to resolve all outstanding issues. A report confirming the action said \"The NCC in the exercise of its powers under Section 31, 2, today dissolves all the existing factional executive committees of the party in Anambra State.\" It added, \"The NCC will in due course, appoint a caretaker committee to run the affairs of the PDP in the State pending when it will be auspicious to elect executive committees at all levels.\" That state committee, led by Prof. ABC Nwosu, has already been constituted. At the non-elective National Convention, Makarfi-led National Caretaker Committee was empowered to set up State Caretaker Committees that would conduct states and local government congresses in the affected states while it ratified the results of the congresses held between May and March in 2016.\n\nSoon after the announcement of the affected PDP committees, affected members, especially Modu Sheriff's known allies, voiced their disagreements. Already, some of them have approached the court to put on hold the decisions of the non-elective convention.\n\nFor example, the dissolved Southwest PDP Zonal Executive Committee has filed a suit at a Federal High Court, Abuja, seeking an order nullifying the 75th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the PDP and the adoption at its special non-elective National Convention. Defendants in the suit include the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), PDP, Senator Ahmed Makarfi and Senator Ben Obi, Eddy Olafeso, Bunmi Jenyo and the Inspector-General of Police.\n\nThe committee, in the suit filed on behalf of members of the Southwest Zonal Executive Committee by its Zonal Secretary, Chief Pega Otemolu, prayed the court to grant an order nullifying the ratification by and/or affirmative resolution of the convention approving or effecting the dissolution of the PDP Southwest Executive Committee and the appointment of a Southwest Zonal Executive Committee.\n\nAlso in a suit filed by Adebayo Dayo and Alhaji Semiu Sodipo, as first and second plaintiffs for themselves and on behalf of Ogun Executive Committee of the PDP, the Ogun State chapter of the party prayed the court to set aside its dissolution by the National Executive Committee (NEC) and the National Convention. Defendants in the suit are the PDP and INEC.\n\nThey asked the court for \"an order nullifying the ratification by and/or affirmative resolution of the Special Non-Elective National Convention of the 1st defendant/respondent of August 12, 2017, sanctioning, approving or affecting the dissolution of the PDP Ogun State Executive Committee and the appointment of a State Caretaker Committee in replacement thereof.\n\nThe chapter also sought an order restraining INEC \"from supervising any congress in Ogun State or recognising any congress of the 1st defendant (PDP) in Ogun State during the subsistence of the tenure of the plaintiffs as officers of the Ogun State executive committee of the PDP, which expires in May 2020.\"\n\nThe court had, during the week, adjourned the matter till September 5 for hearing of pending applications.\n\nA stakeholder, Alhaji Adetunji Oluwadare, told The Nation on Friday that \"Ogun State and all the other affected state executive committees were targeted because they represent the support base of the Modu Sheriff group. You can see what is happening in PDP clearly. Where is the no victor, no vanquished propaganda? I can assure you that the in-fighting is not over. A group of power mongers cannot just bulldoze their way into a national party like PDP and through illegal ways attempt to hijack power all over the country,\" he said.\n\nOgun State Secretary of the dissolved executive committee, Alhaji Semiu Sodipo, had also told newsmen that their faction is \"still in control of the party in the state.\" Threatening to sue Makarfi-led National Caretaker Committee for contempt of court, he dismissed the non-elective National Convention as a gathering that lacks the power to dissolve the Ogun State PDP committee because, according to him, \"it is the only PDP executive committee recognised by the court in the state.\"\n\nIt would be recalled that the faction, loyal to the PDP National Caretaker Committee Chairman, Makarfi, had been struggling with the faction loyal to Senator Buruji Kashamu for the control of the party's state secretariat in Abeokuta. With the dissolution of the state executive committee loyal to Kashamu, the rivalry had been revived.\n\nAs soon as the news of the dissolution was made public, Senator Buruji Kashamu, representing Ogun-East Senatorial District, who is a prominent member of Senator Ali Modu Sheriff's camp, described the dissolution as \"illegal.\" He did not stop there but promised to challenge the action in a court of law.\n\nThe senator made the threat in a statement where he stated that the national leadership of PDP violated court order in the dissolution. According to him, \"the judgment recognising the executive councils in Ogun and the South-West was never appealed and as such is still subsisting.\n\n\"The Federal High Court, Abuja, on August 11 ruled: \"That an order is hereby made restraining the 2nd defendant from operating in the South- West zone of the party through any committee in which the applicant, Chief Pegba Otemolu and Chief Makanjuola Ogundipe are not members in the capacity of the secretary and chairman respectively of the South- West zonal executive of PDP pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.\n\n\"That an order of interim injunction is made restraining the 2nd defendant by itself, its officers, organs and delegates from recognising any harmonisation, restructuring or disruption of PDP leadership structures in the South- West zone (including any purported list of delegates for the special non-elective national convention of PDP schedule for August 12 or any other date during the tenure of office of the South- West Zonal Executive Committee of which the applicant is secretary, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.\"\n\nKashamu contended that this order was discountenanced by the National Caretaker Committee (NCC).\n\nHe warned that \"the supremacy of any party's constitution is subject to the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as clearly stated in Chapter 1, Section 2 of our party's constitution,\" adding that \"The Ogun State PDP executive under the leadership of Adebayo Dayo has a court judgment and orders legitimising it as the duly and validly elected state executive until 2020. This clearly allows the Adebayo Dayo-led executive to remain in office and carry out all its due responsibilities and functions.\n\n\"For the above reasons, the Dayo-led executive will remain in office till 2020 regardless of its purported dissolution, because the action taken by NEC and convention of the party is an illegal act,\" he insists.\n\nAlready, there are allegations within the South-West zone that the dissolution of the state executive committees in the south-West was to favour some powerful leaders like Governor Ayo Fayose of Ekiti State and Chief Bode George, the former Deputy National Chairman of the party.\n\nIn Kwara State, a faction has also dragged PDP to court over the same matter.\n\nSheriff's future moves\n\nInsiders within the Senator Modu Sheriff's faction of PDP confided during the week that following the decision to dissolve the state executive committees loyal to the former PDP Chairman, it has become clear that the winners of the last Supreme Court's ruling on the leadership of PDP are not ready to share power with anybody. According to one of the top associates of Sheriff in Anambra, who pleaded not to be named, \"this is clearly a case of fight to finish. For us, there is a major decision to take: Whether to remain in the family and fight injustices and impositions or to leave. In my state and other affected states, there are many meetings going on, on how to reconcile offended members. I may not be able to reveal how successful it has been here in Anambra, the other states and at the national level but I can assure you that in a few days and weeks, the future would be clearer. But we all know that the last has not been heard of the PDP leadership crisis because it is evident that our leaders have not learnt enough.\"\n\nMore than ever before, the question in the minds of election analysts in Nigeria today, is whether the former ruling party will be able to shake off the internal crises that has bedeviled it since it lost the presidential election in 2015 to the All Progressives Party (APC) and stand on its feet before and during the next general election in 2019.\n\nFor Sheriff and many of his ardent supporters who never thought of losing at the Supreme Court, this is the time to make final decision on the way forward. It would be recalled that before the apex court's ruling, informed analysts had predicted several scenarios, most of which suggested that no matter which way the judgement would go, it is not likely that what used to be PDP will ever remain a united family.\n\nGovernor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State, who probably feared that his faction would lose, had fired the first salvo when he said that critical stakeholders of the PDP, including himself, would leave the party if the then pending Supreme Court judgment favoured the Ali Modu-Sheriff faction of the party. As the Chairman of PDP Governors' Forum, his statement then that no law would bar him from leaving the party for another confirmed how deep the disagreement had gone.\n\n\"I am still a member of the PDP and still the chairman of the PDP Governors' Forum. There are no two sides to it. But the strategy for the next poll is strictly my own business. No law says I should not run on the platform of another party if the PDP is no longer a right direction depending on circumstances. There is no such law to the best of my knowledge.\n\n\"If they are bent on destroying the PDP, let them go ahead but I will never have anything to do with Senator Modu-Sheriff. The party is like a vehicle and the vehicle can't be more important than the driver. Critical stakeholders of the PDP, including myself, would leave the party if the pending Supreme Court judgment favours the Ali Modu-Sheriff faction of the party,\" Fayose said. Of course Sheriff lost and Makarfi, Fayose's choice, won.\n\nAlso, Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, another supporter of Makarfi had followed the Fayose's style as he vowed then that he would not work under the leadership of Sheriff in PDP should the Supreme Court affirm him as the leader of the party. He said working under Sheriff's leadership \"is against my belief and tradition.\"\n\nAside Fayose and Wike, other chieftains of the party who reportedly hinted on the possibility of exiting the party should Sheriff be declared the chairman by the Supreme Court, included Hon. Emeka Ihedioha, former Deputy Speaker, Hon Leo Ogor, Minority Leader of House of Representatives, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, amongst others. Following such declarations, speculations about a third force became a common feature. One of such possible alternative parties was Advance Peoples Democratic Alliance (APDA) which was unveiled in Abuja with pomp and pageantry.\n\nSheriff, according to reports had in his response then said Fayose, Wike and many others like them can leave the opposition party. He said \"We are moving on with the determination to reposition the party. We are not interested in the funding of the party from the governors. They are free to leave if they want to, especially Wike and Fayose. We are also not interested in their money. The party belongs to the people, they will finance it. So, if the governors want to withhold money from the party, they are free. We don't receive stolen money. They have not been funding us and we are surviving,\" he said.\n\nSuch extreme responses not-withstanding, Makarfi had, after his declaration by the apex court as the authentic chairman of the party, declared no victor, no vanquished position. But sources allege that Makarfi's allies do not want reconciliation but would prefer total exit of Sheriff and his closest allies. Already, tongues are wagging as to whether Sheriff and his men are set to move in mass to another party or remain in PDP and fight what they described as 'gross illegality.' Given the resolution of some affected South-West stakeholders to head to court during the week, it is likely Sheriff and his group may resist the pressure to quit.

But the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which was ousted from power in 2015 by the All Progressives Congress (APC), has vowed to make a comeback in 2019. The PDP's resolve to upstage the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government was reinforced at its recent mini convention in Abuja where the party's bigwigs vowed to dethrone the governing APC using the slogan: 'Change the Change'.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had released the timetable for the 2019 elections in March this year, indicating that the next presidential and National Assembly elections will hold on February 16, 2019. If President Buhari decides to re-contest in 2019, he would certainly face gladiators from the main opposition PDP, many of whom have already started aligning their interests for the presidential ticket ahead of the elections. Daily Trust on Sunday takes a look at seven heavyweights from amongs which, the PDP's champion may emerge to face President Buhari.\n\nWithin the eight years that Senator Ahmed Makarfi was governor of Kaduna State (from 1999 to 2007), he was credited with the ability to mitigate religious and ethnic violence in the state and has, through that feat, projected himself as an objective and fair-minded leader.\n\nHis outstanding performance in the state's infrastructural development with his focus on rural roads, rural water and rural electrification shot him into national limelight.\n\nMakarfi was a senator in 2007-15 where he chaired the committee on Appropriation. Though he lost the bid to return for a third time in 2015, his profile rose further when PDP governors and party members appointed him Chairman of the party at the Port Harcourt convention that held last year.\n\nSince then he had been battling for the position with former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, until recently when the Supreme Court ruled in his favour.\n\nMakarfi is expected to relinquish the PDP chairmanship, which has been zoned to the Southwest, but he is already a likely candidate for its presidential ticket, which was zoned to the North, especially given the trust key members of the party, especially serving governors, have in him. If he eventually secures the PDP ticket, he is likely to face President Buhari in the 2019 presidential race.\n\nAlhaji Sule Lamido, a former two-term governor of Jigawa State, has already commenced campaign for the PDP ticket ahead of 2019. In April last year, he reportedly told newsmen in his village, Bamaina in Birnin Kudu Local Government Area of the State, \"If my party finds me worthy of the party's presidential ticket to serve Nigeria, I will thank God and oblige.\"\n\nTwo weeks after he was released on bail from prison over allegations of incitement preferred against him by the Jigawa State Government in May this year, Lamido unveiled his 2019 presidential bid during a dinner for the 36 state chairmen of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) held in Abuja.\n\nLamido is one of the most experienced politicians in Nigeria today, having been a prominent PRP member of the House of Representatives in the Second Republic and also serving as a leading member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the Third Republic. He was also Obasanjo's Foreign Affairs Minister between 1999 and 2003.\n\nAs governor of Jigawa, he earned kudos for executing many worthwhile infrastructural projects including roads, airport and a state university. Throughout his political career however, Lamido's reputation is that of a political hothead who is known for controversies and ruffling political feathers.\n\nA former Vice President for eight years, Atiku Abubakar is a political heavyweight in Nigeria with considerable political machinery especially in Northern Nigeria at his service. Atiku, who never hides his presidential ambition, had contested the 2007 presidential election on the platform of the defunct Action Congress (AC) after realizing that he could not get the PDP ticket because of his frosty relationship with then President Obasanjo. Atiku also contested for the PDP presidential ticket against President Goodluck Jonathan in 2011. He again vied for APC's ticket in 2014 against President Buhari, finishing third at the Lagos convention.\n\nThe action, body language and utterances of the Waziri of Adamawa are enough to show that he is prepared to take another shot at the presidential race in 2019. In the past year Atiku became a vocal voice for restructuring, a move seen as a strategy to woo the South-South and South-East, regions where Buhari is less popular. In the North, Atiku's strategy is to insist on a \"power shift\" to the North East. He has been saying since 1999 that the North West has marginalised the North East in top political offices. Those strategies are backed by very deep pockets and one of the greatest determinations in Nigerian politics. Atiku celebrated his 70th birthday recently and his renewed determination probably stems from a calculation that 2019, when he will be 72, is his last chance.\n\nHowever, Atiku's political reputation over the years has been harmed by his frequent change of political parties in pursuit of his presidential ambition. In the run up to 2019, though still an APC stalwart, it is possible that he may again return to the PDP to jostle for its presidential ticket. He is already laying grounds for that because he recently attacked APC as a party without internal democracy.\n\nEkiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose is largely seen as fearless as a result of his controversial comments and leadership style. His February 21, 2017 declaration of presidential ambition in 2019 was also seen by commentators as a joke, but he seems quite serious about it. Some insiders are already calling him the 'Donald Trump of Nigeria.'\n\nThe 56-year-old Fayose, who is the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, expressed his interest in the presidency during a live television interview saying that in the near future, he will take over the mantle to lead the nation as his future was tied to the presidency.\n\n\"It is not by power; it is destiny. I did not believe it when I became Ekiti governor. After eight years, I will be the vice president of Nigeria, even the President very soon,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nThe maverick governor may however have to contend with an array of other interests within the PDP, some of who are seen as having brighter chances.\n\nHe has also echoed his resolve to be president in May this year when he met with political office holders at Government House, Ado Ekiti.\n\n\"I have a penchant for taking powers. That one in Buhari's hand, I will take it. I'm going straight to that villa. I'm the next president. I want to be the next president of Nigeria. My own won't be this change that has brought nothing, we are going to represent the people well and tell them the truth,\" he said.\n\nSenator David Mark, a retired military general, was military Governor of Niger State from 1984 to 1986. He later became a minister of Communications in 1987. He went on self-exile from 1993 to 1998 following the annulment of the June 12 1993 election. With the return to democracy in 1999, he contested for the Benue South Senatorial seat on the platform of the PDP and won. He was re-elected to serve from 2003 to 2007 and re-contested and won. He became Senate President from 2007 to 2011 and got re-elected for a fourth tenure from 2011 to 2015.\n\nWhen the curtains fell on the 7th session of Nigeria's National Assembly, Mark who was one of the most prominent characters of that era, retreated backstage as a member of the 8th session after his party became a minority. As senate president, Mark was known for his ignoble role in deepening and institutionalizing the culture of secrecy at Nigeria's federal legislative body.\n\nWhile the leadership crisis in the PDP between Makarfi and Sheriff festered, Mark, initially maintained silence until last April.\n\nIn a statement by Paul Mumeh, his media aide, Mark reportedly said the problem with the party had persisted because the major actors in the peace talks were not coming with open minds.\n\nMark, however, vowed to remain in the party despite the challenges while also criticizing those who have left the party.\n\nMark became relatively passive in the Senate, maintaining a posture of 'siddon look' in the 8th Assembly, which brought him under verbal attacks from many Nigerians. Mark later attributed his silence to the defeat suffered by his party in the 2015 elections.\n\nAlthough he has not openly indicated his interest to run for the Presidency, campaign posters of the former Senate President have started flooding some parts of the country, including on social media. If the posters are anything to go by, it means Mark would also be seeking the PDP's presidential ticket to slug it out with Buhari in 2019.\n\nA former governor of Cross River State, Donald Duke entered into public service for the first time in 1991 when he was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors of Voice of Nigeria (VON). In 1992, he was appointed a member of the Cross River State Executive Council where he held the portfolio of Commissioner for Finance, Budget and Planning.\n\nHe created the idea of Obudu Ranch International Mountain race which became one of the most lucrative mountain competitions in the world under his stewardship. Duke also started the Tinapa Resort project as a way to boost business and tourism in the state.\n\nAs Governor of Cross River State, Duke was praised for his contributions to the fields of Agriculture, Urban Development, governance, environment, information and communication. It was through his efforts that Calabar, the capital of Cross River State, is being seen today as the 'cleanest city in Nigeria.'\n\nDuke first announced that he would run for president in 2007 but later stepped aside for the eventual winner, the late Umaru Yar' Adua.\n\nIn May this year, the former governor declared that he wants to be Nigeria's President at a programme, \"The Nigerian Symposium for Emerging Leaders,\" held in Lagos.\n\nDuke said though he once aspired to the position but did not emerge the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, he would still contest for the highest office in the country at the appropriate time. He explained that it was because of his preference for the presidential seat that he did not vie for any federal legislative seat after serving out his terms as governor.\n\n\"I do not have the flair for the legislature; standing up and sitting down at the chambers to raise a point. That was why I did not contest for the Senate but the presidency, after serving out my term as governor. I have contested the presidency before; I will still give it a shot when the opportunity presents itself. I believe I still have the energy in me,\" he said.\n\nWith the passage of the Not Too Young to Run bill into law, Duke who is relatively younger may want to take advantage to make history as Nigeria's youngest elected president. And if he emerges the PDP's presidential ticket bearer, he would one of the youngest candidates to contest.\n\nA former Accountant General of the Federation, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo was elected governor of Gombe State in 2011 and was re-elected on the platform of his party, the PDP, in 2015.\n\nAs one of the two PDP governors in the North who had made himself a national figure, he has reportedly commenced moves to secure the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential ticket for the 2019 general elections. Dankwambo's interest is largely predicated on the zoning of the PDP's Presidential ticket to the North. It is believed that he would seek the support of Nigerian governors who have always endorsed one of themselves for the presidential slot to actualize his ambition. However whether Dankwambo has the financial wherewithal as well as the political clout to slug it out with other gladiators for the PDP presidential ticket remains to be seen. Should he emerge the ticket bearer, Dankwambo would then have to face President Buhari if he decides to seek re-election in 2019.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:41:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd":

It was the convention, vested with the power to do so, that said we should continue for an extra four months. It did not give us four months for the fun of it but to do some certain jobs. It will be recalled that seven states' (Peoples Democratic Party) leadership structure was dissolved at the convention. We were mandated to set up caretaker committees in those states and then conduct elective congresses there. The convention must have calculated the time to do all this. That was how it decided to extend our tenure by four months. You will also recall that we set up committees on reconciliation so that reasonable conciliation could be achieved, especially for those who were willing to be reconciled. Some are not willing to be reconciled and some are using their attitude to draw the party backwards. We will not waste our time and efforts on them. An overwhelming set of people has since been (re-)integrated into the party. So, this (re-)integration agenda will continue for those willing.\n\nDon't you think dissolving the leadership in those states is counterproductive?\n\nWe didn't send anybody away at the convention. There also was no suspension of anybody, except that of Anambra and we had a genuine reason to do so. In Anambra, one of the three factional chairmen that invaded the party's office was suspended. In order to bring about unity, we needed to dissolve all of them. When we met with them, each faction got an equal number of representatives that formed the caretaker committee. So, one of the factional chairmen was suspended for not abiding by the party's peacemaking moves. The dissolution of the executives in those states was done to make the factions come together as one. This would enable us to hold fresh elections so that credible people would emerge as the party's authentic leaders.\n\nThere have been concerns over alleged plans to reduce the powers of the national chairman and make the board of trustees more powerful.\n\nSo far, I can categorically tell you that nothing was done to reduce the powers of the BoT. The powers of the BoT are still what it used to be. Absolutely nothing was done to make the party's national chairman lose his power. The BoT is an advisory body. I am a member of the BoT and we only advise. There was never a time when the BoT took an executive decision. So, the claim is unfounded.\n\nThe National Chairman of the Advanced Peoples Democratic Alliance, Shitu Kabiru, said Dr. Raymond Dokpesi, Dan Nwanyanwu, and Mainasara Ilo are being used by the PDP to break the party apart. What is the relationship between APDA and PDP?\n\nI don't even know who the chairman of APDA is. As a matter of fact, the promoter of APDA, as far as I know, has always been Dokpesi. He is the one that has been communicating with the PDP in terms of a possible alliance since they got registered. Before the defection, we told him (Dokpesi) that our only choice remains the PDP. They got registered and went their way. An alliance with them could be possible along the line, especially with other political parties we are in talks with. We are open to an alliance with any party that is positive. The All Progressives Congress is in power so they don't need an alliance. I don't know the internal politics of the party. I am not in a position to talk about the internal wrangling there. In politics, sometimes, it is one leg in and one leg out until some politicians are sure where the pendulum is swinging. Some people were not so confident that the PDP would win at the Supreme Court in the way we did. Many were apprehensive. Dokpesi and others would be welcomed back to the PDP.\n\nWhat are you doing to ensure Sen. Ali Modu Sheriff remains in the PDP?\n\nIt is not up to us for him to remain here. It is his choice. Many people, who are his supporters, were at the convention. They participated in various committees at the convention. Individuals will make their personal decision.\n\nHave you talked to him after the Supreme Court judgment?\n\nNo. I am sorry, I have not. There is actually a committee on reconciliation. I don't want to do the committee's job.\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan came under fire for admitting that his administration did not plug all loopholes in tackling corruption?\n\nHe accepted (the reason) why we went wrong and (the areas) where we had deficiencies. Anybody that does not accept his faults is not ready to succeed. That is what is exactly wrong with the APC. They claim to be right in everything they do, while their personal faults are attributed to others. We are all humans and fallible.\n\nGovernor Ayodele Fayose launched his presidential bid at the convention. What do you have to say about this?\n\nThere were many people at the convention who indicated their political interests at the convention. It was not only Fayose. There were two other former governors who had posters about their bids. The convention was not elective and has nothing to do with the endorsement of anybody. There were also posters of those eyeing governorship and other positions. Would you say they were also endorsed? A convention is like a merrymaking ground where supporters come in to show their support.\n\nBut Fayose seems to enjoy the support of the BoT, despite the zoning structure.\n\nI don't know how people come up with such ambivalent claims and I can't comment on an individual's ambition. Be that as it may, the party has not changed its zoning structure. When we attend our elective convention in four months' time, the party's chairman will emerge from the southern part of the country. When the time to elect our presidential candidate comes, someone from the North will emerge. This has not been upturned. The story that the zoning structure would be jettisoned is not true. That is the position of the party. It does not stop any individual from other parts of the country, like Fayose, from indicating his interest. It is open but the decision of the party is zoning and I believe the contestants will respect that position. I will be surprised if people will say that they are not aware of this zoning. Everybody is aware of zoning. That is why you will not see anybody from the North seeking to be the chairman of the party. That is the decision of the convention and the Supreme Court has ruled that the decision of the convention is supreme. So, only a convention can reverse the zoning issue; that was not discussed at the last convention and I don't see it being changed. There is no going back on zoning.\n\nWhat is your take on the notice to quit issued to southerners and the anti-Igbo song in the North?\n\nFirst of all, the temperature of agitations now is far better than what it was at the beginning. It does not mean that we are not going to find a few loose cannons here and there -- in different parts of the country. What we must commend nationally is that people have woken up to their responsibility. I am assessing the scenario from a national perspective. I think the issue will calm down sooner than later. Anybody could have created the anti-Igbo song just to cause upheaval but the song is not a collective decision of the North.\n\nBut the Ohanaeze Ndigbo accused the northern elders and governors of not doing enough to calm the northern youths.\n\nRemember that the same accusation has been made against Ohanaeze in allowing Nnamdi Kanu to go unchecked for so long. It was Kanu's actions that made the northern youths to speak up. It should not be a blame game. We need to work together to stop these unwholesome agitations all across the country wherever they may be happening.\n\nWhat are the plans to woo former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Senate President Bukola Saraki, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Sen. Rabiu Kwankwaso and a host of others to join the PDP?\n\nThere is a plan to mobilise many people. We inaugurated the peace committee at the national and zonal levels and we have given them terms of reference to their work in terms of reconciliation and mobilisation. We hope they succeed in wooing these people back to the PDP.\n\nWith the zoning of the presidency to the North, there is a report that you are being seriously considered as the PDP's presidential candidate in 2019.\n\nI don't know where that report came from. I can sincerely tell you that I am not thinking about contesting at the moment. I am engrossed with my current task to rebuild the party, so I am not dividing my attention.\n\nWhat if the BoT urges you to run for president?\n\nWhether I am contesting or not is not the issue. The time for that has not come and I am not thinking of that at the moment.\n\nYou recently said the PDP made a mistake in fielding former President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015. What is being done to correct this in 2019?\n\nDefinitely, we had challenges in the choice of candidate but that was not the only issue. We (PDP) could have even won the election with Jonathan if our campaign methodology was different. The strategy we adopted alienated a large part of the country but then we have learnt from that mistake. A number of factors contributed to our defeat in 2015; it was not only the issue of the candidate but quite a number of (other) factors. This time, the PDP will field a strong candidate from the North to face (President Muhammadu) Buhari or whoever the APC presents. Buhari must go in 2019. I honestly don't see him winning a second term because we have concluded plans to defeat the APC in 2019. I believe the PDP will win that presidential election once we field a good candidate.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In this interview with ONYEDIKA AGBEDO, he says such threats are constant in political engagement, describing them as empty boasts. He also speaks on the persistent call for restructuring the country and the rise in separatist agitations, warning those fanning the embers of disunity in the country that \"they are playing with fire.\" Okechukwu also bares his mind on several burning issues in the polity. Excerpts:\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is seriously rebuilding from every indication and threatened to sack your party from Aso Rock in 2019 at its non-elective convention held in Abuja last week. What is your reaction to that?\n\nI am one of those who were happy with the Supreme Court judgment, which endorsed the Senator Ahmed Makarfi faction of the PDP. The faction's endowment falls into one of the core ingredients of multi-party system in liberal democracy, a scenario where two political parties dominate. It shows that our democracy is coming of age. The judgment is a victory for democracy and has set the stage for the electorate to choose between APC and PDP.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that our fledgling democracy requires a strong political party to square up with our great party, the APC, in 2019 general elections and beyond.\n\nOn their threat, it is normal in our system; it gives hope to the people and puts the incumbent on toes. Challenge is the name and we are used to it; we don't want a one party state, for no matter how benevolent you are, Lord Acton in his timeless statement said that power corrupts and that absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\nPresident Buhari and Acting President Osinbajo have done well that deserve another term.\n\nSo, their threat to sack APC-led Federal Government and win more states does not bother you?\n\nThreat is constant in political engagement especially for a political party, which hallucinated serially years back of ruling Nigeria for 60 years uninterrupted. One can understand the beating of chest and empty boast of the PDP. It is sound without fury; their assumption is that Nigerians have very short and transient memory that our people will forget how the PDP wrecked our lives because of sheer greed, lack of planning and squandermania. Methinks that Jonathan and his cohorts assume that many of us will easily forget how on May 13, 2010, his regime announced publicly with joy the award of $23 billion contract for the erection of three Greenfield refineries, one in Bayelsa, one in Kogi and one in Lagos. Today, neither did we see the refineries nor the billions of dollars and Nigeria's Excess Crude Accounts hovered around $17 billion then. The refineries could have saved Nigeria over $200 billion expended on importation of refined petroleum products till date. I shall come back to the tragedy of PDP's 16 years misrule and misgovernace as we speak on.\n\nThere has been obvious inactivity in you party and even the Senate President came out recently to urge focus on the part of the leadership. Don't you see the lull within your fold working against the interest of the party in future elections?\n\nThere is no lull in APC because I'm aware of party activities nationwide. We are in government at the centre and more states than any other political party, so you don't expect us to shout. We are expected to work more because to whom much is given much is expected. Remember that every election is a referendum on the incumbent.\n\nAs I said, the only thing is that we are more preoccupied with how best to pick the pieces and fix the country battered by soulless looters who ran a nebulous economic policy, which produced the richest African and the greatest number of poor people in the continent. Can you locate the large scale inequality which PDP bequeathed on our people in the midst of unprecedented oil and gas revenue and abundant human and mineral resources? PDP didn't share the prosperity to the people; it classified the country into super rich and super poor. This is the root cause of insecurity, poverty, gross unemployment and other ills of our dear country.\n\nWhen President Muhammadu Buhari came to power on May 29, 2015, he was aware that PDP's trademark is corruption, but little did he or even pundits know that our national treasury was almost empty, that workers and pensioners were being owed for several months, obligations of the state to creditors left unattended to and both physical and social infrastructure on parlous and deficit state.\n\nThat's why I said the PDP ran a nebulous economic policy. A nebulous economic policy is one that doesn't in real terms suit the environment where it is superimposed or foisted. In the case of Nigeria, it negated the truism that we have a primitive economy and not a capitalist economy where it is more adaptable. One of its primary slogans is that the private sector will drive the economy. In other words, its focal point is that the public sector is lazy, clueless and corrupt; therefore it should give way to the instruments of the capitalist mode of production. It was foisted on us specifically during the Structural Adjustment Programme. The irony is that since 1986 when it was foisted or hoisted on us, a cursory analysis shows that more Nigerians have gone under the poverty line, more jobless and in a situation of uncertainty.\n\nBut two and a half years down the line, why has the APC been unable to alter the status quo and fix the country as promised?\n\nIt is said that Rome, as beautiful as it is, was not built in one day, especially when as I said before the PDP deliberately looted our commonwealth. They left almost an empty treasury; they emptied the Excess Crude Account, which had $17 billion balance on May 6, 2010, when ex-president, Dr Goodluck Jonathan assumed office. For example, do you believe that PDP was unable for 16 good years, when oil sometimes sold for $145 per barrel, to complete any federal road? Please if find one federal road PDP completed, draw my attention, one needs to be contradicted. Is it Agege-Otta-Abeokuta, Lagos-Ibadan, Lagos-Benin, Maiduguri-Kano, Kano-Kaduna, Enugu-Port Harcourt, Enugu-Onitsha, Benin-Lokoja, Lokoja-Abuja to name but a few.\n\nThe Federal Government under the PDP played politics with the construction of the Second Niger Bridge for 16 years. Under former president Jonathan, the government awarded the construction of the bridge at the cost of N117 billion under a PPP arrangement with the government providing 30 per cent of the funds. Jonathan, who packaged the contract, never paid a dime in spite of unprecedented oil revenues and the fact that Ndigbo placed all their eggs in his basket. But Buhari has paid N14 billion so far as part of the Federal Government's contribution. These are some of the things those saying Buhari has done nothing in two years don't know. APC is committed to transforming this country, but it's a gradual process given what they met on ground.\n\nBut the APC too has virtually done nothing in two and a half years in office?\n\nThat is not true. Please don't allow yourself as a professional to be blinded by the cacophony of propaganda being banded by the PDP. Take a look at the record of government's oil earning from 2010 to date: Jonathan era -- 2010 - $70.7 billion; 2011 - $100.1 billion; 2012 - $96.9 billion; 2013 - $86.9 billion; 2014 - $77.9 billion; 2015 - $21 billion (Jan-May); compared to Buhari era: 2015 (June-Dec) - $16 billion; 2016 - $26 billion; 2017 (Jan-July) - $16 billion. The information is sourced from OPEC Revenue Data Sheet so it's verifiable. Bear this record in mind and do an assessment of what APC did with meager revenue and what PDP did with humongous revenue. With little, we did more jobs and returned construction workers back to job. This is the height of demonstration of continuity in governance. Let me tell one story; there was a day we had a meeting with President Buhari early in the regime and we asked him what's next when months down the line he had not appointed ministers and major functionaries. He quipped and took time to tell us how over 20 states owed workers and pensioners, from three months to 18 months; he ended up saying that it bled his heart. I was one of those who told him to use the scant resources he inherited to construct roads and other deficit infrastructure, as the number of civil servants among federal, state and local councils do not make up to more than 10 to 20 per cent of our population. We had reasoned that construction of roads would earn more political capital. But he hissed and told us that it is not only the 10 or 20 per cent civil servants that the bailout fund would service. He asked what of the tailors, the provision store traders, the carpenters and other neighbours being owed by the unpaid civil servants and pensioners. On pensioners, he told us that if he does not take care of pensioners, his war against corruption would be in vain. This was unlike PDP that squandered billions of pension funds. He has since then doled out billions of naira on bailout funds and Paris Club refund. A self-serving president could have abandoned the workers and pensioners, but that's not for a pro-people Buhari.\n\nPresident Buhari's illness has no doubt taken a toll on the leadership/cohesion of your party and the country as a whole. Does that not justify the ongoing protests for his return or resignation?\n\nWhat I know fully well at 62 years on this earth is that most adults, both male and female, are all carrying one or two packets of drug in their pockets. So, man is by nature prone to illness and it takes its own toll. Accordingly, I agree with you. The Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is doing well; yes, he is doing well. But if our dear President was on his feet, there is no way the National Assembly will be sitting on the $30 billion loan approval request for over one year. The loans were procured because of the trust the international community has on Buhari, yet some patriots are sitting on it.\n\nWhat has the loan got to do with his illness?\n\nCourtesy of Her Excellency, Aisha Buhari, wife of Mr President, if the lion was in the house, the loans could have been long approved. It demonstrates the lack of urgency on the part of the National Assembly. After all the trillion Naira squandered on power supply by the PDP, we are still below 4,000MW, yet there is a loan of $4.8 billion for Mambilla Hyde-Power Plant, low hanging fruit, which can generate 3,000MW but our dear compatriots are playing toy with it. Buhari could have fought hard to get the National Assembly to do the needful. That's the greatest downside of Mr President's absence.\n\nWhat impact has the illness of the President had on the cohesion of your party? I understand there is crisis in your state, Enugu, and many others?\n\nThe crisis in some state chapters of our great party, especially in Enugu State, reminds me of my days in the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in Enugu State. I was the governorship candidate and we had few members and there was little or no serious faction. Therefore, Buhari's illness has nothing to do with the party; one, he is not a party apparatchik; secondly, the sage says that when the number of people in the market increases there is bound to be more noise. In political science, it is said that people are like moths, they migrate to wherever there is light because moths survive only under hot circuit. The mass exodus from PDP to APC nationwide is unimaginable and quiet encouraging. We will prevail at the end.\n\nThe harassment of the anti-Buhari protesters by the Police recently drew the ire of many Nigerians who felt that the country was sliding into dictatorship. The explanation given by the police was that miscreants had hijacked the protest. But couldn't the police have separated the miscreants from the genuine non-violent protesters instead of descending on all of them together. Is the country really not losing the democratic gains of past PDP administrations under this present government?\n\nMethinks the Police has heeded to the outrage of the people as demonstrated by the civil handling of the unnecessary entry into Wuse market by Charly Boy and his cohorts. Let nobody celebrate the illness of Mr President, as all of us are prone to one ailment or the other.\n\nBut the President has been hosting visitors in London and that has given rise to speculations that he would soon return home but that is not happening. For how long would Nigerians continue to wait? Besides, don't you think that Nigerians really deserve to know what has been wrong with the President's health all these while? Recall that even the President himself demanded same in late president Umaru Yar'Adua's case?\n\nThe President has done the needful as prescribed by the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. And most importantly, he said he would abide by the orders of his doctors. Is it not better we rely on his doctors who are professionals?\n\nOn the issue of Buhari said this or that during ex-president Yar'Adua's ailment, I challenge anybody to publish where Buhari said Yar'Adua should resign or anything of that sort. Propaganda must have boundaries. Freedom of speech and indeed all the five freedoms have a cliff limit; so, Buhari is not the talking type.\n\nThe rejection of the Devolution of Powers Bill in the National Assembly has heightened separatist agitations in the country given the recent threat by a Yoruba group, the Yoruba Liberation Movement, to declare Oduduwa Republic. Also, a group of Niger Delta militants, the Adaka Boro Avengers recently said they would declare a Niger Delta Republic on October 1, this year. This is in addition to the persistent quest for Biafra by IPOB and MASSOB. What do you make of the entire situation?\n\nThe whole agitation is better analysed dispassionately in the interest of our beloved country. One, why now should be the first question. The second question should be, is APC against restructuring or why didn't PDP in its 16 years in power restructure the country.\n\nTo start with, the leadership of the APC is not opposed to restructuring otherwise you wouldn't find it in the constitution of the APC. All we are saying is let us first restructure the deficit infrastructure we inherited from PDP's misrule. Is it not better we fix electricity, roads, railways and other physical and social infrastructure before we go into the second phase. This is what I term restructuring the sub-structure before the super-structure. Then, we return to the valid question why now. The PDP and their co-protagonists of super-structure restructuring are less than patriotic in their agitation, otherwise why didn't they restructure Nigeria in their 16 golden years? Rather, what ex-president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo devoted his energy in his second term in office was the infamous Third Term agenda. His 2005 constitutional conference like Abacha and Jonathan's constitutional conferences rejected regionalism, one of their pet items. The agitation is more or less to divert the attention of Nigerians from further probe of their sordid years.\n\nImagine the negative reactions one received when I gave an innocent answer on Jonathan's era recently thus: \"My own sincere assessment is that our dear ex-president, His Excellency Dr Goodluck Jonathan rather than plug loopholes of corruption, opened it wide. He should apologise to Nigerians whom he betrayed for being less than transparent. I was outraged when I heard him proclaim that PDP will return to power in 2019 because of the hunger and poverty ravaging the country.\" I was greeted with tantrums of different hues.\n\nSome people have predicted that the country would break up if not restructured before the end of this year. Do you see that happening?\n\nWhich country? Nigeria? No way! My only appeal is to the National Assembly to approve the $30 billion loan request so as to return our youths to work. Imagine millions that will be directly and indirectly employed if the Coastal Railways, Mambilla, Enugu, Kano and other water and agricultural schemes commence. This is why I opine that those blocking the loans either don't sense the palpable danger hunger and poverty pose to the survival of our dear country or they just do not want Buhari to shine and succeed. The easiest time to restructure the super-structure is when the people are happy and there is shared prosperity. History of fault lines of ethnicity and skewed development indices can be fingered in the opposition to devolution of power and other tentacles of the yet to be defined super-structure restructuring. I stand to be corrected.\n\nIPOB and MASSOB have continued to call for the return of Igbos living in northern parts of the country following the debut of an anti-Igbo song amid reconciliation moves by the Federal Government after the earlier quit notice to Igbos to leave the North on or before October 1, this year, by a coalition of Arewa youths. Don't you think the situation is really getting out of hand?\n\nWhereas they are entitled to freedom of expression and the other five freedoms, they should not lose sight of the standard beacons in self-determination, one of which is consultation. I have lived 28 years in the North; sooner or later one will spend more years in the North than in the South-east. Is it not fair to consult people like me in the North? Or you just bundle us direct to the East. Methinks we need to be consulted before some young brothers of ours will compel us to do so. They are playing with fire.\n\nThe November 18 Anambra gubernatorial election is fast approaching and Nnamdi Kanu has been boasting that the election will no hold unless a referendum is conducted to determine the fate of Igbos in Nigeria. How concerned are you about such threats given the success of the sit at home order issued by IPOB in May, this year?\n\nGive me a break, in the sense that Nnamdi Kanu seems to be missing his abode in detention, if not why is he stoking another arrest? I do not blame a young man who has no fixed address in England only to come here to be feted by our big brothers like Messers Soludo, Utomi, Chidioka, Agu and co. It is very easy to fan ethnic and religious hatred in this country today; any buffoon can harvest on the hunger and poverty PDP's misgovernace dropped on our table.\n\nWhat are the chances of your party in the election given the strong anti-APC/Buhari stand in the South-east coupled with the power of incumbency factor, which will definitely benefit Governor Willie Obiano?\n\nDefinitely we shall prevail. I'm happy to say that my sojourn for over 12 years with Buhari has taught me useful lessons one couldn't pick in the political science class. When the late Oyi of Oyi, Dr Chuba Okadigbo of blessed memory told us that Buhari is the only Nigerian who can stop the one party state then being brewed by Obasanjo, he gave a caveat that it is going to be a marathon race, as PDP would do all to stop Buhari. Oyi did not live to learn, as we did, that no one ethnic group or religious group in the country can win the presidency without other groups. Buhari didn't win in 2003, 2007 and 2011; minus the PDP rigging machine is the fact that he couldn't win any of the three geopolitical zones in the South, except in 2015. I am convinced that with all the projects going on across the country and the ones en route, we shall win in Anambra.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:38:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2528,

Political commentators have attributed this to the prolonged national leadership tussle and his resilience to rescue the party from the Ali Modu-Sheriff-led National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nObservers say that the umbrella party has a history of coming out stronger after major conflicts.\n\nFor instance, in 2001, the party survived a major crisis, which saw the expulsion of some founding fathers including Sunday Awoniyi, Don Etiebet, Asheik Jarma, Bamanga Tukur, Edwin Ume-Ezeoke. All members of the party's Board of Trustees had battled with the then president, Olusegun Obasanjo, for the soul of the party.\n\nIn 2006, it survived another crisis instigated by its pioneer National Chairman, Solomon Lar, and a former Deputy National Chairman, Shuaibu Oyedokun, both of whom floated a parallel NWC.\n\nIn 2013, the PDP again was thrown into crisis when some of its prominent members including ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Kwara State Governor and current Senate President Bukola Saraki alongside five former PDP governors: namely Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso (Kano); Aliyu Wammako (Sokoto); Abdulfatah Ahmed (Kwara); Rotimi Amaechi (Rivers) and Murtala Nyako (Adamawa) revolted and floated a new faction of the party, named nPDP. They later defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nOn July 12, 2017, the Supreme Court declared Makarfi as the authentic leader of party, after a 14-month leadership crisis that almost tore its foundation.\n\nTotal reconciliation of aggrieved members is urgently needed ahead of the 2019 general election, which is exactly 544 days away.\n\nAlso, there are four polls in quick succession in the next few months, which the party should take advantage of. They include: Dukku North State Constituency bye-election in Gombe State, bye-election in Eti Osa I State Constituency in Lagos State; Kware/Wamakko Federal Constituency in Sokoto State and the end of off season gubernatorial election in Anambra State scheduled for November 18.\n\nWith the extension of the tenure of the caretaker committee by four months, the first major task before it is the conduct of an elective national convention, where party members will be elected to fill various elective positions in the party.\n\nAlready, the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC), the second highest decision making organ of the party, had adopted the report of the Post-Election Review Committee, chaired by Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, which zoned the position of National Chairman of the party to the South.\n\nAs controversy mounts over the micro-zoning of the position to the South-West geopolitical zone, thereby shutting out other aspirants from the South-East and South-South, analysts say the Makarfi-led committee must distance itself from the issue, avoid imposition of candidates by giving all aspirants contesting various party offices a level-playing field.\n\n\"The party must now move on from the euphoria that greeted the non-elective convention to face the challenges ahead. The task ahead is bigger than the challenges they just surmounted. The party must learn from the past by leaving behind the toga of imposition of candidates,\" an Abuja-based legal practitioner, Donald Ibeh, told BDSUNDAY.\n\nAhead of the National Convention slated for the end of the year, another issue the Makarfi-led NCC must not handle with kid's glove is the reconciliation of the party's feuding members. The 14-month old legal tussle resulted in bad blood between factions loyal to Sheriff and Makarfi. With the inauguration of reconciliation committee co-chaired by Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike and his Gombe State counterpart, Ibrahim Dankwambo, the task before the committee is to unite all members under one umbrella. In his famous speech on June 16, 1858 at the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, after he accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination as the state's senator, former US President Abraham Lincoln noted that \"A house divided against itself cannot stand\".\n\nThe party must also handle carefully the inauguration of caretaker committees in some state chapters to reflect the wishes of its members in the affected states.\n\nRecall that the leadership crisis had resulted in the inauguration of parallel executives and inconclusive congresses in Lagos, Adamawa, Borno, Osun, Ogun, Kebbi, Anambra and Kwara States. However, as a first step towards resolving the impasse, the Convention dissolved all executive committees at all levels in the affected states and mandated the NCC to constitute caretaker committees in their stead, pending the conduct of proper state congresses.\n\nOf the eight affected states, only that of Anambra State had been constituted so far, apparently because of the coming election in the state.\n\nAs the euphoria over the party's victory in Osun West Senatorial District Bye-Election dies down, observers say the forthcoming gubernatorial election in Anambra State will provide a litmus test for the party's readiness for the 2019 general election.\n\nThe issue of imposition of candidates, which had been the bane of major conflict in the state, may rear its ugly head in Anambra State if not properly handled by the national leadership of the party. Last week, a group of protesters thronged the national secretariat of the party, alleging attempts by a former governor of the state to impose one of the seven gubernatorial aspirants on the party. To this end, the conduct of the August 26Anambra PDP governorship primary must not only be fair, but must be seen to be fair.\n\n'Democracy' they say, 'is a game of numbers'. In this part of the world, one of the best ways to attract influx of supporters to a political party is the number of prominent individuals who have endorsed the party.\n\nThis is why the party is making frantic efforts to ensure the return of all former high ranking government officials who held top political office under the party as well as founding fathers of the party under the aegis of Group of 34 members.\n\nIn the build-up to 2015 general election, former Olusegun Obasanjo had monitored the shredding of his PDP membership card and much later declared his resignation from partisan politics.\n\nAlso, ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Kwara State Governor and Senate President Bukola Saraki alongside five former PDP governors: namely Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso (Kano); Aliyu Wammako (Sokoto); Abdulfatah Ahmed (Kwara); Rotimi Amaechi (Rivers) and Murtala Nyako (Adamawa) had defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC), even as former Speaker of the House of Representatives and now governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, led members from the lower chamber into the APC.\n\nWhile high profile political office holders are asking for automatic return tickets as a condition for defecting to the party, PDP members who weathered the storm throughout the 14-month old crisis are insisting that the new members should queue.\n\nHerein lies the challenge for the party: rewarding loyalty or granting automatic tickets to political heavyweights. Its loss at the 2015 general election was attributed to impunity when it imposed former President Goodluck Jonathan against the wishes of some members.\n\nIt must also seek aggressive revenue drive by exploring other sources of funding as enshrined in the party's Constitution. These include subscription fees, membership fees as well as proceeds from investments. This will make it financially independent rather than rely on handouts from governors.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:55:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 15, "textStart": 0, "date": "2017-08-12",

It is set to alter 2019 political calculations drastically.\n\nSome of his rivals who were already dreaming of a post-Buhari era may now have to pull the break. The anxiety over his health may begin to fizzle out for now - casting uncertainty of the plans of many ambitious politicians.\n\nThe homecoming is cheery news for him, his family and political associates. But there are some puzzles: Is the president now fit to withstand the rigour of governance? Is he permanently or temporarily back? Is it another political game to convey the impression of wellness and blot the embarrassing picture of an 'on and off president'? Has he returned to spend few weeks and months before going back?\n\nThe president's return may alter the calculations of presidential aspirants in the ruling and opposition parties. The dream of a vacancy in Aso Villa may become blurred. If the ambitious politicians, particularly in the ruling party, still carry on their activities, it will be in utter sensitivity to the fact that the president in back. It would appear that the coast is not clear yet. Buhari's body language will henceforth, moderate political activities, ahead of 2019. At party level, he may plead with or compel party chieftains to stop distracting him with their antagonistic aspirations.\n\nAlready, some of the aspirants are making moves. Some are overtly campaigning on the borrowed platform of restructuring. The national question is being raised on the altar of partisanship to spite the leader who has not demonstrated commitment in that direction. Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, Kaduna State Governor Nasir el-Rufai are reportedly putting their thinking caps. Recently, there were reports in the media that the Turakin Adamawa had opened discussions with PDP elements in the National Assembly, in furtherance of his 2019 ambition. The veteran presidential aspirant is setting up structures and building new bridges. Also, it was reported that the supporters of the former Kano State governor have returned to the PDP to prepare the ground for his imminent defection. How will the president handle these scenarios?\n\nWill he take a bow or re-contest in 2019? Time will tell. Buhari is constitutionally entitled to a second term. If he throws his hat in the ring, will the party rally round him? How united and formidable is the ruling party? The president's influence may not have waned in the North. His support base may not be shrinking. It appears he remains popular in the region among the masses.\n\nTo these fanatical supporters, the feeling of vacancy in 2019 may be imaginary. Ultimately, it may be the undoing of the ambitious. Obviously, the North cannot on its own install a president for all Nigeria. Depending on the candidate the PDP will put forward, and the circumstances that may unfold as the gladiators warm up for 2019, it may not be difficult for the president to reactivate his partisan friendship with the Southwest progressive leaders for the purpose of re-election.\n\nIf the president does not re-contest, what next? If he steps down, the feeling is that the next APC presidential candidate will still come from the North, more so when the PDP has zoned its presidential ticket to the region. That means that the North will hold the Presidency for the 12 years.\n\nWho among the APC aspirants will the president back if he decides not to run? Does Buhari have a succession plan? Who will emerge as the beneficiary of the plan? Who will he anoint? Will his preferred candidate be acceptable to the generality of the party?\n\nWhether he will re-contest or not, Buhari will have to pay attention to his party. The edifice is cracking and creaking. Many observers have predicted that, unless concrete steps are taken, the platform will crumble. The leaders of the APC are not united by ideology. Their primary focus ahead of 2015 was how to displace Dr. Goodluck Jonathan's PDP and capture power.\n\nBut having clinched power, things stated to fall apart. For the centre to hold, the president should act fast. To stem defections, he must broker reconciliation among the divided blocs and centres of influence in the APC. Leaders across the six geo-political zones who worked for the president's victory at the poll, but who now feel that they are being sidelined, should be pacified and brought into confidence.\n\nThe final critical step is for the president to liberate himself from the cabals. The APC needs a strong crisis resolution mechanism. A united ruling party is in the interest of his Presidency.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:42:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.572549045085907, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374930", "time": "03:42:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374930", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "164", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "74902", "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_State", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "74906", "label": {"eng": "Kaduna State"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaduna_State", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kaduna State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "306093", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Muhammadu Buhari"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari", "score": 5}, {"id": "306095", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Goodluck Jonathan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodluck_Jonathan", "score": 1}, {"id": "329610", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rabiu Kwankwaso"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabiu_Kwankwaso", "score": 3}, {"id": "330992", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "score": 4}, {"id": "345740", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Atiku Abubakar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiku_Abubakar", "score": 3}, {"id": "431446", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fizzle (nuclear test)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizzle_(nuclear_test)", "score": 3}, {"id": "556480", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Ahmad_el-Rufai", "score": 3}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "03:42:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Politics Of Buhari's Return", "originalArticle": null}

Group Politics Editor, TAIWO ADISA, who was on the panel, presents the excerpts:\n\nIT has been said that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration inherited serious challenges in the political, economic and governance spheres. Two years on, it will be nice to start and ask you what is your assessment of the administration, in spite of the challenges it inherited?\n\nI think if we take on board all the difficulties that we have encountered in the last two years and the state of the economy, I believe very strongly that the government has done very well. The APC government at the centre has done very well. The APC governments across the 24 states of the federation have done very well. The work is not done. The work of government is not done in two years, which means that there is still a lot to achieve and as long as there are still real issues of difficulties that citizens are experiencing, then our work is not done. But we are working at it. Our governments are working at it day and night and I believe that significant progress has been made in various sectors.\n\nLet's look at the Boko Haram insurgency. Recently, the Acting President had to give another order to the Chief of Defence Staff and the Service Chiefs to go back to the theatre of operation. How do you see that and the relapse. Is it because they were not in that area or rather they left the area initially that there was a resurgence of insurgency?\n\nI think we sometimes maybe tend to underestimate the nature of the challenges that we face with the Boko Haram insurgency and it's the same with all terrorist activities world over. When the issue happened in University of Maiduguri where some of the lecturers were abducted and all of that, the opposition PDP said APC has celebrated too soon; that the victory we declared over Boko Haram was a propaganda. My own interpretation is that the victory that we've celebrated is not propaganda. It is real. What happened recently is what you call resurgence which I think only demonstrates the resilience of the kind of challenge we are dealing with. Al-Queda happened in 2000, 2001.But how many years did it take before Bin Laden was killed? And up till this day, the problem is still there. That is to tell you that the nature of the problem we are dealing with is not a sprint. It's a marathon.\n\nBut be that as it may, it's important for us not forget that any country's claim to nationhood is its capacity to preserve its territorial integrity. Boko Haram successfully violated Nigeria's territorial integrity in 2014, going to 2015. At a point, more than 50,000 square kilometers of Nigeria's territory was effectively in the hands of Boko Haram. They had their flags planted on Nigeria's soil and declared Boko Haram caliphate.\n\nToday under the APC government, what is the size of the Nigerian territory in the hands of Boko Haram? Zero. So, Boko Haram is still able to carry out some of these sporadic hit-and-run attacks, but they are no longer capable of holding territories within the Nigerian space and that is a major victory that everyone has to acknowledge.\n\nAt the point that this government was coming on board, how many Chibok girls were kidnapped, how many of the Chibok girls have been rescued? Today we are talking about how is left to be rescued, not how many has been rescued. That is an achievement that we are proud of. Some people say government bribed Boko Haram, government paid Boko Haram. Whether government bribed Boko Haram or whatever, the point is that people's children have been returned to their parents. That is quite significant. So, for us, the progress that the Buhari Administration, the APC government has made in curtailing Boko Haram insurgency is quite significant and it's an achievement we are very proud of.\n\nThe battle is not won and that is why the Acting President has said you (military chiefs) have to go back and pay more attention to this. That also means that we are aware that the battle is not over.\n\nI believe so. Why will I say that? You see, sometimes, the fight against corruption is at various levels. But I believe that the fundamental fight that needs to happen is our heads, more than any other thing. Why do I say so? A couple of years ago, before APC came into power, nobody was talking about corruption. It's like it has been normalized, why because everybody was the game. So there is nothing abnormal about it anymore. The level of impunity - we didn't realise it at the time. But now the revelations are coming forward. I read in the newspapers that one Minister forfeited a house of $37 million and the level of recovery that has been made from people who were supposed to protect this country, the military and all that, we didn't know that it was happening. So, today, the most important achievement that I will say in the war against corruption is that every single day you wake up in this country, people are talking about corruption, which means that Nigerians have not accepted it as a way of life. You open the newspapers, you turn the radio, you look at the television, people are having conversations. So, the fact that we have rejected it as a way of life is significant.\n\nSo, what APC government has done more than any other government you can talk about, whether in terms of loot recovery, in terms of prosecution, is that we have escalated conversation about corruption to the centre stage and that is quite significant.\n\nSome people are still saying the fight against corruption is targeted at the opposition?\n\nIt's natural. If I don't have access to the kitchen, you can't accuse me of stealing the meat from the pot. If the opposition party was in government for the period that they had been in government and you are looking at things that happened during that period, it's natural that it is people on that side that will be affected. Four years down the line, eight years down the line or how long it takes, if another political party comes into power and they want to look at this period, it's what people like us have done in this period that they will be looking at. So, it's only natural.\n\nI think if you want to confuse a situation, you say it's targeted at opposition. But what I keep saying is can anybody point at one person who is being prosecuted for corruption but simply because that person has joined APC, that case has been dropped? If you are able to find one example, then we begin to pay attention to that kind of argument.\n\nDuring the 2015 electioneering campaign, one of the agenda of the party was devolution of powers. Now, a lot of people interpret devolution of powers to mean the same thing with restructuring or as an element of restructuring. Is it that you were not clear with what you meant by devolution of powers in your party's agenda?\n\nWe are clear with what we mean by restructuring. In fact, I think one significant thing that will distinguish APC from other political parties is the position we have taken on the issue restructuring, what you call true federalism or devolution as you want to call it. If you take that out of our party, then you have a different kind of political party. That's what we believe in and what we stand for.\n\nBut if you look at our manifesto, the issue related to restructuring or true federalism as you call it, appear only in three places. If you put together, they are not more than five, six lines. Now, what that means is that it is therefore subjected to definition, to interpretation. We now need to articulate it into a body of principles that are also implementable and that is why we have set up a committee to do that.\n\nNow, people keep asking, what does APC's notion of federalism or restructuring mean. I start by saying what it does not mean. Since this conversation about restructuring started, people have been giving it different meanings. There are some people who's definition of restructuring is regionalisation; that instead of the current 36 states structure, let's have six regions. That's some people's definition of restructuring. But that is not APC's notion of restructuring. Some people are even saying let's have loose unions with a weak centre. That's not APC's notion of restructuring. APC's notion of restructuring is anchored on one principle, which is devolution of powers. There are 68 items currently on the Exclusive Legislative List. APC's notion of restructuring is taking some of these items from the exclusive list and transferring them to the concurrent list, so that the lower tiers of government - the state and the Local Government can legislate on those that are currently exclusive preserve of the Federal Government.\n\nSo, the idea is restructuring governance and bringing governance closer to the people, so that the people can feel it and achieve more results. Of course, in consonance with that or corresponding when you take those responsibilities and give some of them to the States and some to the local governments, it also means that the resources will follow and that's where you say you cannot have devolution without talking about fiscal federalism. It means that most of the resources kept at the centre at the moment will go to the states, whether you talk of state policing, whether you talk of control of local prisons and what not. So, that is APC's notion of restructuring.\n\nAny kind of restructuring that will require redrawing the maps of Nigeria, that is not what APC promised, without prejudice to those who think that is what should happen. But I think the conversation about the kind of federalism we should have or the kind of federal structure should have is not going to end now.\n\nSince the beginning of this administration, people have seen less interaction between the party and the National Assembly. The caucus actually, I remember it's only once that the Chairman had met with the House and the Senate caucus. Why is there silence between the party and the caucus?\n\nIt's only once that the party leadership the Senate and the House caucus have met openly to the knowledge of the general public. But they are constantly meeting and we are constantly having conversations about various issues. I agree with you that maybe we could have closer interactions than we've had. It started with the Governors. Now we have regular monthly meeting with APC Governors. When they come for Economic Council meeting, they come to the party and we all meet. We have expanded that and the leadership of the National Assembly will also be part of that meeting. We are having regular monthly meetings now.\n\nStill talking about meetings, the APC top leadership is being accused of being reluctant of calling National Executive Committee meeting and also the Board of Trustees which is affecting the running of the party. What do you say about that?\n\nWe have challenges I must say. Nobody envisaged that it will take this long to put all these in place. No matter how we try to look at it, we have real issues. Initially, it was issue of funding. Don't forget President Buhari said he was not going to use government money to fund the party. So, initially it was the challenge of funding. How do we raise money? Running of party is expensive. How are we going to raise money to organise all these meetings? We have to rely on membership dues. It's easy with the National Assembly because we can capture them and say bring your membership dues. You can capture the Ministers and say bring your membership dues. But for members across the country, it's more difficult harvesting these dues. So, that's been the challenge but then we've made progress. Then the President's health situation happened. We have to be sensitive to that. We can't be holding national rallies when our President, the leader of the party is in the situation that he's in. But we are glad that he's recovering and hopefully will come back soon.\n\nBut you can see we've started the process. About two Saturdays ago, we did the state congresses to fill vacant positions at various levels. That's the journey that we've started that we believe will ultimately lead us to our national convention The congresses we had across the states were non-elective congresses. They were mainly to replace those who were holding party positions and who died, those who took appointments or those who left the party, to fill those vacant positions. Then it's also to elect three delegates per local government that will come to the non-elective convention when the date is fixed.\n\nThe congresses have raised some dusts in some states like Kaduna and some other states. What is the party doing to calm down the tension?\n\nWe will deal with these issues. But it is politics. If it is politics, it has to be messy. So, all these issues will come up, but we will deal with them. But I know as journalists, we are more interested in where there are crisis. But out of 36 states, we have issues in a couple of States that are not even up to 5. So that is more than 85 per cent success. So, where there are issues, we will acknowledge these issues and we will deal with them.\n\nStill on the party, there are plans to review party primary system at some point and this we understand was to eliminate the impact of money in politics and in the emergence candidates. How far has APC gone in that?\n\nI know there is this electoral reform that was done. But more importantly at the party level, we have conducted our constitutional review committee chaired by the National Legal Adviser of the party. They have turned in their report and we are studying it now. So, when we have our NEC meeting and have our national convention, this will hopefully be one of the agenda that party will ratify. We will look at the constitutional amendment proposals that are made.\n\nBut the idea is not just about lessening the impact of money in party politics; that is quite significant. But it's also to see how we can achieve greater equity, greater representation, not only of people across the country but also gender. So, that's quite significant to us. We believe it's an opportunity to address some of these issues. It's still early, but we believe that by the time we approach the national convention, some of these issues would be very clear.\n\nHopefully soon. I cannot tell you a date but hopefully soon.\n\nApart from crisis related to the congresses, the party also has pockets of crises all across so many states, both in the South and the North. How are you handling those crises?\n\nLet me mention one, Kogi. We received a delegation from Kogi, those who are on the other side of the governor. Kogi has been a bit of a challenge for us and the reason it's been such a challenge is because both sides are maintaining a very hard line position. But we are hoping that with these conversations that we are having with them, we will make people see the need to soften their position and find a common ground.\n\nThe Committee we set up, chaired by former Minister of Information, Prince Tony Momoh, has turned in its report. We have looked at it and its part of what we are going to look into at the next NWC meeting. But Kogi has been a challenge for us and we believe very strongly that as long as we focus on it, we are going to get to the bottom of it. As I said, up till yesterday, the issue of Kogi was on our plate and I believe we will find a solution.\n\nYou also have to understand that some of these things can generate tensions and all that. But in politics, it is natural because when it comes to resource allocation, power allocation, who gets what after an election, there will be issues. When you are fighting for election, everybody will come together, you fight until you win or until you lose as the case may be. But when you win, that is when everybody is beginning to ask himself, 'so, what is in this for me.'\n\nIs it the allocation of positions that led to the crisis in Kaduna right now?\n\nMost possibly. We've also received delegation from Kaduna. The members of the National Assembly came in the aftermath of the congress that was held where there was a bit of disturbance there and some people were attacked and the party came out very strongly. Our position was very strong. We condemned the violence that attended that process and we said we will investigate and anyone that is found culpable will face the appropriate sanction.\n\nWe want to keep everybody in the party. But I wish it was easy saying you are right, you are wrong. When you are trying hard to keep everybody in the party, then it is difficult to apportion the kind of blame that either party will want you to allocate to their opponent. So, it takes longer to find solution to this problem. But I believe very strongly that we will find solution to them very soon.\n\nPDP the leading opposition party is coming from internal crisis after fourteen months. Do you feel threatened?\n\nNot at all. We are actually happy that PDP is coming back and we know that it's important for a democratic government to have a strong opposition. So, we are happy that PDP is overcoming its problems. So, we don't feel threatened. We only want PDP to play its part as an opposition that puts Nigeria first and we will play our part as government in power putting Nigeria first. I think that is it. But as long as continue to think that the responsibility they have as an opposition party is to continue to heckle government, to continue to undercut government where even government should be commended, then we will have duty to continue to remind Nigerians that that party played a role in leading us where we are today. But there is no point going back to the past.\n\nWhen you say it's the policy of APC to keep everybody together and not allow your members to go elsewhere, what do you make of some of your very notable members who are accusing APC now of lack of internal democracy.\n\nWell, unless I know what exactly they are complaining about, it's difficult for me to...\n\nTimi Frank, for example, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar and to a certain extent, I understand even the Senate President...\n\nI think they are different issues. I've not read the statement made by the former Vice President. He is definitely a senior member of our party. He must know what he is talking about. People like that don't just talk loosely. So, he must know what he is talking about. Timi Frank, as you know, his issues happened before I joined the party. I think he has issues with the executive of the party. So, he will continue say the kind of things he is saying.\n\nThe Senate President, I read this interview and it was a bit over interpreted. What the Senate President was said in the context of trying to defend himself. People accused him of wearing PDP underwear. They say we see you are in APC but your underwear appears to look more like an umbrella and he said I am APC body and spirit. But I understand why people can be saying this. It's because there is a lot of work that we need to do at the party level. I've told the chairman several times that we need to refocus the party and if we are meeting regularly and people are seeing us all the time meeting, then they won't be saying somebody's body is somewhere, his spirit is elsewhere. That's what he said.\n\nSo, interpretatively, he is saying the party chairman is not doing enough in terms of leadership.\n\nThat's what he is saying. He's saying we are not doing enough, that we need to do more than we are doing. But I think some our colleagues just said APC lacks focus.\n\nTalking about internal democracy, the Osun West Senatorial by-election, is a good example of what happened and APC lost the election, don't you think it's as a result of internal democracy issues?\n\nI agree with you that it was a very difficult issue for us. But I believe that it's also a learning process. We've learnt our lessons from what happened and we can only hope to do better next time.\n\nAt the beginning of this administration, we were used to hearing that APC was not ready for governance, PDP is not ready for opposition. More than two years now, are you really giving governance and looking at the other party, are they giving you the kind of opposition that you need in a democracy\n\nWell, I can only talk about what we are doing and what we need to do, some of which I've mentioned. When people say APC is not ready for governance, I don't know what exactly they mean. I think people are looking at some of the teething problems we had taking off and that's why they said we were are not ready for governance. But we must not forget that when you have a political party - look at what is happening in US now. How many months after Donald Trump has been elected President. How many of the Ministers that he wanted to appoint have been appointed? So, it is the nature of democracy. It is untidy. It is sluggish. But mankind has not been able to invent a better form of government.\n\nSo, I think when we had this issue with the National Assembly leadership, they said these people are not ready for government. But I've just called your attention to something. When President Obasanjo came in in 1999, how many party chairmen did PDP have within the first five years? How many Senate Presidents? How many Speakers? So, these are issues that parties will continue to grapple with. In our own case, it's more difficult because we are grappling with becoming a party in government; we are also grappling with the recession in the economy and peoples' expectations. Our manifesto was quite ambitious.

false, "body": "Marvel's The Defenders: all you need to know about superhero crew\n\nFour become one in The Defenders, the Netflix show that brings three Marvel heroes and a heroine - Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist - together for a new ensemble series.\n\nThe Defenders is based on the comic book series of the same name featuring superhero \"outsiders\", which debuted in the early 1970s. The new show sees the quartet come together to battle the crime syndicate known as The Hand, and features an additional villain in the form of Sigourney Weaver, who brings a brittle air of authority to the series.\n\nJoining forces for The Defenders, which debuts on Netflix on August 18, has always been on the cards for the four heroes. Each one already has their own individual character TV series running on Netflix, seemingly just to build up to their inclusion in The Defenders. But although fans always knew the big team-up was in the offing, how it would be achieved was a mystery.\n\nThe four shows are all part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - the fictional world that allows the studio's stories to overlap with continuity and logic - and major and minor characters are glimpsed in each one (or in the case of lovers Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, act together). But the storylines are very distinct, and the film styles are different for each.\n\nFor instance, Luke Cage is set in Harlem, and draws inspiration from the Blaxploitation genre of films from the 1970s. Iron Fist, meanwhile, is influenced by kung fu movies. To make the stories mesh, Marvel has taken a middle course for The Defenders, and created an alternate scenario which allows everyone to freely exist side-by-side. The characters, who are now well established in the minds of the viewers, make the transition to this slightly different reality pretty much intact.\n\n\"Some things happen in The Defenders that wouldn't happen in Daredevil, but even so, we didn't have to change the characters at all for the new show,\" says 34-year-old British actor Charlie Cox, who plays the blind superhero Daredevil, aka lawyer Matt Murdock.\n\n\"You can't change who you are. But the other characters in The Defenders bring out different sides of Daredevil, and that's nice. Matt starts to take himself less seriously, as the others make fun of him a bit, and he's able to see the funny side of that.\"\n\nThe heroes, who are all outsiders and loners, gain from the group experience, Cox adds. \"They see how they can benefit for having friends and being part of the group.\"\n\nAll the shows are set in New York, says 40-year-old Mike Colter - who plays the bulletproof Luke Cage - and this makes them relatively easy to fit together. Cage spends his time fighting crime in Harlem, and rarely heads outside his neighbourhood, so The Defenders gave him a chance to expand his personality.\n\n\"It did feel like a departure, as he was existing in a larger world,\" Colter says. \"Cage was in prison, and then came out and adapted to Harlem, which is a specific part of town. He still thinks the rest of New York City is a bit alien, so The Defenders is a different kind of experience for him.\"\n\nMost of the changes took place behind the scenes, says 35-year-old Krysten Ritter, who plays the hard-hitting private investigator (and former superhero) Jessica Jones.\n\n\"They worked with the colour palette and things like that, and we just slotted into it unchanged,\" she says. \"But I think there is a deeper psychological world in the individual shows - we don't see as much psychology in The Defenders.\"\n\nFinn Jones, the 29-year-old who plays the martial arts master Iron Fist, echoes this point. \"The Defenders is more frenetic, more of a celebration of our existence, than the individual shows. But it was still a seamless transition for me.\"\n\nThe characters are still the main focus in the new show, the cast say, noting that their weaknesses and insecurities are what appeal to viewers - and to the performers themselves. (Iron Fist was the only character from the miniseries to appear in the original Defenders comics, although the others share the outsider status of the originals.)\n\n\"What attracts me to the Marvel characters is that you are dealt a certain amount of capabilities, but you still have problems - and some of them come from the fact that you have these capabilities,\" Colter says. \"I have these super abilities but I'm not sure how to use them, how to integrate them into my lifestyle. That leads to problems.\"\n\nRitter's Jessica Jones is a very complex character for a superhero show. Jones suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\"When I was building the character of Jessica Jones in series one, I spent most of my time researching PTSD,\" Ritter says. \"When you have PTSD, it's more like you are reliving the trauma again, rather than having a flashback.\n\n\"It's good to bring PTSD out into the open with a character like Jessica, as it reduces the stigma of the disease. Many people have mental health issues, and some of the viewers connect better to Jessica because of what she's going through. We try to portray PTSD as accurately as possible in the show.\"\n\nFinn Jones says he sees his character of Iron Fist - aka business heir Danny Rand - as human first, superhero second, and looks to his own experiences growing up to inform his portrayal.\n\n\"I don't think of him as a martial arts superstar when I play him,\" he says. \"He can fight, but that's not the main thing about his character. Mainly he is going through a deep trauma, and he's trying to grow up.\n\n\"You have to forget about the superhero part to play him. That's when it becomes interesting and relatable.\"\n\nThe action is, of course, as important as the characterisation, and each series makes use of a dedicated fight director and stunt teams. The characters display a variety of different fighting styles, including wing chun, tae kwon do and Thai boxing, although the actors admit that they are not trained fighters. \"The action is highly choreographed, like a dance,\" Ritter says. \"We have stunt doubles, and they do a take, and then we do a take. Later, the editors get into it with their scissors and make it work.\"\n\nJessica Jones, however, is more a street fighter than a martial artist, Ritter says. \"Jessica is not trained in martial arts. I need to have a certain degree of psychological strength to get through it all, so I train at boxing when I have time. But Jessica herself is all brute force and strength, so I don't have to do the fancy moves.\"\n\nFinn Jones says he has become enamoured with martial arts during his time as Iron Fist. \"I had very little prep time going into Iron Fist, and I had very little prep time going into The Defenders. So the fight scenes were mainly choreography,\" he says.\n\n\"But now I am taking fighting classes, as I want to know how to throw a punch properly. At first, it was just about fighting for the cameras. Now I need to know how to fight for real, to get that idea into in my body, and to know the philosophy behind it. I want to know what it really feels like to take a punch.\"", "timeCrawl": "16:27:00", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 663, "date": "2017-08-18", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 672}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8940127", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "id": 712, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "id": 713, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Martial Arts", "id": 1413, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Schools_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Schools and Instruction", "id": 1620, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Well worth the wait, the new show is every bit the event that Marvel fans hoped it could be.\n\nThe coming together of the streaming service's four superhero shows -- each with varying styles on how to be a hero -- works in part because of how they focus on why such a get-together shouldn't work at all. The show premieres Aug. 18.\n\nBut before Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) team up to defend New York City, the producers of the show divide the four into pairs.\n\nMatt Murdock is still reeling from the pain of losing the woman he loved, Elektra (more on that later), and has left his Daredevil/vigilante days behind to focus on being the best lawyer possible. And who should end up needing a good, affordable attorney? Jessica Jones. (Jones is on the bad side of Misty Knight, played by Simone Missick. Could Misty have a future as a Defender, too?)\n\nMurdock and Jones butt heads from the start as they realize they're both investigating something that connects to an evil scheme too big for the both of them.\n\nThat something is Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra, who may be the biggest surprise of \"The Defenders.\" She's a compelling villain with a mysterious past that borders on the unbelievable - we can't say more than that without giving too much away.\n\nAlso on Alexandra's trail is Danny Rand, the Immortal Iron Fist, who realizes that she is connected to some of his father's company's previous shady financial dealings. Some of the grunt work of those deals is handled by young men in Harlem, which puts Luke Cage into the path of the Iron Fist. Literally: The two come to blows before Cage gets a chi-glowing fist to the jaw.\n\nThe Luke Cage/Iron Fist combo is where \"The Defenders\" gets a lot of its early magic. Although common knowledge to the hardcore comic-book fan, but perhaps not the casual viewer, Cage and Rand are one of Marvel's most classic, popular comic-book duos.\n\nAlthough their bromance starts off rocky, they begin to let their guard down and not pulverize each other, and become an on-screen duo fueled by geeky comic-book chi. It's a treat to watch.\n\nYou're probably wondering how well Iron Fist fits in on this new show, because his namesake series was the first Marvel Entertainment product in some time to receive less-than-positive reviews from critics and fans. But this isn't \"Iron Fist.\" It's \"The Defenders.\" When Rand is teamed up with Cage, the moments feel as cool as they were intended to be -- and Rand has a much better haircut this time around. (If the Netflix/gentrified Iron Fist still just wasn't your thing, you'll at least enjoy Cage checking Rand on his privilege.)\n\nElsewhere, Elektra (Elodie Yung) is back from the dead (yes, you'll see how) and serves as the last line of defense between the Defenders and Alexandra. This resurrection leads Daredevil to wonder whether Elektra has lost her soul, and results in some cool Elektra vs. Iron Fist action when she engages against the group.\n\nThe episodes hit a new pace when Daredevil and Elektra's blind, martial arts mentor Stick (Scott Glenn) arrives. Daredevil wants no part of Stick's involvement, but Stick is multiple steps ahead of the team when it comes to understanding just what type of threat they're facing.\n\nAnd so it seems Marvel's connected Netflix universe is back on track with no apparent \"Fist\" hangover. The biggest question going into this street-level hero team-up was how four shows with such different vibes would come together as one. The best part of \"The Defenders\"? Watching how they make that happen.", "timeCrawl": "01:44:00", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 446, "date": "2017-08-18", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 453}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8730476", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "id": 596, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "id": 679, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "id": 680, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "id": 1166, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "id": 1196, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal_Craft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal Craft", "id": 1242, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Well worth the wait, the new show is every bit the event that Marvel fans hoped it could be.\n\nThe coming together of the streaming service's four superhero shows -- each with varying styles on how to be a hero -- works in part because of how they focus on why such a get-together shouldn't work at all.\n\nBut before Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) team up to defend New York City, the producers of the show divide the four into pairs.\n\nMatt Murdock is still reeling from the pain of losing the woman he loved, Elektra (more on that later), and has left his Daredevil/vigilante days behind to focus on being the best lawyer possible. And who should end up needing a good, affordable attorney? Jessica Jones. (Jones is on the bad side of Misty Knight, played by Simone Missick. Could Misty have a future as a Defender, too?)\n\nMurdock and Jones butt heads from the start as they realize they're both investigating something that connects to an evil scheme too big for the both of them.\n\nThat something is Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra, who may be the biggest surprise of \"The Defenders,\" which begins Friday. She's a compelling villain with a mysterious past that borders on the unbelievable - we can't say more than that without giving too much away.\n\nAlso on Alexandra's trail is Danny Rand, the Immortal Iron Fist, who realizes that she is connected to some of his father's company's previous shady financial dealings. Some of the grunt work of those deals is handled by young men in Harlem, which puts Luke Cage into the path of the Iron Fist. Literally: The two come to blows before Cage gets a chi-glowing fist to the jaw.\n\nThe Luke Cage/Iron Fist combo is where \"The Defenders\" gets a lot of its early magic. Although common knowledge to the hardcore comic-book fan, but perhaps not the casual viewer, Cage and Rand are one of Marvel's most classic, popular comic-book duos.\n\nAlthough their bromance starts off rocky, they begin to let their guard down and not pulverize each other, and become an on-screen duo fueled by geeky comic-book chi. It's a treat to watch.\n\nYou're probably wondering how well Iron Fist fits in on this new show, because his namesake series was the first Marvel Entertainment product in some time to receive less-than-positive reviews from critics and fans. But this isn't \"Iron Fist.\" It's \"The Defenders.\" When Rand is teamed up with Cage, the moments feel as cool as they were intended to be -- and Rand has a much better haircut this time around. (If the Netflix/gentrified Iron Fist still just wasn't your thing, you'll at least enjoy Cage checking Rand on his privilege.)\n\nElsewhere, Elektra (Elodie Yung) is back from the dead (yes, you'll see how) and serves as the last line of defense between the Defenders and Alexandra. This resurrection leads Daredevil to wonder whether Elektra has lost her soul, and results in some cool Elektra vs. Iron Fist action when she engages against the group.\n\nThe episodes hit a new pace when Daredevil and Elektra's blind, martial arts mentor Stick (Scott Glenn) arrives. Daredevil wants no part of Stick's involvement, but Stick is multiple steps ahead of the team when it comes to understanding just what type of threat they're facing.\n\nAnd so it seems Marvel's connected Netflix universe is back on track with no apparent \"Fist\" hangover. The biggest question going into this street-level hero team-up was how four shows with such different vibes would come together as one. The best part of \"The Defenders\"? Watching how they make that happen.", "timeCrawl": "16:27:00", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8940095", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "id": 7, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "id": 679, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "id": 680, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "id": 1166, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "id": 1196, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal_Craft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal Craft", "id": 1242, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Clarkson, a director and executive producer on Marvel and Netflix's The Defenders, has revealed why the show's New York superheroes don't meet up in the first episode. The Defenders is Marvel TV's first-ever major crossover event, bringing Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) together to fight The Hand - a mysterious group that operates under the supervision of the enigmatic Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver).\n\nFollowing two seasons of Daredevil the TV series and single seasons of Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist, the 8-episode Defenders miniseries drops on Friday, August 18. The wait, however, for the foursome to finally come together will be a bit longer - as they encounter each other only in passing in the series premiere, not knowing that they are bound to eventually become a team. While that may come as disappointing news to those fans eager to see The Defenders properly unite Clarkson promises that the wait will be worth it.\n\nRelated: The Defenders is a 'One-Off Show'\n\nSpeaking to The Wrap, Clarkson - who directed the first two episodes of The Defenders - explained why the show starts with its heroes doing their own things separate from one another:\n\n\"My hope is that people who haven't seen any of the shows might tune in and watch \"The Defenders,\" and enjoy it in its own right. Well, I actually think there's no rush for those people because they don't know them. So you want time to sort of reintroduce the characters and sort of spend time with them, to really understand who they are, understand where they're at, so when they do finally meet I think the payoff is greater cause you've had time to sit with them and settle in where they are.\"\n\nClarkson also explained how this storytelling approach makes The Defenders accessible to newcomers, yet at the same time rewarding for those viewers who have seen all of the previous Marvel/Netflix TV shows:\n\n\"I wanted it to feel like is when you watch it you were being introduced to these characters for the first time but equally, if you were familiar with them, you were sitting back down with an old friend.\"\n\nAll things considered, this sounds like a good way to show what Matt, Jessica, Luke, and Danny are up to on their own, before they have to come together and foil Alexandra's plans. This should allow the dynamic between the heroes to develop in a more organic fashion, in addition to making it easier for them to set them off to their respective adventures once again, once The Defenders season one has concluded.\n\nThat approach seems to have mostly panned out too, with The Defenders' early reviews having proven to be mostly positive thus far. The main gripe, however, that critics seem to have with the series is the inconsistency of its pace - a seemingly recurring problem with even the solo Marvel/Netflix shows, as it were.\n\nNEXT: Why Marvel's ABC TV Shows Are So Different From Netflix\n\nThe Defenders premieres August 18 on Netflix, followed by The Punisher season 1 sometime this fall. Premiere dates for the new seasons of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist have yet to be announced.\n\nSource: The Wrap\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

"body": "Marvel's \"The Defenders\" comes to Netflix on August 18, representing one of the biggest TV superhero events in history. \"#The Defenders\" represents the culmination of Marvel and Netflix' investment in superhero world building over the last two years.\n\nThe 8-episode miniseries brings together the story lines of the four Marvel comic book superheroes featured previously in their own Netflix series, including Daredevil/Matt Murdock, played by Charlie Cox, Jessica Jones, played by Krysten Ritter, Mike Colter's Luke Cage, and Finn Jones as Iron Fist/Danny Rand. All four live in #New York City, from Luke Cage uptown in Harlem to Danny Rand in his billionaire's sleek downtown apartment.\n\nAs the story begins, Luke Cage is coming out of prison and attempting to get back in touch with Rosario Dawson's Claire Temple, the infinitely patient night nurse that has crossed over into all four of the superhero series. Matt Murdock crosses paths with Jessica Jones as each tries to keep the streets of Hell's Kitchen safe.\n\nVillains include Sigourney Weaver as Alexandra, leader of The Hand, an evil ninja organization. The Hand first appeared in the first season of \"Daredevil\" in the form of Nobu Yoshioka, leader of the Yakuza in Hell's Kitchen. They were the prime villains in \"Iron Fist\", led by Madame Gao. At the end of \"Iron Fist\" season 1, Danny Rand attempts to return to K'un-Lun with Colleen, only to find it gone, and murdered henchmen around the former gate.\n\nHe returns to NYC to get answers, creating the link into \"The Defenders\" story line.\n\nElodie Yung is back as the super assassin and sometime romantic interest to Matt Murdock, Elektra, along with Elden Henson as Foggy, Deborah Ann Woll as Karen of \"Daredevil\", and other peripheral characters from each individual show. Each of the four superheroes has their own story arc -- each of them troubled individuals who clash at first, but finally band together to save the city. Showrunners are Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez, who were also responsible for the second season of \"Daredevil\".\n\nEarly reviews for \"The Defenders\" in the media have been positive, unlike the lukewarm reviews that came with \"Iron Fist\", the most recent solo series. In contrast, \"The Defenders\" gives viewers an action-packed eight episodes with none of the talky scenes or slow paced action seen in some of the individual series. Mike Colter and Sigourney Weaver's performances were singled out by critics as stand outs in the Marvel miniseries.\n\nSome critics suggest that the tighter 8-episode format is a better alternative to the longer 13-episode individual series. Marvel's \"The Defenders\" premieres August 18, 2017, on Netflix. #The Defender", "timeCrawl": "16:27:00", "sim": 0.7450980544090271, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 54, "date": "2017-08-18", "textStart": 45}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8940116", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "id": 246, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "id": 1196, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

While all four heroes will finally be teaming up, it is not going to happen right away, but once it does it will end up changing each of them.\n\nOne of the big things that these four superheroes will have to deal with throughout The Defenders is working as a team and in doing so, it will end up changing who these characters are moving forward into their own shows. According to Bleeding Cool, showrunner Marco Ramirez and members of the cast talked about how the show will impact each of these heroes, and their own solo adventures. Basically, there will be no way for these characters to go back to the way things were before they got together, after the events of The Defenders.\n\nFinn Jones, who plays the Iron Fist/Danny Rand, said that going into the team up, he is dealing with a lot of guilt because he feels he is personally responsible for the loss of an entire city. This means that his mission moving forward is to go up against the organization he feels is responsible for what happened, The Hand, and bring them down.\n\nOf course working as part of a group will be a challenge for Danny because his behavior is often reckless. Even as the Iron Fist, Danny is all about rushing into things, throwing around his money, and punching things and people. When he ends up meeting Luke Cage, he will not be able to do all of this because Luke really is the complete opposite of him. Luke is going to be the person who shows Danny that if he wants to be a part of a team, then there is no way for him to do the things he has been doing.\n\nMike Colter, who plays Luke Cage, pointed out that Danny Rand is not the only one with issues coming into The Defenders. The actor shared that the first few episodes will work as a way to get his character out of the habit of worrying about not only his past, but also about having to look over his shoulder all the time. Colter said the team up will most likely bring about a whole new side of Luke Cage.\n\nWhile Luke Cage and Danny Rand will have their own changes to go through, Daredevil/Matt Murdock and Jessica Jones will be dealing with issues of their own. These two are apparently so much alike, according to Charlie Cox, who plays Daredevil, that they will actually have a hard time getting along. Both characters have strong opinions and are equally stubborn. Over the course of the series, they will find themselves reluctantly liking the other person because there is a sense of respect there.\n\nAlthough the team up will deal with how these four characters come together and work as a team, dealing with their various personalities, this does not mean they all meet up right away. In fact, according to The Wrap, these four will not actually meet up until well into the second episode. S.J. Clarkson, an executive producer for The Defenders, said that having the four heroes wait to all come together was done purposefully. Not only is the payoff greater for fans by having them wait to see all four heroes together, but it also adds more intrigue to the story as well.\n\nWhether they are just missing each other or actually coming together as duos, the first episode and much of the second act as a way to bring viewers up to speed with who these characters are, and what they are doing both for those unfamiliar with their solo adventures, as well as fans who have been through the individual seasons. Audiences will get to see hints to the things that connect all four shows, even as some are more obvious than others. It is because of their own individual pursuits that the team up happens, because all of their hints and tips will lead them to the same place, their newest enemy.\n\nFans will get to see how The Defenders brings these four heroes together and how the team up itself will change them all when the series begins streaming on Netflix on August 18. Even with Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil not meeting up right away, it sounds like the show knows exactly what it was doing with these characters and their ultimate goal to have Marvel's street level heroes come together as a team.", "timeCrawl": "16:38:00", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 12, "date": "2017-08-18", "textStart": 3}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8941386", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "id": 25, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "id": 28, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "id": 30, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The team-up show has been in the works for several years, initially starting with the release of Daredevil in 2015. Since then Netflix and Marvel Television have brought Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist to the table.\n\nThe team will soon be assembled, and so it's time for them to work together - only it's not going to be so easy with The Hand breathing down their necks.\n\nThe Hand have previously been causing problems for both Daredevil and Iron Fist, and are returning as the main villains of The Defenders, being led by Alexandra - played by Sigourney Weaver. There'll be a few problems they'll each have to work through before they save New York, however, and none of them will be the same going forwards.\n\nDuring an interview with Playboy, showrunner Marco Ramirez, Charlie Cox (Daredevil), Mike Colter (Luke Cage) and Finn Jones (Iron Fist) discussed how their characters deal with each other across the series. The group of heroes certainly won't be partnering up straight away, and they'll have plenty of emotional baggage to deal with, as Ramirez discussed the next chapter of their lives:\n\n\"None of us wanted to do the procedural version where they'll go back into their own shows completely unchanged. The events of Defenders will affect each of them. It just really felt like in order to honor the individual character arcs of each of the shows, we needed them to realize this was the next big chapter of their lives, individually.\"\n\nSince The Hand have already proven their capacity for extreme violence and staged attacks, what comes next? We've already had a glimpse of Elektra in the trailer, revived by The Hand as the 'Black Sky'. The resurrection of Matt Murdock's ex-lover will undoubtedly cause some trouble for the man without fear. Although he's also going to find himself struggling with Jessica Jones, who doesn't get along with the blind superhero. Per Cox:\n\n\"They don't like each other. They're too similar. They're too stubborn. They're too opinionated. They don't have time for each other. The stuff that I liked filming the most were those scenes where they start to, against their will, like each other. They kind of respect each other. They would never tell the other person that. That was really fun to play with. That's one of the things I really enjoyed about it. All of our shows had been quite serious, they're tonally quite dark. But you can't put someone like Matt Murdock, who wears a super hero costume in a room with Jessica Jones and not make jokes. You can't.\"\n\nSomeone we haven't seen in a proper costume yet is Danny Rand. But it doesn't seem like the latest addition to Netflix will have the easiest personal ride in The Defenders. Finn Jones mentioned Danny's guilty conscience about underestimating The Hand and losing an entire city:\n\n\"Danny is responsible for the loss of a whole city. He's majorly f*cked up. The guilt that is heavy on his heart is really making him spearhead forward with this mission to take down The Hand. Danny's very reckless in his behavior. He's just punching things, throwing his cash around. He comes into someone like Luke Cage, who is the complete opposite, and Luke's just like, 'Whoa, kid. If we're going to work together, you need to really realize a few things.'\"\n\nDanny clearly still has a lot to learn about being a vigilante and helping people. Some of that vigilante education will come from working with Luke Cage. Cage is the exact opposite of Danny, and their differences will see the pair butt heads (or fists) when they begin working as a whole team. Luke's journey in The Defenders has him trying to readjust after spending time in prison at the end of his solo series. Mike Colter spoke about how Luke's personality will change after that:\n\n\"The first four episodes serve to get him out of that world, and out of the mentality of looking over your shoulder, and worrying about your past. I think we will see a new Luke because of it.\"\n\nCage will be a free man once again, and an innocent one at that. So after his liberation, it's possible he might want to toe the line for a while just to ensure he doesn't wind up back in jail. His reluctance to join the team will likely come from wanting to keep his down, until something or someone persuades him otherwise.\n\nAs exciting as all these teases are, we'll have to wait till Friday 18 to see how Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and the Iron Fist all deal with the threat of The Hand.\n\nNext: Netflix Begins Final Countdown To The Defenders\n\nSource: Playboy\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

There are a lot of great characters from Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist (yes we actually liked Iron Fist) and we expect this group to have some growing pains while working together - which should make for some great drama! We are especially looking forward to seeing a very naive Danny Rand going up against the angsty Jessica Jones, but while there are aspects of the show we are excited about, there are also some things that have us worried going into The Defenders season 1.\n\nSeasons 1 of Daredevil and Jessica Jones really set the bar high for the rest of the Marvel superhero franchise (interesting heroes, layered villains), so when Luke Cage came out we were riding high (especially with Mike Colter as the lead). While Colter was everything we hoped he would be, the story and the villains left much to be desired since Luke is an unstoppable force. Then we got to Daredevil season 2 where there was so much going on that it felt like two different shows crammed together with not enough time to flush out any stories (we really didn't need Punisher AND Elektra). When Iron Fist came out we were worried especially when other critics were pounding this show into the ground for having a Caucasian lead (to be fair, the character of Danny Rand is Caucasian in the comics). After watching the show we were hooked, especially with characters like Colleen Wing and Ward Meachum. Danny Rand wasn't our favorite character and reminded us of Luke Skywalker during his whiny years, but that's what he was supposed to be so he did the job well. This started to get our hopes up that The Defenders wouldn't be a disaster.\n\nWe know we are going to get dog piled for saying this since everyone and their cat had a problem with Danny Rand being Caucasian (we've already addressed our feelings on that), but the rest of the characters bring us the diversity we want. Going into the Defenders (airing on Friday, August 18th on Netflix), we are excited to have a pretty diverse crew with a African American superhero, a female superhero and a blind superhero (disabilities aren't often featured in this capacity). We also like how different these characters all are: Jessica is angry and drunk, Matt is constantly conflicted, Luke is smooth and Danny is still growing up. As we said earlier, we think this is going to really help bring the drama when it comes to the growing pains of this group trying to work together. We can see Danny getting on everyone's nerves and ultimately Matt taking him under his wing to help him grow up a bit.\n\nWhat we are worried about are the villains. When Netflix does a villain right, it's so spot on that it doesn't compare to anything else out there. We've seen that with Wilson Fisk, Kilgrave and Gao, but then we've have Cottonmouth who was castrated right from the first episode and never really made his mark while Mariah didn't make much of an impression on us either. We have Sigorney Weaver coming in as the big bad for The Defenders and while we know she can act, we wonder if she is going to really be able to go up against this group. Our hope is that she has some kind of super power since no one has really been able to beat Luke's super human strength except Kilgrave with his mind control. What we don't want to see is a villain who also has super strength since we already have three main characters with this ability.\n\nThe other issue we want to address is the \"too many stories\" issue that some of these shows have been facing. Daredevil season 2 was a mess in our opinion when it came to too many stories and not enough time and we don't want to see that happen here. With all of the Defenders baggage and many of their villains and friends still running around the city this cast has the potential to be massive! We are hoping to only get small samplings of some side characters like Foggy, Misty, or Colleen, but after seeing the trailer we think everyone's going to be involved to some degree. What we want to see is the cast scaled back and just have Claire the night nurse bring our four superheroes together and watch that unfold. The Elektra's, Karen's and and Ward's of this universe should take a back seat for season 1... but it seems that's not going to happen.\n\nWhat are you expecting from The Defenders season 1?

"Ahead of Marvel's The Defenders arriving on Netflix, here are some comics you may want to check out...\n\nThis article comes from Den of Geek UK.\n\nThis August, Marvel will finally deliver the team-up its TV fans have been waiting for when Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist come together to battle The Hand in the Marvel/Netflix co-production The Defenders.\n\nBut what if you can't wait that long? Well, good news: these characters have been teaming up in the comics for years. And whether you want to get a fix ahead of watching the Netflix show or familiarise yourself with who these characters are and what they do, this list of comics should help you...\n\nShadowland\n\nThis street-level crossover event marks the culmination of a long-running storyline in which Daredevil takes control of The Hand after defeating its masters. After initially trying to keep them on the right side of the law, Shadowland sees him using the ninja death squad as his personal army in New York, to the obvious chagrin of his costumed pals. As you can imagine, this behaviour isn't completely on the level and it soon brings him into conflict with the likes of Spider-Man, Luke Cage & Iron Fist, and even Ghost Rider as they battle to save not just the city, but the soul of their friend.\n\nOf course, in addition to the team-up action, this story famously features The Beast of the Hand, who we're fairly sure will be a part - at least in some capacity - of The Defenders. So as well as being a good story in its own right, it'll allow you to get some extra fanboy/fangirl thrills out of the TV show too!\n\nMarvel Knights #1-15\n\nThis 15-issue ongoing series featured a 'non-team' comprising Daredevil, Shang-Chi, the Black Widow and Cloak & Dagger as they attempt to track down and capture The Punisher. Throughout its run it guest-starred Doctor Strange, Moon Knight, Luke Cage and more besides.\n\nNot only will it give you a chance to see some great Daredevil/Punisher scenes and a closer look at the comics versions of some MCU characters you might not have encountered before, it'll ALSO give you a chance to get familiar with Cloak and Dagger ahead of their forthcoming series, which debuts on Freeform next year.\n\nImmortal Iron Fist #7-13\n\nIt's no secret that the Iron Fist Netflix series wasn't as well received as the others, but don't let that sour you on the character. This arc from Immortal Iron Fist, titled The Seven Capital Cities Of Heaven, shows Danny Rand exploring the ongoing legacy of the Iron Fist as he's summoned to K'un L'un to fight in a tournament against a group of Immortal Weapons, each representing their own mystical city. There are a few appearances by the likes of Luke Cage, Colleen Wing, and Misty Knight, but it's mostly a great Danny solo story that illustrates just how cool the character can be - and given that Iron Fist and K'un L'un are reportedly quite prominent in The Defenders (or at least in the opening episode) it's worth catching up on who and what they are.\n\nAlias (Vol. 1) #1-9\n\nThe first volume of Jessica Jones' solo title sees her caught up in a conspiracy surrounding Captain America and his former sidekick, Rick Jones. This is the way she was introduced to the Marvel Universe, and you'll see the likes of Luke Cage and Carol Danvers (aka Captain Marvel) as well as (of course) Captain America. It's worth pointing out that like the Netflix shows, this is aimed at adults (perhaps even more so than the Netflix shows) so there are instances of swearing and graphic scenes that would make it unsuitable for younger readers. Luckily, if you're old enough to watch The Defenders you're old enough to enjoy superheroes occasionally saying the word fuck, so y'know, have at it.\n\nDaredevil #190-191\n\nThe trailer for The Defenders has already made it clear that Elektra will be rejoining the land of the living, so why not read how that went down the very first time it happened? Daredevil #190 is titled Resurrection and shows how the Hand attempt to bring Elektra back to life. With flashbacks to Elektra's past, training with Stick, the story shows DD teaming up with the Black Widow and Stone (also a member of Stick's ninja order, The Chaste) to prevent her resurrection. The following issue shows Daredevil engaged in a game of Russian Roulette with Bullseye, and we're throwing that in for good measure because it's easily one of the best Daredevil comics ever.\n\nPower Man And Iron Fist #50-#54\n\nAfter headlining his own book for 49 issues, Iron Fist became a co-headliner with issue #50, which was written and drawn by famed X-Men creators Chris Claremont and John Byrne, no less. Four issues later they formally incorporate as the Heroes for Hire, bringing into existence a brand and partnership that continues to this day. If you want to know what's getting people so excited about Danny and Luke teaming up on screen, this is the place you need to look.\n\nDefenders (2017)\n\nThis series deliberately took the line-up of the forthcoming TV show - Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist - and folded them into a story that features other MCU mainstays like The Punisher and Black Cat. The first arc is still ongoing at this point, and that makes it a great time to hop on board and catch up with the story, which sees them facing off against Diamondback, who was the villain in the latter half of Luke Cage's Netflix series. It's hard to say just how good it'll be once it all pans out, but in terms of getting you up to date with the characters as they stand, there's no better place to look.\n\nDaredevil: Dark Nights #6-8\n\nThis three-part story from a Daredevil anthology series features Matt Murdock teaming up with Misty Knight in the unlikely setting of the Caribbean as the pair take down a crime boss together. Written by Jimmy Palmiotti, it's a small but perfectly-formed team-up between two long-standing Marvel characters who are both big parts of the Netflix MCU. Naturally, you'll also be able to catch some cameos by Iron Fist's Colleen Wing who, along with Knight, forms the other half of the Daughters of the Dragon. Misty Knight is one of those characters who seems likely to hop between Netflix series - indeed, she's announced for the cast of Iron Fist season 2 - so it's worth checking out her adventures on the page.\n\nPower Man And Iron Fist (2016) #1-5\n\nCollected as The Boys Are Back, this Power Man/Iron Fist team-up puts the characters back where they belong: together. In an attempt to stop the city of New York being poisoned by magic, the heroes team up to punch their way through the underworld and stop the villains behind it. Expect cameos from Jessica Jones (naturally) and plenty of absurdist exploitation-style comedy the likes of which the Netflix shows are a little too serious to adapt. It's great fun, and if the original team-up comics are too retro for you, this is about as modern as it gets!\n\nThe Marvel/Netflix miniseries The Defenders will be available to viewers on 18 August.\n\nRead and download the full Den of Geek Special Edition magazine here!", "timeCrawl": "16:27:00", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 6972, "date": "2017-08-18", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 6981}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8940119", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "id": 25, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "id": 246, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "id": 679, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "id": 680, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Next Friday, August 18th, will see the full eight episodes of the series premiere on the streaming giant and will hopefully wash out much of the sour taste of the first season of Iron Fist, the last and worst Marvel series to be released thus far.\n\nThankfully, Netflix's latest and final trailer for the show, which you can take a look at below, makes a case for Iron Fist, played by Game of Thrones alum Finn Jones, being a character worth giving a care about. The shots of his actual \"iron fist\" look pretty sweet, as does the action set-pieces in the series on the whole. The fights here look genuinely thrilling, a lesson that the series clearly learned from Daredevil, the most electrifying of the Netflix-Marvel shows. For all the promise of Luke Cage as a series, its fight scenes were cut into a blur and directed with a frustrating carelessness, likely to make more room for the convoluted plot. If The Defenders can simply make the hand-to-hand combat look good and build tension, it will have already outdone Iron Fist.\n\nThe more pressing question -- one that can't be answered yet -- is whether or not The Defenders will be as emotionally resonant and thematically dense as Jessica Jones, the all-around best of the Marvel-Netflix shows. Under all its fireworks and fights, Jessica Jones was about abuse, survival, grief, and addiction, subjects that deserve to be taken seriously and which the creators of the series clearly made an effort to underline without going full didactic. The Defenders will hinge on compromise, teamwork, community, and respect, which are no less important subjects than the ones studied in Jessica Jones.

With Alexandra stepping out of the shadows as the possible leader of The Hand, the Defenders will need to pull together all of their allies. While we know the full team won't meet up in the first episode, it won't be long until they join forces.\n\nEventually, The Defenders will not only unite Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, but at least one scene will feature the entire Marvel Netflix cast joined together. From hero-in-training Hellcat to an all-new evil version of Elektra, a number of Marvel's most popular characters will soon be together on the small screen. Promotion has been kicking into high gear the past few weeks as the show's release date approaches, and now Netflix has officially started the countdown.\n\nFor a number of Netflix subscribers, there's now a countdown clock for the release of the show. While it doesn't appear to be available for everyone, it's likely it will appear on the streaming service this weekend. A Reddit user, who was able to grab a shot of the countdown clock, also indicated that new promos were available for the show. Again, this may vary from user to user at this point.\n\nThe Official Defenders US Profile has a Countdown to next Friday and some cool new promo clips from marvelstudios\n\nIn the meantime, TV & Satellite Week magazine (via MarvelStudiosMovies) have a new cover story on The Defenders. It includes a new shot of the group, with Matt looking very out of place in his costume.\n\n#TheDefenders on @TVSatelliteWeek magazine cover@TheDefenders @Daredevil @JessicaJones @LukeCage @MarvelIronFist @Krystenritter @FinnJones pic.twitter.com/KFIZQ0ISYm -- MarvelStudiosMovies (@AidarSM)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nWhile Daredevil is usually shrouded in shadows, his mask doesn't exactly work with the street clothes the other heroes are wearing. Hopefully, he'll get another upgrade soon (and Danny will suit up as well).\n\nThe Defenders is bound to set up the next seasons of each show, promising some major character growth. Matt and Karen will be dealing with the fallout of the hero revealing his identity to her, while Danny will be completing his arc as a hero. Luke and Jessica, meanwhile, may make some tentative steps towards their future relationship together.\n\nWith the show dropping all eight episodes this Friday, we won't have to wait much longer to learn what The Defenders will bring.\n\nNext: New Poster and Images from The Defenders Arrive\n\nThe Defenders premieres August 18 on Netflix, followed by The Punisher season 1 sometime this fall. Premiere dates for the new seasons of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist have yet to be announced.\n\nSources: Netflix, Reddit, & MarvelStudiosMovies\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

So the following is a brief overview of the first half of this historic collaboration - the best and worst of The Defenders thus far.\n\nJessica Jones Jokes\n\nIt's all a bit serious in the show's early scenes. Daredevil and Iron Fist are both in a bad place, the pair struggling to deal with the grim fallout from their most recent adventures. And there are bad things happening in Hell's Kitchen, the details of which we won't go into here. But Jessica Jones is on-hand to brighten things up with a witty one-liner or a sly put-down.\n\nJones is absolutely hilarious in the first few episodes, deeply suspicious of her new superhero status early in proceedings, then taking every chance to undercut her fellow Defenders when they finally meet. She mocks Danny Rand's brief bouts of optimism and Luke Cage's super-strength, while Jones continually busts Matt Murdock's balls, at one point threatening to punch him so hard that he'll see.\n\nKrysten Ritter delivers her lines with deadpan cynicism, and it's clear that as the stakes are raised and their situation becomes ever-more dire, Jones will ensure The Defenders don't take themselves too seriously.\n\nStick Returns\n\nStick played the role of mentor, trainer, and all-around badass in Daredevil, and in the first Defenders trailer, he narrates proceedings, putting each of the superheroes in their place via voiceover, and calling the mysterious threat that unites them the 'War for New York.'\n\nBut what of his actual involvement in the series? Well, we aren't about to describe his introduction, as it's a doozy. What we will say is that Stick - as played by the inimitable Scott Glenn - is on scene-stealing form. The character is more badass than ever, delivering the best moment in two of the four episodes that we've seen. And doing something that really has to be seen to be believed. So we're hoping there's a lot more Stick as the story progresses.\n\nCorridor Action\n\nAmazing corridor action sequences have become the Marvel-Netflix trademark. Daredevil started the tradition, and every show since has had a go, sometimes tweaking the setting to a stairwell or passageway, but always limiting the carnage to an enclosed space so audiences get a good look at the brilliantly choreographed close-quarters combat.\n\nThe Defenders is no different, our four heroes first teaming-up in a well-lit office corridor. The trailers already feature the best bits of this brawl, but what it doesn't show is the top-notch banter between the quartet throughout. Nor how awesome it is to see Luke Cage and Danny Rand working together for the first time. Could a Power Man and Iron Fist show be just around the corner?\n\nPoor Pacing\n\nThe Defenders starts slow. Really slow. While it's initially exciting seeing the gang back onscreen, Episode 1 quickly loses focus. Sure the characters are doing things, but in isolation, and it's all stuff we don't care about yet. Indeed the writers are so busy trying to maneuver the characters into position that they don't really give them anything interesting to say or do. It's like watching a really boring game of superhero chess.\n\nSomething big happens at the end of Episode 1 however, meaning Episode 2 is all about the fallout from that incident. But again it's pretty dull, with each character dealing with it alone, and the narrative jumping from story-to-story when you really just want it to settle into some kind of rhythm. That doesn't happen until Episode 3, which is a long time to wait for The Defenders to start defending.\n\nToo Much Exposition\n\nThere's a lot of plot going on in the early episodes. And it's pretty much all told via dialogue rather than imagery. So we have characters talking about where they've been. What they are going through. And what they plan to do. Matt, Jessica, Luke, and Danny discuss their origins and powers to get newcomers up-to-speed. But that's pretty boring for those of us who have been watching from the start.\n\nAs for the villains, Alexandra has to establish herself and her reasons for wanting to do terrible things in New York. But her plan is somewhat convoluted, with lots of moving parts, and seems to require explanation every five minutes. And while she's played by the amazing Sigourney Weaver, at this point she seems a lot less interesting than previous villains Kingpin and Kilgrave.\n\nSo thus far we've got an action show that's filled with people talking. Which at times makes for a frustrating viewing experience.\n\nIron Fist\n\nRemember how annoying Danny Rand was in his standalone show? Well if anything, he's even worse in these first four episodes. He shows up in the very first scene, searching for members of The Hand in Cambodia. And is annoying. Then he travels back to New York, and is equally annoying.\n\nWe get it - Rand is young, petulant and immature - a man-child searching for his place in the world. But he's also whiny, argumentative, and incredibly hard to like. That might be down to the writing, Finn Jones' performance, or a combination of the two. Whatever the case, Iron Fist is the worst element of The Defenders, so fingers crossed he ups his game in the final four episodes.", "timeCrawl": "16:27:00", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 47, "date": "2017-08-18", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 56}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8940101", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"isDuplicate": false, "body": "Netflix show is newest in ever-expanding Marvel universe and brings together Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil and Iron Fist\n\nThe recent hold of caped crusaders over cinema has been unavoidable, but now a new Netflix show aims to push the boundaries of the superhero genre on television.\n\nThe Defenders, which has been described as the \"urban Avengers\", is the newest show in the ever-expanding Marvel universe and is released on 18 August. It brings together the New York-dwelling outsider superheroes - Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil and Iron Fist, who all had their own individual Netflix shows - and unites them as a quartet to battle the crime syndicate known as The Hand.\n\nThe expensive production and ambition of the project confirms Netflix's commitment to superhero television. This week the streaming site announced it had acquired comic publisher Millarworld, whose roster includes Kick Ass, Kingsman and Wanted, in a move to own and develop its own universe of superhero TV series and films.\n\nThe Defenders began as a comic in the 1970s, with heroes such as Doctor Strange and the Hulk appearing throughout. It was discontinued but in January, ahead of the TV series debut, Marvel relaunched it as a comic book written by one of the comic book company's most popular writers, Brian Michael Bendis. He described it as \"a sprawling, Godfather-like epic at the street level of the Marvel universe\" based around \"a modern, elaborate organised crime story\".\n\nMarvel's head of television, Jeph Loeb, said the decision to bring together the four heroes in a single, eight-episode TV show had been a challenging and risky undertaking. It had been based on the model of Marvel film The Avengers, which united Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America on the big screen after each starring in their own movies.\n\nHe said: \"I think that The Defenders is the most ambitious television project to date, period. We really set out to do something that had never been done in the history of television. From the very beginning, we started and committed to four separate television series, not knowing whether any of them would work.\n\n\"The idea was that at the end of completing all four of them, we would take all of our actors, not knowing if any of them would even be suitable for the roles, and put them together in a story where they would interact with each other and fight a common problem. That's an extraordinary journey.\"\n\nDaredevil, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones were all praised, but fans were critical of Iron Fist.\n\nThe series opens with Luke Cage (Mike Colter) recently out of jail; private investigator Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) drinking hard; Iron Fist Danny Rand (Finn Jones) returned from Cambodia; and blind lawyer Matt Murdock AKA Daredevil (Charlie Cox) working as a pro-bono prosecutor.\n\nLoeb said that a key appeal of bringing these troubled, solitary, often reluctant heroes together in one series was \"that you would get to see what the nature of heroism is from the perspective of four different types of people. It's not easy with the job that they have or the choices that they make, because the choice that they've made is to stand up when everyone is told to sit down. That's really the hardest part about being a hero.\"\n\nIt was a view echoed by Cox, whose character, Matt Murdock, got his powers after being blinded as a child. Cox said: \"If you think about all four of these characters and the possibility that on a daily basis they all live with a level of loneliness and shame around who they are, there is suddenly the possibility to feel part of something, to feel heroic in a completely new sense of the word and to feel understood in a way that they haven't been understood before,\" he said.\n\nThe show's villain is played by Sigourney Weaver, and aside from her name and her immaculate wardrobe, Alexandra Reid, Marvel and Netflix have kept her role and her character's motives secret. Weaver described her as \"a very confident, smart and persuasive leader. When people say that I'm the villain, well, I think that that is just one way to look at the character.\"\n\nShe added: \"To me, Alexandra has a lot of wisdom because she's been doing what she does for a long time and she has a lot of empathy. She's a very complex character and I felt delighted to be a part of that. There's also a lot of comedy, action and a lot of great character work, plus a lot of surprises in the show.\"\n\nThe Defenders' showrunner, Marco Ramirez, said it was driven by the differences and clashing personalities of its four heroes.

Because it was actually four years ago in 2013 when that announcement was first made. Since then, fans have gotten to know Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist as if they were our own neighbors -- and if you live in New York, they kind of are. Case in point! Charlie Cox, Krysten Ritter, Mike Colter and Finn Jones all visited the city (trust me, that's what the cool locals call it) as part of their press tour for the show, and told Nerdist all about how awesome it was to finally team up.\n\nOf course, not everybody on the Defenders is meeting for the first time -- Luke Cage actually debuted on Jessica Jones, where he served as a potential love interest for the titular antiheroine. But at least in the first four episodes of this premiere season, Jessica actually spends more time with Matt Murdock than she does with her former partner.\n\n\"I think Jessica feels like Matt Murdock is on equal footing with her, and she doesn't always feel that way about people,\" Krysten Ritter told Nerdist. \"So she's interested. She kind wants to know what she's about, does a little digging, does her P.I. thing on him, and sort lets him into her life in a way.\"\n\nMeanwhile, despite their decades-long comic book friendship, Luke Cage and Danny Rand do not start out on equal footing; right out of the gate, Luke calls Danny out on his privilege, which will surely delight a lot of fans. \"It's such an iconic relationship in the comics, and it's starting off in such a grounding and compelling way,\" Finn Jones noted about their first conversation.\n\nCheck out the video above to see the stars of The Defenders talk more about how fun it was to \"fanboy\" out about each other -- and about Sigourney Weaver, who plays the show's villain.

It's an exciting prospect, but it also requires viewers to remember what happened on all four of the heroes' respective standalone shows up to this point. Since Daredevil, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist have all aired more recently, and it's been two years since Jessica Jones dropped, let's refresh your memory on what happened to Jessica Jones before The Defenders.\n\n1. Her Backstory\n\nThe one season of Jessica Jones focused on Jones working as a private eye in New York City while also trying to take down Kilgrave, a man with the power of mind control who used to keep Jones under his spell. Jones has powers of her own, namely superhuman strength and the ability to fly. Because of the horrible things Kilgrave would make her do, Jones has developed post-traumatic stress disorder, which she attempts to numb with alcoholism.\n\nAt the end of the season, Jessica succeeds in killing Kilgrave by pretending to be under his control to get close to him. This high-profile killing exposes Jessica and her powers to all of New York, as people begin to call for her help all around the city.\n\n2. Her Complicated Relationship\n\nJessica Jones has a strained relationship with another member of the Defenders, Luke Cage. The two meet and bond over their powers at the beginning of Jessica Jones, and that evolves into an intimate relationship. But when Jessica is forced to remember Kilgrave made her kill Cage's ex-wife Reva Connors while she was still under his control, Cage is unable to forgive Jones and they go their separate ways. It will definitely be interesting to see how they interact in The Defenders.\n\n3. Her Friends\n\nThough Jessica Jones prides herself on being a lone wolf, she actually gets some crucial help from. Her adoptive sister Trish Walker serves as Jones' closest confidant, and the person who most pushes her to use her powers to become a hero. High-powered attorney Jeri Hogarth is another of Jones' close friends, and helps her out of most of the legal issues she finds herself in. Hogarth was also a main player in Iron Fist, so she may be instrumental in bringing Jessica and Danny Rand together in The Defenders.\n\nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge, for more stories you don't want to miss.", "timeCrawl": "16:27:00", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 171, "date": "2017-08-18", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 180}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8940104", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "id": 106, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical", "id": 166, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "id": 466, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "id": 544, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "id": 777, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Control_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Control Systems", "id": 975, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "id": 1031, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "id": 1166, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Check it out above!\n\nIn the clip, Foggy presents Luke with a business card for his new firm Hogarth, Chao, and Benowitz. The clip takes place in the beginning of the first episode, setting the collision course into motion.\n\nWe saw Foggy take a new job with Jeri Hogarth at the end of Daredevil Season 2 after his partnership (and friendship) with Matt Murdock hits the rocks. It's unclear why he's helping Luke at this point, who returned to prison after the events of the first season of his own series.\n\nWe've already seen the Devil of Hell's Kitchen's first meeting with Jessica Jones in the first trailer for the Defenders. We're looking forward to seeing the rest of the heroes come together and the dire circumstances that forces such a meeting.\n\nThe four superheroes of New York City, and their various allies, will have their hands full when they go up against the Hand and their lethal enforcer, the resurrected Elektra. Each character has their own problems to deal with, and teaming up to take on this threat will not be easy.\n\nIt's almost time to find out how it all goes down, with the Defenders premiering on Netflix August 18th.\n\nMarvel's The Defenders follows Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones).

first seasons of Daredevil (starring Charlie Cox) and Jessica Jones (starring Krysten Ritter). Luke Cage had muscular performances, led by the commanding Mike Colter, but a thin plot, while Iron Fist, led by the miscast Finn Jones, was plain and wimpy. But The Defenders -- a team-up saga that assembles the leads and supporting casts of all four shows and resolves some ongoing intrigues -- is a lively genre entertainment that recharges your interest in Marvel pop. It presents as a big event, yet values consolidation. Marvel should embrace this approach moving forward.\n\nUntil now, Netflix's Marvel series have been 13 episodes long. The producers of those shows, even the better ones, have never been able to generate enough plot to fill the time, resulting in thinly stretched, poorly paced volumes of story -- they just don't know how to vamp in compelling fashion. So while capable of fielding singular episodes of great power that drill down on a character or a relationship or some bit of mythological business, they don't do it enough and they rarely do it well, either because the characters aren't deep enough or the writers lack sufficient imagination for them. Each starry show has had a slick, handsome veneer, yet most episodes look under-produced or underfunded, a poverty that makes for dullness. Long, chatty scenes on just a few sets and New York locations, interrupted by an occasional, elaborate fight sequences that's usually spectacular (unless it's happening on Iron Fist): It's like getting promised a generous baker's dozen and getting a bag of donut holes instead.\n\nThe Defenders is eight episodes long, and damn if it doesn't make the case that less is more. Of course, it helps to have four leads and all of their respective dramas and supporting players to service. Each character gets a concise, emotionally resonant individual arc packed with substantial scenes. The first two episodes nimbly move between them, resetting and advancing them while also using them to nurture an intriguing mystery-driven story that brings them together for a solid group fight in episode 3 and some extended banter and bonding in episode 4. The images are sharper and more inspired, the dialogue is wittier, and the pace is breezier than the usual Marvel-Netflix escapade. Kudos to showrunners Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez -- the team behind the disappointing second season of Daredevil -- for upping their own game, honoring the best parts of every series, and elevating the franchise.\n\nMatt Murdock, a blind, big-hearted attorney whose other senses are massively amplified, is struggling with his choice to give up moonlighting as Daredevil while estranged from friends Foggy (Elden Henson) and Karen (Deborah Ann Woll). Jessica Jones, super-strong, super-cynical private investigator, is still recovering from a triggering clash with psychic rapist Kilgrave (David Tennant) and struggling with the whole super-hero thing. Cox and Ritter -- rocking their roles as anti-hero protectors of Hell's Kitchen -- are terrific and give the show its emotional heft. They sell a stand-out sequence in the early going in which they meet, verbally clash, then takes turns stalking and eluding each other in broad daylight.\n\nAs Luke Cage, Colter anchors everything with effortless charisma, grit, and wit. His \"Power Man\" is newly sprung from prison and re-establishing himself as an activist-defender of Harlem and reconnecting with girlfriend Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), night nurse to costumed vigilantes. And Danny Rand, a.k.a. Iron Fist, billionaire hippie and magical white savior of the mystical Easter kingdom of K'un-Lun is... tolerable. His character is central to the story -- Marvel is going to make you love this guy, dammit! -- and almost everything about him remains laughably dumb, from his mythology to the concept and special effect of his \"iron fist.\" But Finn works hard, so hard it's actually endearing. His mediocrity is blunted by his costars, including Jessica Henwick, improved and owning her role as Colleen Wing. The other characters are made to cast shade on Iron Fist with put-downs and eye-rolls. It's mean and it's cheap and it's a degrading use of Colter in particular, and all it does is prove that Iron Fist is a weak link in this would-be fantastic foursome.\n\nGreat villains played by great actors have marked the best seasons of the Marvel-Netflix shows. See: Vincent D'Onofrio's Wilson Fisk of Daredevil, Tenant's Kilgrave of Jessica Jones, and the double-whammy of Mahershala Ali's Cottonmouth and Alfre Woodward's Mariah Dillard of Luke Cage. The Defenders is blessed by a dynamite actress and geek pop royalty: Sigourney Weaver plays Alexandra, death-defying leader of an occult underworld organization known as The Hand. She makes a generic part pop with nuanced menace and elevates everyone involved, notably Elodie Yung as the assassin Elektra. The Defenders is far from perfect. But it's an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations that I hope Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist. If Danny Rand must persist, add him to the other shows and let the stronger players carry him. That's what superfriends are for.", "timeCrawl": "16:27:00", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8940093", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Mark Millar, the man whose work on The Ultimates inspired the on-screen depiction of the Avengers, has a huge cabal of books that explore distinct aspects of comic book archetypes. Not only will Netflix create content based off of the Millarworld catalog, but they will continue to publish new comic series as well.\n\nUnfortunately, Kick-Ass and Kingsman, the two most successful franchises in Millarworld, are not part of the deal. While fans of the movies may be unhappy, I think every Millarworld project on this list has huge potential to capture the hearts of fans around the world. Millar's unique mix of action, satire and heart distinguish his stories from everything else on the shelves, and I'm beyond excited to see what Neflix can whip up. Some of his books can work as movies, but some will work better as mature television programs, so I'm happy that Millarworld teamed up with Netflix instead of a traditional media company like Lionsgate or Sony.\n\nHit Next to find out about the five Millarworld projects Netflix should develop first!\n\nPrevious1 of 6Next\n\nVIEW IN GALLERY", "timeCrawl": "16:27:00", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 462, "amb": false, "textEnd": 477}, {"date": "2017-08-18", "textStart": 1498, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1513}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8940117", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "id": 7, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "id": 243, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "id": 244, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "id": 679, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "id": 680, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "id": 905, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "id": 1166, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It's one of the most anticipated superhero collaboration. The small screen heroes, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist will come together to save New York City from the clutches of a sinister organisation.\n\nPreviously, we have seen Marvel's marquee superheroes come together on the big screen three times - The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Captain America: Civil War. Marvel Studios is currently busy making Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers 4.\n\nDC Extended Universe hasn't had a chance to do so yet since Justice League is set to release in November. But their small screen metahumans, The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, Arrow, have already collaborated to make a spectacular impact.\n\nBlinded as a young boy but imbued with extraordinary senses, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) fights against injustice by day as a lawyer, and by night as the superhero \"Daredevil\" in modern day Hell's Kitchen, New York City.\n\nIn season one, Matt dealt with Wilson Fisk aka Kingpin. But it was the subtle, stealthy villain Madame Gao that kept appearing in all the other Marvel shows on Netflix to make a connecting thread. This is when we met nurse Clair Temple (Rosario Dawson) who is actually a medic on call for these supers.\n\nBy the time season two ended, Matt had his heart broken because he had to give up Elektra (Elodie Young) and watch her die. His friends, Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) and Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll) leave him. He let go of his vigilante avatar to become a pro bono lawyer.\n\nAfter a tragic ending to her short-lived superhero stint, Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is rebuilding her personal life and career as a detective who gets pulled into cases in New York City.\n\nJessica had to fight rapist, mind-controlling psychopath Kilgrave (David Tennant) to save Hell's Kitchen in season one. The show also introduced another superhero Luke Cage in the series. They have a torrid affair only to be ended by Jessica who couldn't trust her surroundings.\n\nAfter a sabotaged experiment leaves him with super strength and unbreakable skin, Luke Cage (Mike Colter) becomes a fugitive trying to rebuild his life in modern day Harlem, New York City. But he is soon pulled out of the shadows and must fight a battle for the heart of his city - forcing him to confront the past he had tried to bury.\n\nThe reluctant superhero show arrived when the talk about racial politics had started gaining momentum and Colter's representation mattered.\n\nBy the end of season one, Luke Cage had managed to fend of Cornell Stokes and Mariah Dillard's attempts to drag down Harlem and surrendered to the police.\n\nDanny Rand is possibly the weakest link out of all Marvel's characters on the screen right now. The show landed with much hoopla but couldn't gain an inch of popularity because of misplaced casting and poor performances by Finn Jones and Jessica Henwick.\n\nIn season one, billionaire Danny Rand (Finn Jones) returns to New York City after being missing for years, trying to reconnect with his past and his family legacy. He fights against the criminal element corrupting the Big Apple with his kung-fu mastery and ability to summon the awesome power of the fiery Iron Fist.\n\nAt the end of season one, Danny is still looking for the members of The Hand and that could be our clue for what is going to happen in The Defenders.", "timeCrawl": "09:37:00", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8896771", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "id": 319, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

If you've watched those shows already, seeing this quartet brought together is the TV equivalent of an \"Avengers\" or \"Justice League\" movie. Sort of.\n\nThe surprising strength of the Netflix model? The fact that a show like \"Daredevil\" is downsized technically and supersized time-wise in comparison to big-budget superhero films only makes the content seem grittier and more human in scale. The gonzo special effects are lacking, but not the psychological depth. (OK, maybe Danny \"Iron Fist\" Rand isn't that deep, but it sure is fun predicting how many times he'll mention K'un-lun per episode.)\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Letterman's Top 10 reasons to do a Netflix series\n\nDisney plans stand-alone streaming service, pulling films from Netflix in 2019\n\nCan \"The Defenders\" live up to the anticipation? After seeing early episodes, we think yes. And not just because of the effective way the story builds to the actual action. Here are five things that should keep you glued to your streaming devices through an epic binge.\n\nExtra-strength girl power: The assemblage of characters from the four shows is a reminder that men don't dominate the narrative, even if they do have three-fourths of the title roles. In fact, the best supporting players are all women, including Detroit's own Simone Missick as tough-but-fair cop Misty Knight from \"Luke Cage.\" Without them, \"The Defenders\" would be missing most of its nuances and much of its smackdown strength.\n\nThe fabulous Sigourney Weaver: Speaking of great actresses, if you're going to have an evil queen, there is no better choice. As a woman linked to an elusive crime organization, Weaver brings strength, subtlety, a regal air and an icy demeanor that may be more intimidating than Luke Cage's bulletproof body or Matt Murdock's devilishly ramped-up senses. Fashion alert: Weaver's armor-like white coat from the first episode is a costume Emmy waiting to be given.\n\nSuper soap opera: As \"The Defenders\" explores the personal challenges awaiting each member of the super-team, the focus sharpens on what happens in between those memorable fight scenes. This is top-notch drama played for much higher stakes than the usual crime-fighting/hospital-working/Chicago-saving prime time network fare.\n\nVisual punch: The stylish cinematography that uses overhead shots and glimpses of faces through windows to convey a mood. The attention to lighting that turns an ordinary interior setting into a dim, scary fun house. The lingering close-ups that give the actors time to reveal their reactions across their gorgeous faces. You're looking good, \"Defenders\"!\n\nHome run derby: Essentially, this is an all-star gathering that lets fans decide -- even if their choice vacillates every episode -- which character is their favorite. Like the Home Run Derby the night before baseball's All-Star Game, it encourages the stars to flex their acting muscles and their real ones, too. It's anyone's contest to win (except for Danny Rand, but he is more tolerable here than usual).\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2w0tPcq", "timeCrawl": "11:20:00", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8907362", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

And he's decided to hang up the suit, as it were,\" Cox shared at San Diego Comic Con. \"He's focusing all of his energies on being a pro bono lawyer. And I don't think he has any interest, really, in being Daredevil anymore.\"\n\nWhy did the self-proclaimed protector of Hell's Kitchen decide to focus on helping its citizens only in the courts, and no longer on the streets? How did Matt Murdock get to that point? If you haven't binged both seasons of Daredevil -- or if you have, and you need a refresher -- check out our cliff notes cram in the video above.

The fact that creator Cheo Hodari Coker and the writers chose to embed popular historical figures such as Crispus Attucks and Walter Mosely in their dialogues, and paid a tribute to Trayvon Martin with Luke's (Mike Colter) hoodie, made it even more powerful.\n\nColter is now coming together with the three other superheroes - Charlie Cox's Daredevil, Krysten Ritter's Jessica Jones, and Finn Jones' Iron Fist - for an eight-episode cross-over event, The Defenders, which hits Netflix next Friday. But if you ask him about being \"the only black guy\", as one reporter did during a press event in New York last week, Colter said he's never approached it in that fashion.\n\n\"I'll be honest, I think any time any black person or minority ascends to any sort of success, they always have to take a path that is sort of littered with non-ethnic people, because it's not a road that's travelled,\" Colter added. \"There's [former US President Barack]Obama. We know that, and it's not like there are no other people like Obama, but it was Obama. Now, Obama had to be that first guy.\"\n\n\"When you look at any time you're in a room and you're the only minority, the thing is, to be successful you're never thinking that. The person who's successful is never thinking that. If you're thinking that you're the only minority you're probably using your brain space for the wrong thing. The only thing you should be thinking about it is how to be successful.\"\n\n\"I've always embraced that, because I have been the only black guy in the room many times in my life. But, I've embraced it because I feel like, because I'm not thinking about it, I'm suited to be that only black guy. When you're pre-occupied mentally with being the only minority, the only woman, the only anything, you're at a disposition. You're setting yourself up for failure, because that's a lot of energy that's put in the wrong direction. So, it's best to not think about it.\"\n\nAnother strong theme of Luke Cage's first season was its commentary on the US judicial system, which revolved around Luke being an escaped convict. He does end up back in prison by the end of the season, which thankfully ends up being a short stint in this case, as becomes clear from the opening moments of The Defenders. Colter thinks while that commentary is important, the bigger takeaway is how the character deals with it.\n\n\"When I look at it, I don't think of him as a convict, blah blah blah. But, I do think of him as a person who has had all these things done to him, dealt a bad hand here,\" Colter said. \"But, he's also, [..] always forward, forward always. He's not looking back, he's not feeling sorry for himself, he's just figured out how to go forward, and that's what I think is the main thing people have to take from it. He's not ever really throwing himself a pity party, he's just trying to rebuild, reset and go forward.\"\n\nColter is currently busy shooting Luke Cage season two, which he said would be about \"a completely different Cage trying to find himself and sort of understand what it is to be like, out front and centre, and having these responsibilities for a community\".

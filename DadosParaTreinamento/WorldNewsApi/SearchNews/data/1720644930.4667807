A criminal case was unsealed May 24 against Leonardo Nunez, 20, after he was extradited from the Cook County Jail in the March 23 death of Damien Abenante, 14, of Chicago. Nunez is charged with one count of murder. He appeared in court Friday where his lawyer John Canrell petitioned for a bail review hearing, court filings show. A date is not yet set. His next court appearance is July 26. Nunez is currently being held without bond. Whiting Police responded around 5:30 a.m. March 23 to the 1600 block of La Porte Avenue. Det. Brad Stelow wrote a pair of white shoes and a cell phone was still on the sidewalk. Abenante was taken to St. Catherine\u2019s in East Chicago. Three bullet casings were found in a yard across the street. By the time Stelow got to the hospital, Abenante had already died. The Lake County Coroner\u2019s Office said the teen was shot in the chest. His death was ruled a homicide. No guns were recovered. A witness told police he heard two \u201cpops\u201d before seeing a male in a red sweatshirt running from the scene. Security footage about a block away captured a black Nissan driving toward Indianapolis Boulevard just after the shooting. The vehicle was registered to Nunez\u2019s relative. The driver was a \u201cyounger, light skinned\u201d man with \u201cdistinct facial features.\u201d Police matched the footage to Nunez\u2019s BMV photo.

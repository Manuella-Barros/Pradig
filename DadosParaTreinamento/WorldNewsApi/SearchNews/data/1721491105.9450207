The reason for the incident has yet to be ascertained, but eyewitnesses in the area said the priest was returning alongside some other persons from an early morning Mass at the St. Michael Catholic Church, when the vehicle he was moving in, was double-crossed by the assailants. This is just as the Anambra State Police Command spokesman, Tochukwu Ikenga, who confirmed the development, said the police had begun a search for the victims by deploying their intelligence and operational assets for their possible rescue unhurt. The eyewitnesses in the area said, \u201cThe priest and some other persons were returning from St. Michael Catholic Church, where they attended a morning service. \u201cOn getting to the Amagu Junction, their vehicle was double-crossed by armed men operating in three vehicles. While two other persons escaped the scene, the assailants took away the priest and one other person, including some personal belongings of the occupants in the vehicle.\u201d The Diocese of Ekwulobia confirmed the abduction in a letter from the Diocesan Chancellor, Rev. Fr. Lawrence Nwankwo, calling for prayers for the safe release of the kidnapped individuals. The letter partly read, \u201cDear Brothers and Sisters, call for prayers. Kidnap case, Rev. Fr.

The ministry called on Germany to resolve arising issues through diplomatic channels in light of recent deportations. Following the death of a German police officer caused by an Afghan citizen in Mannheim, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that Germany is in talks with Afghanistan's neighbouring countries to facilitate the deportation of Afghan migrants. Chancellor Scholz highlighted that the presence of certain individuals in Germany poses a threat to the nation's security and stability. He announced that Germany will strengthen its deportation laws to make praise for terrorist crimes a ground for deportation, in response to a series of attacks that have sparked demands for a tougher immigration policy. Military affairs experts emphasize the need for migrants to comply with the security laws of their host countries. Sadiq Shinwari, a military affairs expert, stated, \"Foreign countries must also respect all immigration laws and conventions, and they should not violate these accepted immigration laws.\" The issue of deporting Afghan and other migrants intensified following an incident in Mannheim, southwest Germany. During a demonstration organized by an anti-Islamic movement, an Afghan citizen injured several people, including a police officer who later succumbed to his injuries.

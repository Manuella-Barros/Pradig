(Getty)\n\nAfter years of fans hoping and praying, Cher's two-part memoir has finally been given a release date -- and it can't come out quickly enough.\n\nThe legendary pop star announced she began working on the memoir back in 2018, with the book originally slated for a 2020 release. Obviously, that never quite happened. But it's second time lucky for Cher, who is finally releasing the book, Cher: The Memoir, Part One in November 2024.\n\nCher took to Instagram on Wednesday (24 July) to share a black-and-white book cover of her upcoming memoir. \"Please be ten parts,\" one fan urged, while another quipped that they've \"pre-ordered immediately.\"\n\nWhoopi Goldberg even commented beneath the post, writing: \"I can't wait Cher, I'm excited & yes Please read the Audiobook it would be so great to hear your voice and feel your vibe in every word.\"\n\nDey Street Books, which is an imprint of the William Morrow Group at HarperCollins Publishers, said in a statement: \"After more than 70 years of fighting to live her life on her own terms, Cher finally reveals her true story in intimate detail, in a two-part memoir.\n\n\"With her trademark honesty and humour, Cher: The Memoir traces how this diamond in the rough succeeded with no plan and little confidence to become the trailblazing superstar the world has been unable to ignore for more than half a century.\"\n\nThe first portion is set to detail the \"Believe\" singer's early life as a child, before growing up and going on to marry fellow performer Sonny Bono, \"the highly complicated relationship that made them world-famous, but eventually drove them apart\".\n\nKnown as Sonny & Cher, the pair married in 1964 and co-hosted the Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and The Sonny & Cher Show. Cher filed for divorce from her former husband in 1974, which was finalised the following year.\n\nThe singer, 78, told viewers on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon last November that she struggled to open up about the difficult parts of her life in the book. \"I just totally chickened out. I didn't put in some things that need to be in, and they're not comfortable.

From her romance with Tom Cruise to the outrageously divine Bob Mackie design she wore to the 1986 Oscars, the 78-year-old superstar has lived a grand life. That's why her upcoming book, Cher: The Memoir, is going to be an epic saga -- and we can't wait!\n\nThe book will be divided into two parts, so her fans can relish in all the juicy tales she's going to spill. Part One will be out on Nov. 19, 2024, and Part Two will publish in 2025. The first book is going to be a long one at 480 pages, but it's sure to be a hit based on HarperCollins Publishers' description alone. \"The extraordinary life of Cher can be told by only one person . . . Cher herself,\" they wrote on Amazon. \"After more than seventy years of fighting to live her life on her own terms, Cher finally reveals her true story in intimate detail, in a two-part memoir.\"\n\nOf course, the publishers also acknowledged what we already knew: \"It is a life too immense for only one book.\" However, Cher didn't always see her life that way, telling Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show in 2023 that she started working on her life story in 2017 and then \"totally chickened out.\" She added, \"I didn't put in some things that needed to be in, and they're not comfortable, but they need to be in, so I have to go back and man up. I've lived too long and done too much, and so it's like it should be the encyclopedia.\"\n\nFans can expect Cher: The Memoir, Part One to cover her childhood through her Sonny Bono marriage which ended in divorce in 1978. They shared one child, Chaz Bono, 55, but Sonny and Cher soon discovered that their \"highly complicated relationship that made them world-famous\" was what ultimately \"drove them apart.\" Sonny died in 1998 after hitting a tree during a skiing accident in Lake Tahoe. It was Cher, not his widow Mary Bono, who gave the emotional eulogy.\n\n\"I've had the strangest response to that eulogy of anything that I can remember,\" Cher told the Seattle Times in 1998 about her speech at the funeral which was televised by MSNBC and CNN. \"People liked it very much, and that seems strange to me. It's one of those weird things that happen, where you do something without thinking others are going to be impressed by it. When I got up to the podium, I was in a strange state of not seeing and not hearing.

Warren pleaded with Cher to record it. She even got down on her knees and begged Cher to take the song. \"I told her I wasn't going to leave the room until she said 'Yes,'\" remembered Warren, \"and finally, just to get rid of me, she did.\"\n\nOnce released on her 1989 album Heart of Stone, \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" became one of Cher's biggest hits, peaking at went to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the charts in several countries. Despite her earlier solo success with early-'70s No. 1s \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves,\" \"Half-Breed,\" \"Dark Lady\" and \"I Found Someone\" from 1987, and later in her career, Cher has still remained the harshest critic of her work -- specifically her solo career.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\n\"I'm not a Cher fan,\" said Cher in 2017, adding that she was ashamed of her early songs and always wished she sounded more like Joni Mitchell, Bob Seger, the Eagles, or Bruce Springsteen. \"I just don't think my aesthetic taste lies in her [Cher's] direction.\"\n\n[RELATED: The Story Behind Cher's Smash Hit \"Believe\"]\n\n'It's a Man's World'\n\nWhen Cher signed to Warner in the early 1990s, her first album, It's a Man's World, was another disappointment and an album she called \"crap.\" Cher added, \"I don't remember what's on it. I didn't like any of it.\"\n\nThe album was a collection of songs, including covers of Don Henley's \"Not Enough Love in This World,\" Marc Cohn's \"Walking in Memphis,\" and James Brown's \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World,\" along with two original songs, co-written by Cher and The Real People's Anthony Griffiths, \"One By One,\" and \"The Gunman, which she wrote with Paddy McAloon (Prefab Sprout).\n\nAt the time, then Warner UK president Rob Dickins asked Cher to release a dance album in the UK, which she refused. \"So he said, 'Let me rephrase that,'\" she recalled. \"'I'm going to send you some songs -- when you like them, tell me.'\"\n\nIt's a Man's World peaked at No. 64 in the U.S. and reached the top 10 in the UK.\n\n\"Believe\"\n\nBy the end of the \"90s, Cher was working on her 22nd album Believe, which went to No. 4 on the Billboard 200. The title track also topped the charts in 23 countries, including the U.S., and gave Cher, who was then 52, her fifth No. 1 hit.\n\nRegardless of its success, Cher didn't initially connect to \"Believe\" and called its recording \"a nightmare.\" In Mark Bego's 2001 book Cher: If You Believe, Cher revealed more from the experience and how she rewrote some of the lyrics to suit her better. \"I was singing [the song] in the bathtub, and it seemed to me the second verse was too whiny,\" said Cher. \"It kind of pissed me off, so I changed it. I toughened it up a bit.\"\n\nShe then wrote the lyrics It takes time to move on / It takes love to be strong / I've had time to think it through and maybe I'm too good for you but she never received songwriting credit on the track.\n\nAfter arguing with producer Mark Taylor, Cher stormed out of Dreamhouse Studio in West London in the middle of recording \"Believe.\" Her vocals on the track were auto-tuned and became known as the \"Cher Effect.\"\n\nRegardless of any hardship around the recording the title track, \"Believe\" earned Cher another Grammy for Best Dance Recording.\n\nPhoto:

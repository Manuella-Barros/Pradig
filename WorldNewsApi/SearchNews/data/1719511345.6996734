Enrique coached the French player Mbappe during the last year of the seven years that the French national team captain spent with Paris Saint-Germain, a period during which the striker scored a record 256 goals and helped his team achieve 15 titles, including six titles in the French First Division. Enrique said that the period leading up to the start of the new season will be necessary to prepare his team to live up to expectations next season, as no player can replace Mbappe, who reports indicate that he may join the Spanish giant Real Madrid. Enrique said in a press conference, \u201cI had the good fortune to coach Kylian this season. It was a difficult season for him after seven years he spent at his club and after everything he achieved, it is difficult to say goodbye.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is no alternative to Mbappe. We cannot find a replacement for him. We will do that through the team and four, five, or six contracts that we can conclude.\u201d \u201cKylian\u2019s replacement will be the team that, together with the fans and our ambition, will try to win all the titles in the following seasons.\u201d Winning the Champions League remains the biggest challenge facing Paris Saint-Germain, after it was a long wait to achieve its first title in the first European club championship, despite the huge investments in the team after its loss in the semi-finals to Borussia Dortmund earlier this month. Enrique said, \u201cThe big challenge facing any player who wants to join the team is that we want to make history and this club will win the Champions League sooner or later. It is difficult, but this team will achieve it.\u201d He added, \u201cThis season is coming to an end, but negotiations have already begun and there are possibilities to improve the team. It is still an impressive project.\u201d Any big team demands a lot to achieve and the players need to adapt. \u201cThere is no such thing as a holiday in high-level teams in the world of football.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique said after his team won the French Cup last night that his team and the new players who will join in the summer transfer period will have to improve their performance in light of the departure of the team&#8217;s all-time top scorer Kylian Mbappe.
